      "make sure that the area is a safe place, especially if you plan on walking home at night.  It’s always a good idea to practice the buddy system.  Have a friend meet up and walk with you. Research the bus, train, or streetcar routes available in your area to find safe and affordable travel to your destination.  Make sure you check the schedule for your outgoing and return travel.  Some public transportation will cease to run late at night.  Be sure if you take public transportation to the venue that you will also be able to get home late at night. Check the routes.  Even if some public transit is still running late at night, the routing may change.  Some may run express past many of the stops, or not travel all the way to the ends.  Be sure that your stop will still be available when you need it for your return trip. If you are taking public transit in a vulnerable state after drinking, it is always a good idea to travel in groups.  Having friends available is a good way to stay safe and make sure that you reach your destination. This is more expensive option than a taxi or ride share service, but could be a fun and fancy way to stay safe and ensure that you will have a ride home. Plan this service in advance with a scheduled time to pick you up from your home and the venue.  You want to be sure that the service will still be available when you need to get home. This may be easy in a large city, but taxis may be less frequent in smaller towns.  This is especially true late at night, so this is a less reliable option than scheduling a ride in advance.  Have a friend accompany you and help you flag a cab to make sure you are able to get one. Set up a plan to call a friend when you get home to make sure that you made it safely to your destination. If there are no taxis readily available call a local service to send a car to pick you up. You can share a ride with your friends, or other people using the app at the same moment.  If you are in a vulnerable state it is best to share the ride with your friends to make sure you get home safe. You can request the car to yourself rather than sharing rides with strangers. If you travel home on your own or are the last of your group to be dropped off, make plans to call a friend when you get home so they know you made it safely to your destination. There may be a designated driver service in your area which can chauffeur your group.  Make reservations with them in advance and keep their contact information handy while you are drinking.",
      "Designating a driver is a very popular tactic to avoid drinking and driving.  It is important to plan in advance, because your brain function will slow down and your decision making skills will be impaired once you start drinking. Decide before you begin drinking that you will not drive.  Figure out who will be getting you home before you leave. Make sure this person is responsible and keep them in your sight while you are drinking.  Have their contact information handy in case you can’t find them when you are ready to leave.  Choose a friend who doesn’t drink alcohol.  You likely have someone in your friend group who doesn’t drink.  This person is the most likely to remain sober. Decide on one person who will remain sober.  You can take turns within your friend group, alternating who will be the designated driver on each occasion.  Be sure that the designated driver actually remains sober.  The person who has drank the least is still not sober. If you don’t have your car with you, you can guarantee that you won’t make the choice to drive it home. If you are drinking at your home.  Give your keys to a responsible friend to ensure that you don't choose to drive somewhere after you have been drinking. It may be tempting to stay longer or leave with someone else.  Stick to the plan you made in advance and only leave with your sober, designated driver.  Keep the phone number of your driver handy in case you can't find them when you are ready to leave. If your designated driver drinks alcohol, find alternate transportation to get home.",
      "If you have been drinking at all you are at least on the spectrum of drunkenness.  You could be showing signs of impairment and slower brain function including lack of motor skills and slower reaction time, leading to the inability to operate a motor vehicle.  Some of these signs could be:  Poor balance or stumbling.  Difficulty speaking clearly and slurred words.  Abnormal behavior leading to you doing things you wouldn’t normally do if you were sober. As soon as you notice that you are showing signs of impairment, give your keys to a friend, the host or the bartender to ensure that you won’t drive until you are sober.  Make sure to only give them your car key.  Hold onto your house keys. If your friend, the host or the bartender are advising you not to drive, you are likely too drunk.  Listen to their advice and acknowledge that they are trying to help you. Bystander intervention is common when it comes to drinking and driving.  Many people will be willing to step in, take your keys and help you get home safely.  If no one if offering to help, you may need to ask.  Take a ride from a sober friend.  It is best to get in a car with someone you trust when you are in this vulnerable state. Allow the host or bartender to call a cab or car service to take you home. If you are having a difficult time finding a safe way to get home, find a place to stay which does not involve you driving.  Ask the host of the party if there is a place you can sleep.  Give them your keys and ask that they keep them in a safe place until the morning. Stay with a friend if they live nearby and are on their way home. Find a hotel within walking distance.  Call them to book a room, or have a friend help you secure one.  Ask the friend if they will walk you to the hotel and make sure you get checked in safely. There are people in your life who care about you and want to be sure that you are safe.  It may seem scary or embarrassing to call your parents or your siblings if you are too drunk to drive, but they will be glad you did.  Your safety is the most important. You may need your phone to call someone for a ride or get help from a friend.  Be sure to charge your phone before you leave the house.  It is also a good idea to bring a charger with you in case your battery dies before the end of the night or you end up staying where you are and need to get home the next morning. You may also want to invest in a portable battery charger for your phone should there not be a power outlet available.  Make sure it is fully charged before you leave your house.  Keep it handy in your pocket or your bag throughout the night."

      "Calculating Your Annualized Return",
      "Laying the Groundwork"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Once you've calculated the total return (as above), plug the result into this equation: Annualized Return=(1+ Return)1/N-1 The outcome of this equation will be a number that corresponds to your return each year over the full span of time.  In the exponent (the little number outside the parentheses), the “1” represents the unit we are measuring, which is 1 year. If you wish to be more specific, you could use “365” to capture a daily return. The “N” represents the number of periods that we are measuring. So, if you are measuring your return over 7 years, you would use the number 7 in the place of \"N.\" For example, suppose that over a seven-year period, your portfolio grew in value from $1,000 to $2,500. First, calculate your overall return: (2,500-1,000)/1000 = 1.50 (a return of 150%). Next, calculate your annualized return: (1 + 1.50)1/7-1 = 0.1399=13.99% annual return. That's all there is to it! Use the ordinary mathematical order of operations: do the operations inside the parentheses first, then apply the exponent, then do the subtraction. Now, let's say that you want to find semiannual returns (returns occurring twice a year, every six months) over the course of this seven-year period.  The formula stays the same; you only need to adjust the number of periods that you are measuring. Your final result will be a semiannual return.  In this case, you will have 14 semiannual periods, two per year over the course of seven years. First, calculate your overall return: (2,500-1,000)/1000 = 1.50 (a return of 150%). Next, calculate your annualized return: (1 + 1.50)1/14-1 = 6.76%. You can convert this into an annual return by simply multiplying by 2: 6.76% x 2 = 13.52%. You can also calculate the annualized equivalent of shorter returns. For example, imagine you only had a six-month return and wanted to know its annualized equivalent. Once again, the formula stays the same.  Suppose over a six-month period, your portfolio increases in value from $1,000 to $1,050. Start by calculating your overall return: (1,050-1,000)/1,000=.05 (a 5% return over six  months). Now if you wanted to know what the annualized equivalent would be (assuming a continuation of this rate of return and compounding returns),  you would calculate the following: (1+.05)1/.50-1=10.25% annual return. No matter how long or short the period of time, if you follow the formula above, you will always be able to convert your performance into an annualized return.",
      "In discussing annualized portfolio returns, there are several key terms that will come up repeatedly and are important for you to understand. These are as follows:  Annual Return: Total return earned on an investment over a period of one calendar year, including dividends, interest, and capital gains.   Annualized Return: Yearly rate of return which is inferred by extrapolating returns measured over periods either shorter or longer than one calendar year.   Average Return: Typical return earned per time period calculated by taking the total  return realized over a longer period and spreading it evenly over the (shorter) periods.   Compounding Return: A return that includes the results of re-investing interest, dividends, and capital gains.    Period: A specific length of time chosen to measure and calculate return, such as daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. Periodic Return: The total return of an investment measured over a specific length of time. Compounding returns are growth on the gains that you have already earned. The longer your money compounds, the faster it will grow, and the greater your annualized returns will be. (Think of a snowball rolling downhill, getting bigger faster as it rolls.)  Let’s say you invest $100 and earn 100% on it your first year, leaving you with $200 at the end of year one. If you gain just 10% in the second year, you will have earned $20 on your $200 by the end of year two. However, if we say you earned just 50% during the first year, you would have $150 at the beginning of the second year. That same 10% gain in year two would earn 15 dollars rather than 20. This is a full 33% less than the 20 dollars you would have made in our first example. To further illustrate, let’s say you lost 50% in year one, leaving you with just 50 dollars. You would then need to earn 100% just to get back to even (100% of $50 = $50, and $50 + $50 = $100). The size and timing of gains play a huge role when accounting for compound returns and their effect on annualized returns. In other words, annualized returns are not a reliable measure of actual gains or losses. Annualized returns are, however, a good tool to use when comparing various investments against each other. To find the average of many things, such as daily rainfall or weight loss over several months, you can often use a simple average, or arithmetic mean. This is a technique you probably learned in school. However, the simple average does not account for the effect that each periodic return has on the others, or the timing of each return. To accomplish this, we can use a time-weighted geometric return. (Don’t worry, we’ll walk you through this formula!)  Using a simple average doesn’t work because all periodic returns are dependent on each other.   For example, imagine that you want to tabulate your average return on $100 over the course of two years. You earned 100% in the first year, meaning you had $200 at the end of year one (100% of 100 = 100). You lost 50% during the second, meaning you had $100 at the end of the second year (50% of 200 = 100). This is the same figure you started with at the beginning of year one. A simple average (arithmetic mean) would add the two returns together and divide by the number of periods, which in this example is two years. The result would suggest that you earned an average return of 25% per year. However, when you link the two returns, you can see that you actually earned nothing. The years cancel each other out. To start, you must calculate your total return over the full span of time you are assessing. For the purpose of clarity, we’ll use an example where no deposits or withdrawals were made. To calculate your total return, all you need is two numbers: the beginning portfolio value and ending value.  Subtract your Beginning Value from your Ending Value. Divide this number by your Beginning Value. The resulting number is your Return. In the case of a loss in the period under scrutiny, subtract the ending balance from the beginning balance. Then, divide by the beginning balance and consider the result a negative value. (This latter operation is a substitute for needing to add algebraically a negative number.)   Do the subtraction first, then the division. This will give you your overall percent of return. The formula for Total Return Rate = (Ending portfolio value- beginning portfolio value)/beginning portfolio value. The formula for Compound Rate of Return = POWER((1 + Total Return Rate),(1/years)) - 1. For example, if the beginning value of the portfolio was $1000 and its ending value was $2500 seven years later, the calculations would be:  Total Return Rate = (2500-1000)/1000 = 1.5. Compound Rate of Return= POWER ((1 + 1.5),(1/7))-1 = .1398 = 13.98%."

      "You will need four pieces of ribbon that are long enough to wrap around the box lengthwise, plus an additional 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).  For a unique look, consider using two pieces of thin ribbon, and two pieces of slightly wider ribbon. You can also use two contrasting colors instead. Thick and/or wired ribbon is not a good choice. Use thin satin or balloon ribbon for best results. Use the same ribbon as in the previous step. This time, cut the ribbon long enough so that it can wrap around the box widthwise, plus 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). Take the four long ribbons, and set them down on the table. Make sure that they are parallel to each other and spaced no more than ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) apart. If you used different widths and/or colors, be sure to alternate them. Place your gift face-down on the ribbons. The box can be centered or off-center, depending on where you want the ribbons to be. Wrap and tape each of the ribbons one at a time; do not tape all of them at once. Pull the ribbons firmly around the box so that they are nice and snug. The ribbon ends will overlap each other by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).  Make sure that you are only taping the top ribbon to the bottom ribbon; don't tape the ribbons to the box itself. You can also use glue dots (found in the scrapbooking aisle of an arts and crafts store) instead of double-sided tape. Place a strip of double-sided tape onto the end of each of your short ribbon. Arrange the ribbons right above the first, long ribbon, making sure that the ends are perpendicular to it. Once again, keep the ribbons spaced no more than ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) apart. Pull your short ribbons around to the front of the box. Weave the first one over and under across the first set of ribbons. Weave the next ribbon under and over, and so on. Continue weaving until you have woven all four ribbons. Flip the box over again. Secure a strip of double-sided tape to the end of each ribbon, then press the ribbons down one by one to the back of the box. Make sure that the ends of the ribbons match up. For a nicer touch, weave the short ribbons through the long ribbons on the back, just like you did for the front. The woven ribbons are part of the design. If you feel that your gift is lacking something, you can buy or make a matching bow, then secure it to the box. Instead of covering up all your hard work, set the bow off to the side so that the weaving is still visible.",
      "Leave about 4 to 8 inches (10.16 to 20.32 centimeters) hanging off the side for the tail of the bow. Do not cut the ribbon yet. It is better to leave more ribbon hanging off the side than too little. You can always cut it shorter later. Do not flip the box over, or you may lose your place. Instead, lift the box up and bring the rest of the ribbon behind it. Set the box back down once the ribbon comes out the other side. Bring the ribbon towards the middle of the box, then bring the shorter end to meet it. Twist the ribbons around each other so that they are oriented vertically. If your ribbon has a right and wrong side, you may have to twist it twice so that you don't see the wrong side of the ribbon. Lift the box up again. Pull the longer part of the ribbon behind the box and out the other side. Set the box down again. Place your thumb against the twisted part to keep it secure as you wrap the ribbon around the back. Bring your ribbon back towards the middle of the box. Measure it against the end of the ribbon from the beginning and cut it. Pull the ribbon across the front of the twisted part at an angle. Bring it under the twisted part, and back out the way you started. Pull on both ends of the ribbon to tighten the knot. Fold both end of the ribbon into loops. Cross the left loop over the right one to make a smaller loop in the middle. Pull the left loop through that smaller loop, then pull to tighten. Take a moment to adjust the loops and the tails. If you used a wired ribbon, you can fluff the loops up as well. For a fancier touch, cut the ends of the tails into angles or Vs.",
      "Leave about 4 to 8 inches (10.16 to 20.32 centimeters) hanging off of the left side of the corner. Keep the rest of the ribbon on the spool on the top edge. Take the spool-side of the ribbon and pull it behind the top right corner, down towards the bottom right corner. Keep your thumb over the ribbon on the top left corner so that it doesn't fall off. Keep the wraps nice and snug so that they don't slide off of the corners. At this point, it would be a good idea to take a moment to adjust the positions of the wrapped ribbons on each of the corners. If they look like they are slipping off, pull them further from the corners. Bring both ribbons towards the center of the top left corner. Measure the spool ribbon against the other ribbon, and cut it down to match. Cross the left ribbon over and under the right, then tug on both ends to tighten them. Fold both ribbons into loops, then cross the right one over the left—just like tying a shoe! Once the bow is tight and secure, snip off the excess ribbon at the tails. For a fancier touch, cut them at angles or into notches."

      "Not all healthy ingredients are expensive. In fact, many healthy ingredients are cheap. Take each category of food you need to buy, and figure out options in each one.  For instance, in whole grains, you can try oatmeal, brown rice, bulgur, popcorn, and whole-wheat bread and pasta. For vegetables, pick ones like cabbage, leafy greens (like mustard greens, kale, or even broccoli), squash, carrots, and celery. In fruit, go for cheaper options, such as oranges, apples, and bananas. In the dairy section, reach for milk and plain yogurt in large containers. Milk and yogurt can be flavored at home at minimal cost. Keep in mind that you probably need less protein than you think in your diet. Making your proteins last across several meals will help both your budget and your diet. For instance, if you make a chicken dish one night, use the leftovers the next night to make a chicken soup. The night after that, use some of the chicken in tacos.  Adult women under 30 only need 5 1/2 ounce-equivalents each day, while women over 30 only need 5 ounce-equivalents. Adult men under 30 need 6 1/2, while if you're 30 to 50, you need 6 ounce-equivalents and 5 1/2 if you're over 50. An \"ounce-equivalent\" is one ounce (28 grams) of meat (3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards). While you don't need to completely cut animal protein out of your diet, opting for plant-based protein sometimes can help cut costs. Try focusing meals around these vegetarian options, such as having beans and rice one night instead of chili.  Some vegetarian equivalents to an ounce of meat include an egg, 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of beans, peas, or lentils, 1/2 an ounce (14 grams) of nuts or seeds, a tablespoon (15 milliliters) of peanut butter, or 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of hummus.  Extend your proteins with vegetables and complex carbohydrates. Combining a modest amount of meat with healthy extenders can make not only a healthier but also more filling meal. Consider:  Stir fry Tacos Pasta dishes While you need to compare prices on foods, you should also compare labels for items you're buying, particularly if you're buying prepacked food of any kind. For instance, if you must have a box of macaroni and cheese, it's best to pick the healthiest one you can find.  Look for foods low in sugar and sodium. You should be eating about 2,300 milligrams (1 teaspoon) of salt per day. Also, check for lower trans and saturated fat. Even the healthier fats should only be 20 to 30 percent of what you eat. Keep serving sizes to 400 calories or less. Also, check to see how many vitamins and minerals foods you purchase have.",
      "When fruits and vegetables are in season, they tend to cost less. Often, grocery stores will run sales on what's in season because they know customers expect certain fruits and veggies at certain times of the year. As an added bonus, when things are in season, they taste better.  In fall, look for produce like pumpkins, winter squash, cabbage, and apples. In the winter, opt for winter squash, cabbage, and other root vegetables. Springtime is great for produce like beets, leafy greens, spring onions, and asparagus. Summer is a good time for watermelon, corn, and berries, just to name a few. You'll likely notice the cheapest produce prices in summer. Also, because produce is cheaper this time of year, you can buy extra and freeze it or can it yourself. While you may prefer fresh fruits and vegetables, you can often save money by opting for frozen or canned instead. These options have the same health benefits, though be sure to pick ones that don't have added sugar or salt. Check your proteins, too. Frozen chicken may be cheaper than fresh, and canned salmon and tuna is likely cheaper than fresh fish. Most grocery stores run weekly specials, which you can learn about through their weekly ads. When something is on sale, that's the time to stock up on it. Most protein can be frozen and saved for later, for instance, so if your store is running a sale on boneless, skinless chicken breasts, buy some to use and save for later. You probably already know to check for the lowest prices on the items you're buying. However, you may get stuck in a rut buying a certain brand and assuming it's the cheapest because it always has been. However, be vigilant, as prices change all the time. Occasionally there is a sale on a certain package size, or a discount on a run of product that changes what is the most affordable option.   Look up and down, as grocery stores tend to put the most expensive items at eye level. Keep an eye on store brands-- they tend to be cheaper. While buying in bulk can come with a higher price upfront, it'll be cheaper overall. For instance, buying a large can of quick oatmeal is much cheaper than buying a box of the instant packets. Add some fresh fruit to create your own flavors.  You can also buy some items in bulk bins at health food stores. Often these stores will have items like grains, beans, pastas, nuts, granolas, flours, and sugars. You can get just what you need, taking advantage of the cheaper prices without having to buy more than you need. Bulk items require timely use. Do not fall into the trap of buying an entire gallon of mayonnaise that you will never use up before it expires, or that bargain box of cereal that no one in the family will eat. Take advantage of coupons when you come across them. However, only use them for the foods you would buy anyway. If you're buying something you don't normally buy--even if it is inexpensive--you may be spending extra money for a product you do not want. You can find coupons online, as well as in the newspaper. You can also use a variety of coupon apps to save money. If you are low-income, you might qualify for SNAP or WIC. SNAP is the contemporary version of food stamps, and you get your assistance on a debit-type card. WIC is only for women with low income who have young children. Pregnant women also qualify. It's also more restrictive about what you can buy, but it can still help you afford healthy food.  Visit your local SNAP office to apply in person, or you can apply online in many states. Check if you can apply online in your state at https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/apply. To apply for WIC, contact your local WIC office. Sometimes, you can find cheaper produce at the farmer's market, though you must hunt for deals. Also, driving out to local farms to pick your own produce can make it cheaper, as well. Be ready to use what you buy, though, as farm-fresh produce doesn't tend to last as long as grocery market produce, which is bred and treated to last longer. However, you'll make up for it in flavor. Some farmer's markets even accept SNAP.",
      "Often, having a small garden or even a few potted plants can be a cheap way to get in the veggies you need. Try growing a tomato plant, for instance, or even just a few herbs on your window sill. You can buy pre-made snacks at the store that are a bit healthier than your average chips, such as veggie chips or fruit cups. However, they tend to be expensive, so making your own at home is a more affordable alternative.  For example, try making kale chips. Wash and dry kale thoroughly. Chop or tear the leaves into large pieces. Toss them in olive oil, or spray them with cooking spray, and then spread them out on a large baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle salt and pepper on top and any other seasoning you want. Bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius) until crispy (about 15 minutes). You can also make yourself individual cups of fruits and veggies. For instance, cut up oranges, apples, and grapefruit, and toss them with a tiny bit of honey. Spoon them into small reusable containers so you can grab them any time. You can do the same with veggies. Cut them into bite-sized pieces, and put them in reusable bags. Spoon out (homemade) hummus into individual containers to go with them. Stocks and broths are a great way to start out soups, but buying them in cans or cartons can get expensive. Plus, they're often loaded with extra sodium. Making your own at home results in better quality, and it's cheaper, too.  You can even make a stock with your scraps. Save the bits of vegetables you have leftover, such as onion skins, the ends of carrots, and the tops of celery. When you eat a chicken, save the bones and the bits of meat. Freeze them in a bag until you have enough. When you do, throw them in a pot and cover them with water. Boil them (covered on low heat) for six to eight hours or until you have a stock with a flavor you like. Strain it, and your stock is ready. Once you have your stock, you can portion it out in small containers and freeze it. Lots of foods besides snacks and broths can be made cheaper at home. For instance, if you eat yogurt often, making your own yogurt might be a good option. For bread, consider investing in a bread making machine, so you can make your own bread at the push of a button.",
      "Making a meal plan will help you to only buy what you need and therefore stay under budget. If you don't already have healthy recipes you love, find some you like online, do some research with recipes books, or ask your friends for recommendations.  One site you can try is the USDA's What's Cooking website (https://whatscooking.fns.usda.gov/). It has healthy recipes that you can use to plan meals. Don't forget to plan around your schedule. Opt for leftovers or quick meals on nights you're going to be busy. You may think that eating healthy means you need to try out a bunch of new trendy health foods. While these trendy foods may be healthy, that doesn't mean they're the only healthy foods. Stick to simpler ingredients that you know, even something as simple as a roasted chicken with vegetables and brown rice. You'll be more likely to keep eating healthy, and you'll save money at the same time. Once you've planned out your meals, create a list of the items you'll need. Sticking to a list (and not buying extras) can help you stay on budget, so you can afford healthier food. Meal planning isn't just for eating at home. It can help to make a plan before you go to a restaurant. Look over the menu if it's available online, and compare calorie counts. Many restaurants have the calorie counts available, but you can also use online calorie counters or websites.  Consider choosing a healthy appetizer to save money. It will also keep the portion small. Opt for dishes with lean proteins paired with whole grains and lots of veggies. Choose veggies or fruit over fries, onion rings, or mashed potatoes. Ask for a take-out box when you get your food. Split it in half before you start eating, and put half in the box to take home. Splitting it up helps you control your portion and stretch your money."

      "Since you don’t know exactly how your new dog will act when you get it home, it’s best to remove all items that might be enticing for a dog to eat or destroy. For example, put all food and chemicals out of reach of a dog so that it doesn’t eat them and get sick. Also put fragile items away until you know how your new dog will act. Set up a space that has a bed and food and water dishes. This space will be for the dog as it gets used to its new home, so it should be an area that can be blocked off so the dog is kept there. Keeping the dog in this small space will help you keep and eye on it and will reduce how overwhelmed the dog may get from getting to know a large new home immediately on arrival.  It’s a good idea for this area to have a hard, stain-resistant flooring, in case your new dog has an accident. Depending on your home, this could be a bathroom, a kitchen, or an extra room that doesn’t have a lot of fragile or precious items in it. When you bring a new dog home, bring along something that has its smell on it, such as a blanket, toy, or other item it has used. This smell will help the dog feel comfortable and calm as it adjusts to its new life.  That way, even after you give the dog a bath, it will still have something that smells familiar. Ask the person you are dealing with during your dog adoption for an item that you can take with you, even if it's just a small toy. If your dog doesn't have an item like this, that is fine. However, it's a nice thing if it does. When you bring a new dog home it’s important to get its health assessed right away. Have a check up done within a week of having a new dog so that you can get any health conditions treated right away.  If you don’t know what veterinarian to go to, ask friends, family, and the people who you adopted the dog from for suggestions in your area. During your first veterinary visit you should set up a vaccination schedule for the future.",
      "A new dog will feel most secure in its new home if it can depend on the same things happening every day. Walking it, feeding it, and putting it to bed at the same time will go a long way towards it feeling at home. A consistent schedule will also help it avoid having accidents in the house. Being fed at the same time and going out at the same time every day will allow its system to adjust quickly to its new life. When your dog gets home you can start training it after it has acclimated for a day or 2, even if it's a puppy as young as 8 weeks old. Begin with simple commands, such as \"sit.\" Say the word \"sit\" every time the dog does that action naturally and give it a treat. As the dog figures out that the action it is doing is connected to the treats and the verbal cue, it will begin doing it on command. As you dog learns add more commands, such as \"lie down,\" \"stay,\" and \"fetch.\"",
      "It can be overwhelming for a dog to meet a large number of people while it is adjusting to a whole new life. Instead, only have direct family members at home when the dog arrives and make sure that they give the dog some physical space while it adjusts. Tell potential visitors that they will need to wait at least a few days before meeting your new dog. Give it physical space and don’t get it excited by being loud or active. It’s best just to promote calmness and make activities as routine as possible.  Don’t take the dog to a dog park or crowded street for a few weeks after getting it. You need to know how the dog is likely to react to these kind of environments before taking it to them. Don't overdo it with physical affection or playing right off the bat. If you tackle your dog in a way that it sees as beyond just playful rough housing, it might get defensive or aggressive."

You may cry, withdraw from friends or family, or find it difficult to get excited about interesting things happening in your life. All of this is normal. Supportive people may look different on any given day; you may find yourself looking to friends for a distraction while a support group may be best for relating to others who have been there too.  There may be times where the best form of support is a distraction, that’s where a good group of friends comes in handy because they will probably be more than happy to find something fun to do if all you need to do is anything besides divorce “stuff”. Support groups can be a great place to really explore the feelings tied to the divorce since they usually have a set start and end time, allow that small block of time each week to dive into things and deal with the feelings. It is also a good way to form boundaries with others if you do not want to talk about it with them since you can nicely let them know you are attending a group to talk about things. You may find yourself feeling a variety of emotions, but going without eating or not keeping up with normal gym times will only make those feelings worse. The divorce process also often takes a lot of formal paperwork so being at your mental best is important.  Many people simply forget to eat when under stress or the opposite they overeat to mask feelings. Try to remind yourself to eat a healthy diet to stay focused on what needs to be done and to stay healthy. Eating right also includes not falling into the trap of drinking more alcohol or depending on extra coffee to mask emotions or not sleeping. It is better to address the underlying issue instead of using some sort of substance to hide the cause. . Make sure you have outlets to relieve the stress that comes with getting a divorce. Stress management can cover a range of options, including meditation, listening to music, getting a massage at the spa, or playing with a pet.  Make time daily, if possible, to do something that relaxes you and eases your stress. Self-medicating with alcohol, drugs or even too much caffeine is not managing your stress, it is just numbing it. Some people going through a divorce may stop eating, stop performing at work, and feel hopeless about the future. Depression is common during such an ordeal. A marriage and family therapist counselor can help you work through your emotions and venting by offering you personalized support without judgment, and they can help you sort out your life.  Such a therapist can also help you sort through logistical details like talking about the divorce with your children or how to know when you're ready to start dating again. Your divorce lawyer may be able to refer you to a quality therapist who is experienced in working with people going through divorce.",
      "The children will handle the news better if they see that both of you are involved in the choice,even if that isn’t fully the case, and you will remain their parents regardless of the divorce. Before you have the talk with the children, take a bit of time together to decide how you will answer the questions about why you are divorcing. Both of you need to be on the same page about the “why” and not placing blame on one party or the other. They may often be fearful of what life is going to look like from now on, so be ready for a lot of logistical questions. Allow the children to ask you both anything, but also understand you may not have all the answers and that’s OK. They may want to know about where they will live in the future or if you will remarry. Those issues are not easily answered and you can always tell them you do not know yet.  If they ask questions about why the two of you are divorcing, this is not the time to pour your heart out to them. They are not your support system, and they do not need to know details about what has happened. Even if you are not sure where everyone will end up living, reassure the children that they will be safe and have access to both parents. Security is a big part of their fear at this point, seeing that both parents are on the same page even if one moves physically out will help. Part of supporting the children through this process is also giving them the freedom to talk about it with you and with others if they need to. Feeling like they need to keep this “secret” can be very stressful for children, tell them who else you are telling so they know other adults they can talk to if they need to. Set clear boundaries as far as which parent is staying in the home and what time with either one of you will look like.  As the children process this news, they need to know what to expect. This means being clear about what happens after one of you moves out and how your family will look going forward. The parent who moves out should not be staying over, for example, since this sends a mixed message. Of course, some married couples are able to eventually work things out, but this is not always the case. If you are trying to work things out, this should not be done in front of the children, in case it does not work. Your marriage is ending but you are both still adults, staying civil with the soon to be ex-spouse will make co-parenting easier.  Your children may feel like they are stuck in the middle if they see one or both of you angry at the other. They need to know they do not need to make a choice as far as only “loving” one of you. In addition, it is not fair to them to say negative things about your spouse to them. During the transition, there may be times where things feel awkward, but they should never get to the point where either of you react out of anger or violence. Your spouse is no longer a love interest, but he or she will always be a parent. Focus on that. Neither parent should ask the children to supply details about the other parent like if he or she is dating anyone new or other non-essential details. That’s not related to the children and it’s not any of your business. The fact is, even after a divorce, you are still family because you share a child or children. Addressing the adjustment for the new dynamics or giving each member of the family time to openly talk about their feelings is a good use of family therapy.  Children do need to understand this is not a time to force their parents back together, it is about moving forward with the new separation. The therapist may see the family all together or different variations of the group depending on what needs to be discussed.",
      "If you are a stay-at-home parent, explore what type of arrangement will support the household going forward. Depending on the divorce agreement, moving may or may not be an option. That is important to keep in mind if you are looking for a new job since you may need to stay in the local area. Even if you end up getting spousal support, you still need to learn how to manage household expenses on your own.  Tracking how you spend your money will give you a better idea about areas that may need to change or be cut all together. Suddenly going from two incomes to one will change the disposable income. Mistakes in the settlement process can impact you far beyond the immediate future. That's why it's very important to thoroughly understand the process and your rights. . The divorce requires that you rethink the trajectory of your life completely. Choose a few goals to move towards over the next months and years, such as buying a home or going back to school. SMART goals are those that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely Get a sheet of paper and write out goals that meet these criteria. Then, come up with actionable steps you can take to reach them. Return to your goals on a regular basis to track your progress. After being a part of a couple for any length of time, you may find yourself a bit lost if you suddenly have free time. Trying a new hobby is a way to explore something new, and to meet new people without the pressure of dating too soon.  A hobby is also a good distraction if you go from a full time parent to the children being gone part of the time; it gives you something to do as you get used to the free time. Even before you are ready to date again, you need to take time for yourself. With the responsibilities of marriage you may have sacrificed some of your previous passions. Perhaps you always wanted to go back to school. Or, you once enjoyed baking, but soon lost the energy to create complex recipes. Maybe you simple enjoyed reading yourself to sleep or practicing a certain religion. Consider a passion or pastime that you once enjoyed and consider trying it out again. Your divorce could represent a door opening for you to rediscover a long lost love. You may hear all sorts of advice about when you should date or “get back on the horse” so to speak, but your own personal feelings on the subject matter the most. Only get back out there when you have dealt with your divorce emotionally and mentally and feel capable of being a true partner in a new relationship. Here are some tips for getting back out there.  Don't divulge too much information about yourself too soon. Spoon-feed on the details until you feel comfortable that the connection is going somewhere. Relax your expectations and decrease the pressure. Instead of dating to look for a long-term partner, just start off having a good time. Try creating an online profile. Casually messaging someone online might reduce some of your newly dating nerves. However, be sure to practice safe dating methods and protect yourself, if you decide to meet in-person."

      "Barley straw (the stalk of the plant after the grain has been harvested) is a great option for this and means they can happily munch for hours on end without gaining weight. a morning and evening 'bucket feed'. You should avoid feeding your donkey any cereals or grains such as oats, barley, wheat and corn (maize). These products are too high in starch and sugar and have been implicated in the development of diseases such as laminitis in donkeys, as well as a leading cause of obesity. Its hard to say specifically how much grass a pair of donkeys needs as grazing can vary so much. Grass should be considered an additional to straw, rather than making up the majority of their diets. Donkeys always need to have something to nibble on so make sure you keep an adequate supply of straw available at all times.   During the winter, when the grass is dead, or at other times of year when there's not enough grass, you can supplement your donkey's diet with meadow hay. This needs to be good quality in terms of being clean, well produced and mould-free, late-cut hay may be better as it is higher in fibre and lower in sugar. Avoid alfalfa unless you have a pregnant or nursing mare, or other special need animals. Make sure it's not old or spoiled, or your donkey could become sick. If you can afford chaff with additives that target hooves, coats, and so on, you may want to investigate the options available. Chaff tends to be suitable for older donkeys with teeth troubles, convalescing donkeys and nursing donkeys.  Be careful not to overfeed your donkey. Donkeys become ill with life-threatening diseases when they eat too much protein and other nutrient-rich food. Donkeys evolved in the arid and semi-arid areas of the Middle East and North Africa, and as a result can get all the nutrients they need from high fibre, scrubby pasture. When grass is too rich or abundant (think dairy or horse pasture), you might have to limit the area available to them to prevent them from eating too much and gaining too much weight. Rigging up a safe, movable electric fence will allow you to portion off the field and restrict the amount they can eat. Move the fence regularly to give them a little bit of fresh grazing. As stated above, donkeys put on weight easily, so be careful with the treats. Give no more than a handful of any treat at a time. Apples, carrots and bananas (skins on) are ideal. Scraps from your kitchen are not a good idea as donkeys will have trouble digesting anything from the brassica family (broccoli, cauliflower etc.), potatoes, onions and many more. Fresh or dried mint leaves make a great treat. Donkeys need a simple, healthy diet and this doesn't include things like toast, biscuits or cakes. Steer clear of highly processed, sugary human and equine snacks for donkeys.  Here are a few supplements your vet may recommend:   An equine specific salt/mineral licking-block may be helpful, but check with your vet first. Chose one that doesn't contain molasses, otherwise they will just be licking the block for the sweet sugar taste. High fibre cubes—may be fed to donkeys needing to gain a little weight, try to find one targeted specifically for donkeys (you may be out of luck here depending where you live), or a second best would be one for good-doers and ponies.     {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/98\\/65774-13.jpg\\/v4-460px-65774-13.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/98\\/65774-13.jpg\\/aid65774-v4-728px-65774-13.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  Freeze-dried grass—may be a useful supplement for some ill, underweight donkeys to get them back on form, make sure it is pesticide-free, and never feed a donkey grass clippings as the type of grass may be harmful to the donkey. Be cautious feeding freeze dried grass in any quantity as the high sugar levels could be dangerous to a healthy animal and trigger the painful hoof disease called laminitis. Protein pellets/cubes—these pre-made pellets contain essential nutrients; they're useful for nursing mothers with foals or for donkeys living through very cold winters that might need a boost. Otherwise, this feed is too rich for everyday purposes. Never substitute with pellets meant for a different animal (e.g. poultry pellets); some pellets contain meat and this is poisonous to donkeys. Carrots—what ungulate (hoofed animal) doesn’t love a carrot? Set up a water trough or bucket and keep it full of fresh, unfrozen water at all times. Make sure it doesn't leak onto the floor of the donkey's shelter, since they need a completely dry floor for their hooves. Don’t forget to check in winter to see whether it has frozen over; if it has, you’ll need to clear the ice away, or equip the tank with a heater. Older donkeys will really appreciate a drink of warm water in the winter. Donkeys originated in a desert climate. They prefer warmer weather but are very hardy, provided they are given adequate accommodation. Donkeys do not like wind or rain and will seek shelter from both. Unlike horses, rain seeps into a donkey’s coat and makes life unbearable. The shelter doesn’t need to be elaborate, as long as it is adequate and provides the protection a donkey seeks. A shed, lean-to or barn with hard wooden floors is ideal. Make sure the floors are hard and dry. Donkeys have porous hooves that can become diseased when they stand in wet areas for too long.   In a temperate climate, provide a shelter which consists of a minimum of three walls, with adequate backspace to get out of the rain and wind. This might be a shed, a stable or even a small barn. Put straw on the ground for comfort and warmth, especially in the cooler months of the year. In a climate with severe winter (temperatures below freezing and featuring ice, snow and freezing gales), you must provide a donkey with barn accommodation. The barn should be snug; plug up any gaps that let draughts through to prevent the donkey from catching chills. A winter barn should also have adequate space for exercise, in case the donkey does not like being taken outside at all while snow rests on the ground.  To avoid possible contamination or worm problems, always keep a donkey’s feed area clean. Remove mud, wash food buckets daily and keep hay in a string basket attached to a wall (a hay-net), off the floor. Keep the shelter clean by mucking it out at least every other day to remove the donkey's waste and hay. Spray down the floor and walls and allow them to completely dry out before the donkey uses the shelter again.",
      "When you're picking out a donkey, it's important to take these factors into consideration. Male and female donkeys have different temperaments, and there are miniature, standard and giant-sized donkeys which are as big as standard horses. Figure out which type is the right fit for your needs before you decide which one to bring home.  If you plan to keep your donkey as a pet, choose a gelding (a castrated male) or a jenny (a female). If you plan to breed your donkey, you'll need a jack (an intact male) and one or more jennies. Don't get a jack if you just want a pet and don't keep a jack with other male donkeys, since they'll fight. If you plan to ride your donkey, make sure it's big enough to handle your weight. A donkey can safely carry 20% of its body weight. Also, just like mule, horse or camel, make sure they are not sick or injured, because this could make it worse If you plan to use your donkey as a guard animal against predators, such as wolves or dogs, choose a standard or giant donkey, not a miniature. It's important that the donkey be larger than the predator. If this is your first time handling a donkey, you'll want to choose one who already knows how to stand and walk on a lead without bolting. You may also want to make sure the donkey can handle being petted all over its body and will allow you to lift its feet without trouble. Donkeys can be a little tricky to train, so unless you're experienced with them, it's a good idea to choose one that is fairly well behaved or find a friend to help you. Donkeys are extremely social creatures and they get sad when they're left all alone in the pasture. Your donkey will be a lot happier with a companion. Two jennies, two geldings or a jenny and a gelding make good companions for each other. Donkeys will bond deeply with their companions for life, and they won't want to go anywhere without each other.   Donkeys can bond with horses but if you ever plan to take the horse somewhere without the donkey, it's not advisable to allow them to create a deep bond. The donkey will become upset when you remove the horse from the pasture. It's better to keep them in separate enclosures.  Donkey have very specific dietary needs, and if kept with other species are likely to become overweight and unwell. Donkeys and dogs don't make good companion animals unless they're raised together from the time they are babies. If using the donkey as a herd guardian, get only one so that it bonds to the herd rather than the other donkey. Donkeys should not be harshly punished. Practice gentleness and patience when you're trying to lead them or teach them something new. They aren't stubborn, but they need time to process situations before deciding what to do, and they dislike being hurried or forced to act. Pet your donkey, speak in soothing tones, and don't raise your voice or be forceful. In order to stay fit and healthy, they need daily exercise. They'll exercise themselves if they have a large enough pasture to roam around. You can also take your donkey for a walk using a long rope lead. Remember that it's not a good idea to ride your donkey unless it's large enough to support your weight.  Let your donkey get extra exercise in winter. If you have to shut your donkey up during winter, you will need to let it out every few days for exercise. If you can allow the donkey to wander around the barn in between outdoor outings, this would be ideal. Don’t force a donkey that hates snow to go out into the elements; provide this animal with an alternative indoor exercise area. Keep a coat on the donkey if you’d like during winter outings to prevent chills; donkeys can get pneumonia or bronchitis if subjected to rain or very cold weather.",
      "The best way to clean donkeys is to brush them every day. They don't like to get wet, so it's not necessary to spray them down or give them baths. A daily brushing, as well as cleaning the muck from their hooves, will suffice. Donkeys' hooves grow, just like people's nails, and they need to be trimmed from time to time so they don't get too long and crack. Have a professional farrier trim the donkey's hooves to the appropriate angle, which is 60 to 65 degrees. The donkey's hooves should be trimmed every 8 weeks or so. Donkeys' teeth also grow continuously, and they get worn down when the donkey chews food. Your donkey should be seen by an equine dentist every year regardless of how the teeth appear to you. Your donkeys teeth go back as far as the length of your forearm, so there is no way to know what is going on at the back of the mouth without specialist tools. The dentist will need to check right to the back of the mouth to make sure your donkey has functioning teeth that aren't causing difficulty eating and constant pain. A donkey with poor teeth may be happier on a diet of chaff or mash/wet feed – this will obviate the need for the donkey to chew too much on grass or hay. Consult with your vet as to the best options. Donkeys are hardy and almost disease-free. They do need to be vaccinated yearly against tetanus, flu and distemper. Other vaccinations to consider, depending on where you reside, include rabies, encephalitis, and West Nile Virus. Both horses and donkeys are beginning to suffer due to overzealous use of wormers in the past, as now the worms aren't responding as they used to and the drugs are becoming more and more inefficient. There is no easy answer to this, but the way forward is definitely not continuing on with the same pattern of untargeted worming that has caused the situation to arise. Donkeys and horses should be have their feces tested  four times a year to see what (if any) worms they have and then appropriate treatment can be given. Ask your vet to give you guidance on this, and also ask for a follow up check to make sure the treatment worked. Minimizing the number of larva that are eaten is a practical way to help combat the number of intestinal worms in your donkey. 'Poo picking' the grazing at least 3 times a week has been found to significantly reduce the number of worms on the pasture."

      "As you fall asleep, try to think of an image or concept that causes fear or anxiety. If you attempt this every night, you have a good chance of dreaming about the subject of your thoughts. You may be able to make your dreams or nightmares beneficial if you have a problem to solve that is causing you anxiety; your brain may continue to \"work on\" the problem while you sleep, possibly providing insight during a dream. While inducing a nightmare on a given night may be helped by moderate sleep disruption, repeating that day after day may greatly reduce the number of dreams you have. Stay well-rested, and you will spend more time in the deeper, restful REM period of sleep, in which most lengthy dreams occur. REM is short for Rapid Eye Movement, which describes the behavior of people sleeping during this period of sleep. Instead of getting up immediately, lie awake and try to remember or \"replay\" your dreams. If nothing comes to mind, try to examine your own emotions. If you wake up anxious or exhilarated, focusing on those feelings may help you remember a nightmare. Every human dreams each time they fall asleep for an extended period of time, but many of these dreams go unremembered. Try to write your dreams in a notebook by your bed as soon as you wake up, before you forget them, to help them stick in your memory. Write down any dreams you remember, not just your nightmares, as the habit may help you remember later dreams. . In a lucid dream, the dreamer is aware that she is dreaming. This often results in a more vivid or memorable dream, and sometimes, but not always, allows the dreamer to shape the course of events to some extent. While there are many ways to encourage lucid dreaming, you can start with two simple steps:  Focus on the concept of dreaming as you fall asleep, or about a particular topic to dream about. Choose the same topic each night for at least two weeks. Look for \"reality checks\" during the dream and your waking hours. Many people find that clocks or text in dreams can't be read clearly, or will look different each time. Try checking the time or reading a sign throughout the day as a \"dream check,\" and you may notice yourself doing the same thing to identify that you are dreaming.",
      "A study from Hong Kong Shue Yan University shows that people who sleep face down are more likely to have dreams about being tied up, smothered, and other nightmarish themes. Note that this may also increase the likelihood of erotic or sexual dreams, so you may not receive the desired effect. If you cannot get to sleep on your stomach, the next most \"nightmarish\" sleeping position may be lying on your back, followed by lying on your left side. While eating spicy, salty, or fatty foods are commonly believed to cause nightmares, scientists are divided over the exact effect of these substances. Some argue that the disruption of your sleep cycle may even slow down the onset of dreaming, potentially resulting in fewer dreams or nightmares. Others think they may increase dream intensity, at least in some people, and suggest that each person pay attention to his own body's response. Try watching a horror movie, playing a scary video game, or reading ghost stories before bed. If you have a specific fear or anxiety, look at images of it or simply lie in bed imagining a \"nightmare scenario.\" Aim to make yourself only slightly scared or anxious. If you are terrified out of your wits, you are unlikely to fall asleep in the first place. While the effect of vitamin B6 on dreams is not thoroughly studied, many people swear by its ability to increase the vividness of dreams. One study suggests that it may be effective, either due to an effect on the dreaming process itself, or an enhancement of your ability to remember dreams. Including vitamin B6 from both food and supplements, daily intake should not exceed 60 mg for children 9–13 years old; 80 mg for teenagers 14–18 years old; or 100 mg for adults 19 years or older. Some people report having more vivid or bizarre dreams when taking melatonin, which may give you a new dream experience even if they are not outright nightmares. At least one study supports this idea, suggesting that dreams involving transformations are especially likely to occur under melatonin. Melatonin is typically taken in doses of 1–20mg, and rarely causes health problems. However, due to interactions with other medications, possible negative effects during pregnancy, and the chance of an allergic reaction, you may wish to consult a doctor before taking melatonin. Caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine can all disrupt your sleep cycle. This can potentially cause nightmares if taken in small quantities. However, ingesting any of these substances in too large a quantity can disrupt your sleep too much. Reduce your intake of these substances if you have difficulty falling asleep in the first place, if you wake up repeatedly in the night, or if you feel tired after waking up. These are all signs that you may be getting less restful sleep, which may reduce the amount you dream. If you rarely or never consume these substances, the effect is likely to be more potent than you expect. It is not recommended that you begin taking these drugs solely to induce nightmares."

      "A click beetle, also known as Elateridae, can snap the front and back sections of its body together to make a clicking sound, and it can also use this motion to flip itself over if it gets stuck on its back. Click beetles are black or dark brown, and they have grooved sections running down their backs.  An adult click beetle may be between 0.5 to 1.5 in (1.3 to 3.8 cm) long. This beetle is common all over the world and there are over 900 species of click beetles in North America alone. Ground beetles are black with grooves on their backs, and they produce a strong odor. They usually hang out under logs and leaves, but they may wander into your house through a crack or open window. These beetles move quickly, so it might be hard to get a close look. Keep in mind that these beetle are harmless. They eat other insects, but will not bite you or your pets. These are called longhorn beetles because their antennae are reminiscent of longhorn cattle. The antennae may be straight, curved, or half and half.  Longhorn beetle coloring can range from black, brown, green, yellow, red, or a combination of these colors. There are 413 species of longhorn beetles in Texas alone, but they all share the distinguishing feature of long antennae. If the beetle has a rounded head with a scoop neck shape around the base of it, then it is most likely a mealworm. Despite the name, these are actually beetles. Mealworms usually live outdoors, but you may find them infesting containers of flour and other dried grains. Keep your grains in air-tight containers to prevent an infestation. If you look closely at an oldhouse borer, you may notice small gray hairs on its back. You may also be able to make out 3 dark eyes on each side of the beetle’s mouth. These beetles usually turn up in a house about 4 to 7 years after it has been built.",
      "Beetles have wings, but they are covered by 2 hard wing coverings. This is what gives a beetle its distinctive hard-shelled look. The hardened wing coverings on a beetle’s back are also the reason why a beetle will make a crunching sound if you accidentally step on one. If the insect is a beetle, its wings should not be visible unless the coverings are lifted up and the wings are extended. Beetles have sharp mandibles (chewing mouthparts) so they can consume other insects, plant matter, fungus, and decaying plants and animals. Look at the underside of the insect’s mouth to see if they have sharp-looking mouthparts. If the insect has a long, straw-like protrusion, then it is not a beetle. Beetles have 6 legs distributed between their front and back body segments. When they are in their larval stage, the legs are all on the front of a beetle’s body. Otherwise, the legs are spread between the front and back  segments. Count the insect’s legs and check their location to determine if it is a beetle. If the insect has 4 legs, 8 legs, or more, then it is not a beetle.",
      "This is most likely a black carpet beetle. These beetles are usually black or very dark brown and their bodies are oval shaped. They range in size from 0.12 to 0.19 inches (0.30 to 0.48 cm). Varied color carpet beetles are similar to black carpet beetles. These are very small (0.12 in (0.30 cm)) beetles with bright yellow and green markings. These beetles are 0.25 in (0.64 cm) long. They feed on tree leaves, especially on elm tree leaves, and they lay their eggs on the undersides of leaves as well. Elm leaf beetles can damage trees if they get out of control, so you may need to manage them with pesticides. These are also known as lady beetles and in some countries, ladybirds. Their bodies may be yellow, orange, or red with black markings, but they can also be black with red, orange, or yellow markings. There are over 450 species of lady beetles in North America alone. Larder beetles are black beetles that are known to infest cured ham. They have a whitish, silver streak running across their back and they are oval-shaped. Be sure to keep ham covered when it is out, and put it in the refrigerator to store it. Bark beetles are only about 0.12 in (0.30 cm) and they are common around piles of firewood. Bark beetles may also infest live trees, which may die as a result of a bark beetle infestation. Bark beetle infestations create dry, dead wood, which intensifies forest fires. The coloring of these beetles may range from brown to reddish brown, and they are around 0.1 to 0.14 in (0.25 to 0.36 cm) long. These beetles infest packaged food. If the head is so far bent over that the beetle has a hump, then it is likely a cigarette beetle. These are almost identical to drugstore beetles but they appear to be hunchbacked. These are also known confused flour beetles. These beetles feed on corn flour and other packaged products. Make sure to keep your corn flour and other flours in air-tight containers to protect them from these pests. Weevils are only about 0.12 in (0.30 cm) and brown with a pointed head that resembles a beak. Their bodies are long and slender. Weevil infestations in rice and other grains are common. These pests can chew right through paper and plastic, so it is best to keep any loose grains and flour in air-tight glass, metal, or hard plastic containers. These beetles are only about 0.12 in (0.30 cm) long. Their favorite foods to infest and eat are sunflower seeds and nuts, but they can also infest large quantities of grains. Sawtoothed grain beetles are more likely to get into the food supply if the bins are not sanitized at least every 6 months."

      "Don’t wait until your car battery is dead and needs to be replaced to buy a new one.  Consult your automobile’s maintenance guide or check online to find out how often you should replace your battery.  Adhere to the maintenance guide’s recommendations and change your battery as needed. At least once each year, visit your local mechanic.  Have them check the battery to ensure it is still operating properly.  If it is not, replace it with a new battery. These annual visits should begin after your vehicle is two years old if you live in a warm climate, or after your vehicle is four years old if you live in a colder climate. After buying a new car battery, you’ll need to discard your old one.  Don’t just throw it in the bin, though.  Contact your local auto garage and find out if they accept old batteries.  If they don’t ask, for information regarding how to dispose of your battery responsibly.",
      "Different cars require different amounts of power and differently sized batteries.  Check your vehicle’s maintenance guide for information regarding what sort of batter your vehicle requires.  If you no longer have the maintenance guide, take your car to a mechanic for assistance in identifying the type of battery your vehicle needs. Additionally, buy a battery appropriate for your local climate.  Hot-weather batteries are often labeled “S” or “South.”  Cold-weather batteries might be labeled “N” or “North.”  If you drive off-road, you might want to invest in an battery that is better able to endure constant vibrations. Maintenance-free batteries are sealed and require no special attention.  Most car batteries are maintenance-free, but some require periodic filling with water.  Whenever possible, save yourself future hassle by purchasing a maintenance-free battery. Car batteries are tested by consumer organizations and auto enthusiasts.  Check a consumer reporting site or auto blog based in your nation for information about the types of car batteries sold there. Batteries should be rated based on their longevity and power. Even when stored, batteries can lose strength.  Always buy a new battery that was produced within the last six months. Some car batteries have dates labeled on them in an easy-to-understand way.  Others, however, will have a date in a kind of code, in which A stands for January, B stands for February, and so on.  (The letter “I” is excluded in such a system.)",
      "You could buy online, or you could shop at a physical auto parts store.  Since shipping a battery can be prohibitively expensive, your best bet is to buy a battery at a physical store.  Doing so will also make it easier to make a return, if necessary.  Plus, buying a battery at an store often includes free installation. Compare the price of car batteries sold at different shops.  If possible, browse prices online or call the shop to find out how much they charge for the type of batteries you need.  Doing so will save you time and effort. Before leaving the auto store, be sure that the battery you’ve purchased is the right one for your car.  Auto shop employees should be able to look up the make and model of your car to determine if you’re buying the right battery."

      "Apply a small, quarter-sized amount of shampoo to your palms and work it into a lather. Then, apply the shampoo to your scalp and massage vigorously with your fingertips. Then, work the lather through your hair and rinse. Rinse hair thoroughly so no shampoo is left behind. Washing your hair should take about five minutes. Even though greasy hair looks and feels dirty, washing your hair every day will make your hair more greasy because shampoo strips hair of its nutrients and natural oils, causing your scalp to produce even more oil. Wash your hair every 2-3 days at the very most. This gives your hair enough time to replace the natural oils, so you're not producing an excess. If you usually shampoo your hair every day, it may take a few months for your scalp to stop overproducing oil after you change your shampoo habits. Use dry shampoo on the days you don't wash your scalp to help absorb excess oil as you transition. In addition to not shampooing every day, use a high-quality, gentle cleansing shampoo. Shampoos that are aggressive tend to irritate hair follicles, causing the scalp to produce more oil.  Common irritants include sulfates like sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, as well as silicones like dimethicone and cyclomethicone. You can find silicone and sulfate-free hair products in most drug stores, as well as specialty beauty and hair-care stores. Shampoos with salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or ketoconazole are good for greasy hair. Salicylic acid helps reduce oil on the scalp. Oily hair does not need to be conditioned often. Condition every other time you wash or just once a week. Only use conditioner on the tips of your hair instead of the roots, where grease gathers more easily. Apply it by squeezing your conditioner into your palms and scrunching it into the ends of your hair. The best dry shampoos for greasy hair come in a powder form. Try not to use liquid dry shampoos. Massage the dry shampoo powder in your hair and on your scalp between washes to soak up grease and leave hair smelling fresh, but don’t use them more than once a day. It can be difficult to resist washing your hair after working out, but when your hair is wet with sweat, you do not need to wash it to feel clean again. Just rinse your hair in the shower to remove the salts from your sweat and use a bit of conditioner on your ends to detangle if necessary. If you don't have access to a shower, you can also use a spray bottle to wet your hair and blow-dry it instead of washing. Many hair products have silicone in them, which causes hair to be heavy and greasy. Try using fewer hair styling products in general. If you must use products, avoid ones with silicone. After one month, your hair should be less greasy from adjusting your shampooing methods. If changing your habits does not help at all, try seeing a dermatologist, who will most likely prescribe you shampoo or medication to reduce oil.",
      "Apple cider vinegar helps balance the pH level of your scalp. To use this method, mix 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar in one cup of water. After washing your hair, pour the apple cider vinegar and water mix over your hair, and rinse out after 3-5 minutes.  Rinse with cold water. You can do this up to 3 times a week. Squeeze the juice from two lemons, and mix with two cups of water. Massage the lemon and water mixture on your hair for 3-5 minutes, then rinse your hair with warm water. Repeat 3 times a week. Keep in mind that this could cause your hair to become lighter. Mix 1 teaspoon of aloe vera gel, one tablespoon of lemon juice, and one cup of your shampoo. Wash your hair with the mixture, allowing the shampoo to sit for 3 minutes. Then, rinse with warm water.  Repeat this method up to a few times a week. If you don’t use the whole shampoo mixture, store it in the fridge for up to a week. Mix one part baking soda in three parts water to make a paste for your hair. Longer hair will require more paste. Rub the paste into damp hair and leave it on for 5 minutes. Then, wash your hair with warm water. Repeat this method twice a week."

      "If you address the other person directly, your email stands out more. You can do this by mentioning the person’s name or by using the words “you” and “your.” These words are direct, conversational, and encourage the recipient to open the email.  For example, start the subject line with a phrase like “Hey Bill!” or “Did you call yet?” If you don’t know the person’s name, you can reference a personal detail like the recipient’s location. For instance, say, “Best restaurants in your city.” It’s important to relay urgency as soon as possible. Encourage the reader to click on the email by including a call to action or a reference to scarcity. These tactics suggest that the reader needs to act right away to benefit from the email.  For instance, use words and phrases like “Hurry!” or “24 hours left” to call the reader to act now. Hint that something is limited, such as by saying, “This item is flying off the shelves.” Follow up the urgent word with a clear picture of what the reader should expect inside the email. Use action-oriented words to suggest how the reader should respond. Make sure you keep the subject line clear and concise so the title isn’t confusing.  For example, you can say something like, “Hurry! It’s a sale.” You can also explain the email through numbers. For instance, say, “5 ways to reduce your electric bill.” A question can be a great way of hinting at what is inside your email. The question has to be relevant to the reader. It should reference an urgent event or a subject the reader needs to know, encouraging them to read the email right away.  For example, you can say something like, “Last chance - have you ordered your tickets yet?” Another example is, “How can you be more productive today?\"",
      "In the text, explain why you are sending the email. Show the reader what makes this email urgent and why they should respond to it as soon as possible. Be as specific as possible to suggest what the other person gets out of reading your email.  For example, you can say something like, “Tired of walking around on worn-out shoes? Our sale has brand-name shoes at rock-bottom prices.” You might write, “Call the client today to get in under the deadline.” Avoid making an urgent email long and confusing. Limit yourself to a couple of short sentences or paragraphs. Relay your message in a way that is easy to understand and grammatically correct.  To avoid making your message too long, try making a list of the most important points you need to make. Many businesses include an image in the email. A sales ad explains the email’s purpose efficiently. By trying to sound urgent, you may come off as pushy or intimidating. Avoid demanding that the reader pays attention and responds, since this backfires more often than not. Instead, pair time-related words with suggestions of actions the reader should take.  For example, say, “There are 5 spots left on the plane. Please call today to reserve your seat.” To avoid sounding intimidating, be a little indirect. For instance, say, “Identity theft increases by 5% every year, making it more important than ever to protect your personal information.” Use the last sentence of your email to guide the reader towards the action you want them to take. This needs to be specific, so include any information they need to respond to your email. This could be a button to press, a website link, or a phone number.  For instance, if you want someone to make a call, say, \"Please call me today” and follow up with your phone number. Provide the exact website link. If you want a person to see a specific product, post the link to the product page, not the overall website. If you wish to direct someone to a physical location, it helps to provide directions, maps, and other references.",
      "A lot of people see the email address first, and if it isn’t recognizable, they may skip the email. Make sure your email address suggests what the other person can expect to see in the email. Personalize your email address to make your email more visible.  For example, use your name. The email should look something like, “John Smith, wikiHow” or “johnsmith@wikihow.com.” Avoid using random numbers and symbols, since this isn’t professional and makes your email look like spam. To sound urgent, give off the impression that the reader needs to act now. Even if you do not have a specific deadline, pretend that there is one. Make sure you reference this deadline as often as possible throughout the email.  For example, you can say, “This deal ends tomorrow.” If you don’t have a specific deadline, try saying, “Please respond by Tuesday” or “I’d appreciate it if you responded by 5:00 PM.” All of the information in the email should relate to your purpose for sending it. This purpose is what needs to be emphasized in the subject line and throughout the text. Every detail needs to lead into that purpose, telling the reader what they need to know to act upon it. Edit out any details that do not fit, since they detract from the urgent tone.  If you are selling a product, you would include the product’s features and biggest benefits. Long stories or small details may be distracting. For instance, if you are reaching out to a customer, you might want to tell them, “Save 20% when you shop at my new website.” Think of what the person needs to know. If you have already contacted someone, you do not need to repeat what you said before. Good typing techniques and grammatical sense make your email so much easier to understand. Avoid using lots of exclamation marks or unnecessary capital letters. Use proper language and be respectful.  Avoid shorthand words like “u,” “ur,” “plz,” and emojis. Lots of exclamation marks, capital letters, or numbers can also trigger a spam filter, meaning your email may not get seen at all."

The \"sudo\" part of the command sets up the rest of the command for \"root privilege\", which allows you to view sensitive system information. The \"discoveryutil\" part of the command request the DNS information from your system. The \"udnscachestats\" part of the command displays one of two sections of your DNS cache. This should be the password you use to log in. Press ⏎ Return when you finish typing. Terminal should display your Unicast DNS cache.  The Unicast DNS (UDNS) cache translates website addresses (such as Facebook) into IP addresses for your computer to use during future searches. With Unicast, your address sends out one IP address request to one server per site, regardless of how many servers exist. If that server becomes unresponsive, you will encounter a DNS error. You can use the results of your search to view the IP addresses of frequently-visited sites. If you encountered a DNS error, the UDNS cache is the most likely location of the problem. You can also use the UDNS cache to check your recent site history. You will need to check the Multicast DNS cache as well for a complete report. This will help you avoid command errors when checking the next section of your DNS cache. Don't include the quotation marks. Press ⏎ Return when you're done.

This should be the password you use to log in. Press ⏎ Return when you finish typing. Terminal should display your Multicast DNS cache.  The Multicast DNS (MDNS) cache also translates website addresses (such as Facebook) into IP addresses for your computer to use during future searches. With Multicast, your address sends out multiple IP address requests to multiple servers per site. If one server becomes unresponsive, you still have multiple connections to other servers, meaning you're much less likely to encounter a DNS error on a Multicast network than on a Unicast network. You can use the results of your search to view the IP addresses of frequently-visited sites. You can also use the MDNS cache to check your recent site history. Checking the MDNS cache in conjunction with the UDNS cache will give you a full history report. Type \"sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; say cache flushed\" into Terminal. Hit ⏎ Return to finalize the flush. This will reset your saved website data and clear any DNS errors you may encounter. This command is appropriate for the the latest version of OS X (10.11).  This command flushes both cache sections (UDNS and MDNS). Flushing both sections resolves any current errors and prevents future errors from occurring, so you should always flush both for consistency. Flushing the cache will not harm your computer. The Terminal commands to flush the DNS cache vary between OS X versions. Find out what version you are running by going to the Apple menu and selecting \"About This Mac\". For OS X 10.10.4 and up type \"sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder; say cache flushed\". For OS X 10.10 to 10.10.3 users should type \"sudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache; sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches; say flushed\". For OS X 10.7 to 10.9 type \"sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\". For OS X 10.5 to 10.6 type \"sudo dscacheutil -flushcache\" For OS X 10.3 to 10.4 type \"lookupd -flushcache\". Use your browser of choice to visit a site on which you encountered a DNS error.

      "and let the students see it. A rubric is used to assign numerical values to various criteria used to make up the letter grade, usually based on a scale of 100. To get a letter grade, you assign numerical values to each section and tally the score. Making the students aware of the rubric used will keep the process transparent and eliminate the idea that you pull arbitrary grades out of nowhere. A rubric, for example, might look like this:  Thesis and argument: _/40 Organization and paragraphs: _/30 Introduction and conclusion: _/10 Grammar, usage, and spelling: _/10 Sources and Citations: _/10 Let the students see a description of what an A means, what a B means, etc. Write your own according to your own specific criteria and emphasis for the class. Share it with the students so they can interpret the grade they receive. These are fairly standard designations, often worded like this:  A (100-90): Work completes all of the requirements of the assignment in an original and creative manner. Work at this level goes beyond the basic guidelines of the assignment, showing the student took extra initiative in originally and creatively forming content, organization, and style. B (89-80): Work completes all of the requirements of the assignment. Work at this level is successful in terms of content, but might need some improvement in organization and style, perhaps requiring a little revision. A B reveals less of the author’s original thought and creativity than A-level work. C (79-70): Work completes most of the requirements of the assignment. Though the content, organization, and style are logical and coherent, they may require some revision and may not reflect a high level of originality and creativity on the part of the author. D (69-60): Work either does not complete the requirements of the assignment, or meets them quite inadequately. Work at this level requires a good deal of revision, and is largely unsuccessful in content, organization, and style. F (Below 60): Work does not complete the requirements of the assignment. In general, students who put forth genuine effort will not receive an F. If you receive an F on any assignment (particularly if you feel you have given adequate effort), you should speak with me personally. Put the grade at the very end of the paper, after they've seen the rubric and your comments. Slapping a big letter grade at the top near the title will ensure that the student probably won't go through and read all the smart and helpful comments you've included. Some teachers like to hand out papers at the end of the day because they fear discouraging or distracting students during class time. Consider giving the students time to go through the papers in class and be available to talk about their grades afterwards. This will ensure that they read and understand your comments.",
      "The goal of comments is to point out the strengths and weaknesses in a student's writing and to offer them concrete strategies toward improving their work. Completely shredding apart a failed paragraph with your red pen does not accomplish any of these aims.  Use marginal comments to point out specific points or areas in the essay the student could improve. Use a paragraph note at the end to summarize your comments and direct them toward improvement. Comments should not justify a letter grade. Never start a note, \"You got a C because...\". It's not your job to defend the grade given. Instead, use the comments to look toward revision and the next assignment, rather than staring backward at the successes or failures of the given assignment. Try to start your comments by finding something the student has done well and encouraging them. Seeing exclamation points or \"Good job\" on an essay tends to be more memorable for the student, and will ensure that they'll repeat the behavior. If you struggle to find anything, you can always praise their topic selection: \"This is an important topic! Good choice!\" Even if your student has written a disaster of a paper, don't overwhelm them with every single thing that needs to be fixed. Try to focus on no more than three main areas of improvement in your comments. This will give the student concrete strategies toward improvement, and avoid overwhelming them with \"failures.\" When you give your first read-through, Try to determine what these three points might be to make it easier when you're going through the paper and writing comments. Instead of focusing your comments on everything the student did wrong in an essay, direct your comments toward the next essay, or toward a re-write of the current essay, if that fits in with the conventions of the assignment. \"In your next assignment, make sure to organize your paragraphs according to the argument you're making\" is a better comment than \"Your paragraphs are disorganized.\"",
      "Sometimes called \"higher\" and \"lower\" concerns, it's important to prioritize major issues like content, creative thinking, and organization over more minor issues like grammar, usage, and spelling. These designations obviously depend upon many things, like the assignment, the grade-level of your students, and their individual concerns. If you're in the middle of a unit on comma usage, it's perfectly fine to call that a \"higher\" concern. But in general, a basic writing assignment should prioritize the higher concerns listed above. When you've got a stack of 50 or 100 papers to go through and another stack of quizzes to finish and lessons to plan it can be tempting to jump right in and start slapping Bs on everything. Resist that temptation. Read through each essay individually before marking anything. Look for the highest order of concerns first:  Does the student address the prompt and fulfill the assignment effectively? Does the student think creatively? Does the student clearly state their argument, or thesis? Is the thesis developed over the course of the assignment? Does the writer provide evidence? Does the paper show evidence of organization and revision, or does it seem like a first draft? Getting an assignment back that looks like someone bled all over it can be a source of great anxiety in the life of a student. Some teachers argue that red asserts authority. While that may be true, there are other ways to assert your authority than pen color. Marking essays in pencil can suggest that the issues are easily fixable, keeping the student looking forward, rather than dwelling on their success or failure. Pencil, blue, or black pen is perfectly appropriate. Write comments, criticisms, and questions in the margins as neatly as possible. Find moments that the writer needs to clarify and circle them or underline them. Be as specific as possible when asking questions. \"What?\" is not a particularly helpful question to scrawl in the margin, compared to \"What do you mean by 'some societies'?\" When you've addressed the most important issues of the essay, its content, feel free to mark some lower-order concerns, like usage, grammar, and punctuation. Depending on the grade-level of the essays and the skill-level of your students, these may be more or less important. Typical proofreading marks include the following:  ¶ = to start a new paragraph three underscores under a letter = to lowercase or uppercase the letter \"sp\" = word is spelled incorrectly word crossed out with a small \"pigtail\" above = word needs to be deleted Some teachers use the first page as a rule of thumb for marking later concerns. If there are sentence-level issues, mark them on the first page and then stop marking them throughout the essay, especially if the assignment needs more revision."

      "Picking Your Urinal",
      "Peeing"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Some public restrooms have privacy guards between urinals. These guards serve the dual purpose of providing you privacy, and shielding you from other people’s splash back. Try to find a restroom that comes equipped with privacy guards, as you’ll be much less likely to fall victim to someone else’s splash back. If you can’t find a restroom with privacy guards, pick a urinal on the end, next to the stalls or the sink, instead of a middle urinal. This way, you’ll be half as likely to fall victim to the splash back generated by the guy next to you. Studies have shown that the closer you are to someone else, the more anxiety and difficulty you and that other person will have when it comes to peeing. The resulting panic and anxiety that you both experience might just lead you or your neighbor to create splash back. It is generally considered okay to stand and pee directly next to another person (men next to men or boys next to boys) when the restroom is crowded and there is no alternative urinal available. Many times the floor in front of the urinal will be wet – that’s other people’s urine. Be aware as you approach the urinal, you don’t want to step in someone else’s puddle and unwittingly splash urine onto yourself that way. Sometimes we’ve really got to go, and we rush up to the urinal and get peeing in a hurry. Try not to do this. You need to think before you pee so that you’ll be able to take steps and precautions that will limit your splash back.",
      "Urinal cakes are designed to fight odor and are often small and placed on the bottom of the urinal. They're not meant to be targets. If you hit them, they might create splash back and deflect urine spray in your direction. Change the angle of your stream. Don't hit the urinal dead on. The splash back will be worse the closer it is to 90 degrees. Instead, try to hit the urinal at a soft angle -- less than 45 degrees. Some urinal inserts and splash guards are designed to absorb the impact of your urine stream to reduce potential splash back. Shoot for these, especially if you can pee on one that bends upward so that it is vertical and so you can hit it at less than 45 degrees. Splash back is greatly increased when your urine hits a surface at a sharp angle and from a great distance. After a few inches, your urine starts to break up into droplets. These droplets create more splash back than a solid stream of urine.  Distance matters because your stream will start to break up if you are too far, and you will have a higher chance of creating splash back. In addition, your urine picks up a lot of velocity the farther you stand from the urinal, resulting in more splash back. If you can impact that porcelain before stream breakup occurs, you will be in good shape. While you may not want to be too close, you definitely don't want to be standing too far away. Generally, your stream will begin to lose coherence and power after about six inches from your urethra, so take this into account when you pee. Remember though, there is no \"magic\" number when it comes to how far to stand from a urinal, because each urinal is different, every person is different, and everyone's comfort level is different. When you’re done, don’t shake too quickly. This might cause your urine to fly through the air or it might hit the urinal and you could create splash back by accident."

      "You’ll not survive becoming poor if you take sick.  Not only will you be sick, but you may have to take work off, further compounding your strained financial situation.  Stave off illness and maintain a strong immune system by eating nutritious, balanced meals each day.  A good diet consists mostly of grains, fruits, and vegetables.  A modest amount of protein should also be included, though it’s not necessary to do so at every meal. There are plenty of healthy meal options you can try on a budget.  Check out the US Department of Agriculture’s menus and cookbooks online at http://www.choosemyplate.gov/budget-sample-two-week-menus. Being with people who care for you will help you realize that even though you’re poor, you’re still a wonderful, rational person whose life has value.  Make time for family and friends who affirm that you are important and make you feel good. Strong social support systems will build psychic resilience.  In the face of adversity, including poverty, you will be less likely to feel anxious, worried, or depressed when you know you have friends and family you can rely on. When you’re poor, it can be hard to see anything outside your immediate circumstances.  You’re focused on paying the rent, the electric bill, the car insurance, and so on.  The constant threat that one of these costs will push you further into financial ruin can distract you from planning for tomorrow.  No matter how bad things seem, there’s always a new day tomorrow.  Focusing on and planning for better days ahead can relieve stress and distract you from whatever problems you’re facing today.  Don’t worry about what-ifs.  Focusing on things you did wrong or dwelling on the past will not help you change your current predicament. Envision yourself in 5, 10, and 15 years.  Where do you imagine you’ll be living?  What kind of work will you do?  Share your thoughts with a friend and invite them to do the same. Try to find something positive in each week or day that you can look forward to.  Try to make it something different each day (don’t just think about how desperately you want to get out of work every day).  Things like meeting a friend for a bike ride, or taking your child to the playground might be some of the things you look forward to after each day. People living in poverty often rate themselves low on scales of self-efficacy, their own beliefs about what they can and cannot do.  Accept the things that you cannot change.  You’ve become poor, but hey, it’s not the end of the world!  Recognize that your situation is temporary and you’ll come out of it better and stronger. Challenge negative thoughts.  When you feel a thought such as “I’m no good” or “I’ll always be poor,” do not dwell on it.  Introduce a contrary thought such as “I am a good person and many people like being around me” or “Someday I will be financially independent.” Forgive yourself.  You’re a fallible person, just like everyone else.  Your mistakes do not define you, they are only bumps in your personal life path.  Use positive self-talk to forgive yourself.  Say to yourself “I made a mistake but I am still a good person.” In poverty, people find it more difficult to exercise self-control.  You’re often in situations where you need help -- financial and material -- immediately.  Think about occasions where you did not exercise proper self-control.  You might have felt tempted to engage in habits like drinking or binge-eating which release endorphins and make you feel good.  You might have lost your temper more than you did before you were struggling with poverty.  Whatever the case, try to become conscious of occasions where you lose control and take positive steps to reign yourself in. Try to find positive outlets for your energy.  When you feel that you might blow up on someone or want to have a drink, go for a run or bike ride instead.  Try painting a picture or playing a musical instrument. Get enough rest.  A full night’s sleep -- 6 to 8 hours -- is important for thinking clearly and deliberately.  You’ll be more able to exercise self-control when you are well-rested.  Set a regular bed time and stick to it each night.",
      "A food bank is an organization run by a church, homeless shelter, or community aid organization which offers food to those in need. Community dinners are often offered at local churches and community aid organizations for free or at extremely low cost.  Call local churches to find out if they have weekly spaghetti dinners, soup kitchens, or other events where meals are provided to the general public. SNAP provides nutrition assistance to low-income individuals and families.  The program is provided by the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service, and funded publicly.  To qualify for SNAP, you can have up to $2,250 in total household bank accounts, or $3,250 if you’re 60 or older.  Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and most retirement plans do not count against the total financial resources used to determine whether you qualify.  The amount of income you earn also determines eligibility.  To apply, find your state’s public assistance office.  A full list of such offices and the online SNAP applications of states which offer them are available at http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/apply.  Fill in the required paperwork and mail, digitally submit, or print your application.  Response times vary by state.  You might also try identifying and calling your local SNAP hotline with this list: http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-informationhotline-numbers. SNAP benefits can be used for food purchases only.  Pet foods, soaps, household supplies, vitamins and medicines, alcohol, and hot foods (take-out or deli pizzas, for example) cannot be purchased with SNAP benefits. CSFP is a nutritional assistance program designed to improve healthy eating in low-income elderly people by providing them with healthy foods.  The program is administered by the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service and is similar to other nutritional assistance programs like WIC and SNAP.  To sign up for CSFP, contact your local human resources office.  Search the USDA’s database for a CSFP provider at http://www.fns.usda.gov/fdd/food-distribution-contacts. If you are  a low-income mother, you may be eligible for WIC benefits.  The program is publicly funded and administered through the US Department of Agriculture to provide food for poor mothers and their children.  Foods given to qualifying individuals as part of WIC packages include juice, milk, breakfast cereal, cheese, eggs, fruits and vegetables, whole wheat bread, canned fish, peanut butter, and legumes.  To apply for WIC, contact your local state or county public assistance office. Public housing is a comprehensive suite of three rental assistance programs, plus Section 8 vouchers, designed to give low-income individuals more affordable housing options.  The programs are run by local agencies but overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  Most tenants in public housing pay around just 30% of their income to subsidize their rent.  Limiting your housing costs in this way is an important step toward surviving poverty.  To qualify for public housing, you must earn 80% or less of the average local income. Contact your local HUD office or search for publicly subsidized housing on HUD’s site at http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/rental_assistance to learn how you can apply for public housing in your state or municipality.",
      "Do not invest your money in banks.  Credit unions tend to have lower fees, higher savings rates, and lower loan rates than banks, which cater more toward businesses.  Credit unions are also more likely to have lower minimum account balance requirements than banks. These places offer you your cash instantly, but take a percentage out of your total check.  This will leave you with significantly less income over time.  For instance, assume you cash a $100 check each week, and the check cashing service takes 5% of the check.  It doesn’t seem like much, but it adds up quickly.  At that rate, it translates to five dollars each week; by year’s end, that’s $260. Overdrawn accounts are more likely to happen when you are financially on the edge.  This leads to late fees and charges.  Ending automatic debit for utilities, rent, and other regular costs might take more time out of your schedule each month, but you will have financial control returned to you. This can be a challenge when you’re living on a fixed or limited income, but there are positive steps you can take to reduce your financial risks.  Don’t take out new credit cards; work instead on paying off the balance on your current credit cards and loans.  Draw up a household budget.  In one column, calculate your household’s total income.  This includes revenue coming in not only from you, but from everyone in your house.  Then calculate your household’s total expenses.  Think about the costs accumulated by children and pets as well as by you and any other adults in the house.  Subtract the expenses from the income total.  If the expenses exceed the income, try to find where you can cut some expenses, or figure a way to increase your income streams. Before buying anything, always ask yourself this question: \"Is this really necessary?\"  If not, put it back on the shelf for another day when you are not so poor. Full-time jobs are exceedingly rare.  You’ll likely have to cobble together a work schedule consisting of multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet.  While it can be inconvenient to juggle two or even three work schedules, such an arrangement will ensure you always have some source of income.  If one job fails to provide an adequate amount of hours in a given week or month, you’ll already have your other job(s) to fall back on.  Don’t be afraid to request working more hours if you think you can take them on.  Employers like seeing helpful employees who are eager to work. If you have trouble finding additional time in your schedule to work due to the presence of small children, ask a trusted relative or neighbor to tend to them while you go to work. If you have a hard time locating transportation to get to or from a place of work, ask coworkers, friends, or family to give you a ride.  Check local public transit options as well. If it is impossible to take on extra work, ask for a raise at your current place of employment.  You are more likely to get a raise if you’ve been on the job for at least a year. If the restaurant you work at pays 10 bucks an hour and the restaurant up the street pays 11 bucks an hour, you should think about jumping ship.  Don’t feel bad about leaving a job.  It’s nothing personal, you’re just looking out for your own economic interests. If you are in debt, you might consider speaking with a debt counselor.  Debt counselors can help you consolidate your debt or construct a repayment plan to get your debt under control.  You could also seek assistance from a financial advisor, a specially trained economic expert who helps individuals utilize and save their money in the most efficient way possible.  Financial advisors can educate and train you on how to budget your money.  They are often available over the phone or online, as well as in person. Be on the lookout for credit counseling scams.  Some organizations purport to be debt counseling agencies but are in fact in the business of preying on economically vulnerable individuals, and charge lots of fees  Do not allow any agency to add you as an authorized user on another bank account, or obtain an Employer Identification Number for you.",
      "Almost anything can be repaired -- cobblers, hardware stores, and electronics repair shops are all available for hire.  For instance, instead of investing in a whole new couch, have it reupholstered.  Instead of buying a new TV, take it to the repair shop to extend its life or replace broken parts.  If a new household purchase is unavoidable, save money slowly over time in order to purchase the item you need. Avoid rent-to-own options.  Rent-to-own furniture or electronic equipment is a tempting offer because you can pay in small installments over a long period.  But in the long run, it will cost you more than if you had just paid the whole amount all at once. Check supermarket flyers, factory outlets, and thrift stores to help you save.  Try to find stores that offer price-matching sales so that you can save time by bringing in competitors’ ads instead of hoofing it all over to the stores which offer the best deals. Compare prices carefully.  Many stores provide direct price comparisons if you look closely on shelf tags in the grocery store.  For instance, price-per-unit shelf tags might indicate that one brand of juice might cost $1 per liter, while another might cost $1.20 per liter.  Whenever possible, opt for the less expensive choice. Buying in bulk means you pay by the pound for one large bag of something rather than buying several smaller pre-measured packages of the same foodstuff.  Doing this will lower your grocery costs.  Since grocers can move more product this way, you’ll get a lower rate per pound.  For instance, instead of buying three two-pound bags of rice for $2 each, you might buy a seven pound bag for $5, and end up with more food for less money.  Ethnic grocers are good places to stock up on staples like rice, beans, and vegetables in bulk. Economy size indicates a product you’ll pay less per unit of measure for when buying more of it.  For example, many grocery stores offer a one pound box of cereal for $3 per pound, or a somewhat larger two pound box of the same cereal for only $2.50 per pound.  This nominal difference will save you more in the long run.  Even though the total cost of the somewhat larger box is more expensive ($5 as compared to $3 for the smaller box), you’re getting more cereal for your money. Shop consciously when you go to the grocery store (or any store, really).  This way, you’ll have a kind of roadmap when you’re visiting the grocery store, and won’t just wander all over the store looking at (and possibly buying) things you don’t really need.  Obtain the items on your shopping list, head to checkout, and leave. Look for more spartan shops.  Part of what you pay for when you visit a grocery store is the experience.  An upscale place like Whole Foods is not the best place to shop if you’re trying to survive being poor."

      "Tiny needles are penetrating your skin, so obviously you want to disinfect those needles first. Soak the roller in 70% isopropyl alcohol. Leave it for 10 minutes.  70% is better than 99% because it doesn't evaporate as quickly. After it's soaked for 10 minutes, pull it out, and shake off the excess alcohol. Let it air dry for a few minutes. It's important to start with clean skin. For example, you could use a gentle foaming cleanser for your face to thoroughly clean your skin. Bar soap or shower gel and water for other parts of your body are fine. The point is you need to start with clean skin, and it's fine to use your typical cleansers. However, you don't want to start with anything too harsh, so skip facial cleansers with things like salicyclic acid in them. Opt for something gentler. Longer needles mean deeper penetration, which in turn can lead to infection. If you're using needles longer than 0.5 millimeters long, you should disinfect your skin in addition to the roller. Gently swipe rubbing alcohol (70% isopropyl) all across your skin.",
      "Most people aren't sensitive to the needles, but if you're sensitive to pain, you can use a numbing cream first, particularly if you have needles that are 1.0 millimeter or longer. Rub a lidocaine cream into the area, and leave it for 20 minutes before you start rolling. Wipe off any excess cream before you roll. Start on one edge of the area. Roll up it from top to bottom, avoiding the eye socket area if you're doing your face. Lift it up, and roll over the same area again, repeating 6 times in total. Move the roller over and repeat. Keep going until you've done the whole area. If you're using longer needles, such as 1.0 millimeter or higher, you may see some light bleeding. However, if you notice more than pinpricks of blood, you should stop. You may need a smaller needle. Starting at the top or bottom, roll across the area horizontally. Lift up, and roll over the same area again. Roll over it 6 times altogether. Move down or up a little bit, and repeat the process until you've done the whole area. You can also go diagonally, but that can lead to uneven needling. You can overdo it with microneedling, especially on your face. Therefore, it's a good idea to limit each rolling session to under 2 minutes if you can. Using it too often can lead to inflammation. At most, try using your derma roller 3 to 5 times a week, making sure to give your skin a break every now and then. Some people only use this treatment every 6 weeks, for instance.",
      "After you're done, rinse off your face. You can just use water, since you've already cleansed your face, but you need to remove any blood traces. You can also use a gentle cleanser if you prefer. It can help to use a hydration product after you're done. For instance, a sheet mask can help you hydrate and heal. Another option is applying an anti-aging or anti-wrinkle serum after you're done. These serums will penetrate more deeply because of the micro holes. Wash your roller off using dish soap and hot water. Dish soap is better than other soaps at removing the tiny particles of blood and skin on your roller. Put the soap and water in a clean container, and shake the roller around in the water. Shake off excess water. Put the roller in 70% isopropyl alcohol. Let it soak for 10 minutes before shaking off the alcohol. Give it a chance to air dry before putting it away."

      "Damage on the frog's skin when you first get it is probably due to being banged around while in transit. However, if the injury doesn't heal in a few days the damage could be the result of a bacterial infection. If it doesn't heal over the course of a week or so, the frog needs to be taken care of by a vet.  If not treated, these infections and wounds can let harmful bacteria into your frog's body. This can result in death. Sores and bruises, as well as cuts, can cause a frog's skin to look strange. If your frog's eyes are smoky, cloudy, foggy, or blueish, it most likely has a condition known as Cloudy Eye. This occurs when the eye is bashed, poked, or scratched. If your frog's eyes are cloudy, you should get it veterinary care. If your frog has lost weight, it may have either an internal parasite or Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD). A vet can cure both MBD and a parasitic infection, so take your frog to be seen by a vet if it has lost weight. If your frog has gained weight, this is probably due to overfeeding, or it could be a sign of edema. Cut back on the amount of food it gets and make sure its weight stabilizes by weighing it every few days.  If your frog is losing weight, it could be that your frog is just naturally thin or that it needs to be fed more. You will need a digital scale to weigh your tree frog. Set a container with a lid on it on your scale and zero it out. Then put the frog in the container and read the screen. If you plan on documenting the frog's weight over time, be sure to write down its weight every time you weigh it.",
      "There are a variety of illnesses that can cause a tree frog to become discolored. Red-Leg, a common disease in pet tree frogs, causes the skin near the frog's legs to turn reddish. Sometimes something as simple as lack of humidity, stress, or a poor diet can cause a frog to have darkened skin.  If your frog's skin is dry in addition to being discolored, this can be caused by a combination of stress and dehydration. However, some tree frogs naturally have a bit of red pigment on their legs. Keep track of your frog's coloring so that you can tell when it changes. If your frog is discolored, you should have it seen by a veterinarian. Lethargy can be a key symptom of a variety of illnesses that occur in tree frogs. They include Red-Leg, MBD, edema, and others. Look for a lack of activity, the frog's jaw to hang open, and its legs to be sprawled out.  Red-Leg is often fatal — there is no known cure for it. MBD is usually curable if it is treated right away. MBD usually makes the frog stop eating and jumping. This is due to improper feeding, which causes a lack of vitamin D and calcium. Edema is when the frog swells up and becomes lethargic because it is so bloated. If your frog is lethargic and not bloated, then it does not have edema. If your frog has swollen up, it is most likely caused by edema. There are actually two types of edema. One is a bacterial infection and the other is from kidney failure due to vitamin toxicity. If it is the bacterial kind, you should soak your frog in clean spring water for a few hours to clear out the infection. The frog should be alright after that. Unfortunately, if your frog has edema caused by kidney failure, it will most likely die from the condition.  Since bacterial edema can be cleared up relatively easily at home and the one caused by kidney failure is always fatal, it is up to you whether to take your frog in to be seen by a vet. To prevent edema, clean your frog's cage weekly and change its water frequently. Dying from kidney failure can be a slow, painful process. If your frog has edema caused by kidney failure, humane euthanasia performed by your vet is an option. Changes in your frog's appetite can signal a problem with their digestive system or an illness that does not allow them to catch their prey. For example, lack of appetite is a symptom of MBD. This disease weakens the bones of your frog and decreases its energy so much that it can't chase down its prey. MBD is often caused by improper feeding. Trouble with eating could also be the result of a parasite.  If you have more than one frog housed in the terrarium, some frogs could be getting more food than others. You should also make sure you are feeding your frogs small crickets, because medium and large ones are too big for a tree frog to swallow. Your frog may be ill if it is awake during the day. Lack of sleep can occur when the frog is stressed out, such as right after you bring it home. However, it can also be a symptom of diseases that make the animal uncomfortable, such as edema.",
      "To find a vet that works with frogs, contact local veterinary schools or look online for lists of veterinarians that work with amphibians. For example, you can look at the website of the Association of Reptilian and Amphibian Veterinarians.  If there are several vets in your area who work with amphibians, make sure the vet you choose is the one that has the most experience with tree frogs. It's a good idea to find a vet before your frog is actually sick. Having an established relationship with a veterinarian that treats tree frogs will make it easier to get your pet quick care when it needs it. It is best to have your frog checked out by a veterinarian if you see a symptom of illness. While you may end up bringing your pet in for a problem that is non-existent, it is better to be safe than sorry. Some diseases require quick treatment in order to be eliminated. If you suspect that your tree frog is sick but you are unsure about bringing it in to be seen by a vet, at least call the veterinary office and talk to them. Tell them about your pet's symptoms and ask them if they think your frog needs treatment. If your tree frog is indeed ill, your veterinarian will begin its treatment and will give you instructions on how to continue treatment at home. Follow these directions and be sure to continue treatment for as long as your veterinarian suggests, even if your tree frog seems completely healed. If treatment is not minimizing your frog's symptoms or they are getting worse, contact your vet once again. It may be that your frog needs a different type or amount of treatment."

      "Stopping a Pre-Arranged Payment Before It Happens",
      "Withholding or Reversing a Payment After It Has Been Made"
    ],
    "document": [
      "If you have an automatic payment option established with your account, accessing the account online will typically allow the cardholder to view the list of pending payments along with the scheduled dates. A quick review of the upcoming payments will make it easy to see if one or more need to be stopped and rescheduled for a later date. Many providers allow a time frame in which pending payments may be canceled, changed or rescheduled. Make sure to initiate the change within the required period in order to prevent possible rejections by your bank, a situation that would result in the assessment of late charges and other fees and penalties. Stopping a scheduled credit card payment requires nothing more than telephoning the provider, identifying the upcoming payment date and canceling that pending payment. Be prepared to provide information that confirms your identity and serves as authorization to make the changes. Alternatively, log into the account using your account credentials, access the pending payments and cancel the payment or payments that need to be delayed. Keep a record of who you talked to, date, time, and outcome of call. Follow up with letter confirming conversation. Confirmation of the changes to your payment schedule are usually provided instantly in an online environment or follow shortly thereafter in the form of an official email confirmation. If the changes are made by phone, the customer service representative will confirm that the changes are complete before ending the call, and will typically offer a confirmation number. Write down the number and keep in on file, just in case the changes do not make it all the way through the system for some reason. If stopping a pre-arranged payment also means that you will be unable to make a payment on time, it is important to call the provider to notify them. This can help to potentially waive any late fees, and could establish good will. For example, if you are postponing your monthly cell phone, call the provider and notify them you will be late. They may be able waive or negotiate a one-time reduction or elimination in your late fee.",
      "If a payment has already been made to a vendor, there are certain circumstances in which you can withhold or even reverse a payment on a credit card. These rights are granted to you under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA).   Under the FCBA, if you make a purchase over $50, and the merchant is in your state, or, within 100 miles (160 km) you may withhold a purchase under various circumstances. These circumstances include: If you order a goods and they show up damaged or defective (and the seller will not take it back or replace it), if you order goods and they do not appear within 30 days (and the seller is not dealing with it), if a package you did not order appears from a merchant which has your credit card information, or if you made a purchase from a merchant that went out of business. While the FCBA does indicate you have the right to withhold payment in the above situations, it also states you can only do so if you made a good-faith effort to correct the issue directly with the merchant.  What constitutes a good-faith effort? Firstly, attempt to contact the seller via phone. If they do not answer, or if they refuse to refund payment or refund or resolve the issue, this would constitute a good faith effort. Keep records of your phone calls including name of person talked to, date, time of call, and outcome. Follow up any phone call with a letter. Explain in detail the situation, the product, and your rights as previously mentioned under the FCBA. Mail the letter to the seller (or hand deliver it if possible), and retain a copy for yourself. To withhold a payment is to not pay the amount in dispute. If you go ahead and pay the amount in dispute, this could complicate the situation, and at this point you would be looking to reverse a payment, which will be discussed in the following steps. Be sure to pay any other charges to your account that are not related to the disputed amount. This could include other charges to your card or fees. If working out the situation with the merchant directly fails, it is essential to contact your credit card issuer to inform them of the matter and express your desire to withhold payment.  Write the issuer of your credit. In your letter make sure to state your name, the card number, the name of the seller as it appears on the credit card statement, the date of purchase, the amount paid, and an explanation of your reason for withholding the purchase. It is possible to conduct this by telephone. If you do so, make sure to follow up with a letter. As well, send a copy of this letter to the merchant to ensure they are aware that you have contacted the credit card company about the matter. Make sure to retain a copy of the letter. Act as promptly as possible. The Fair Credit Card Billing act states that you have 60 days to take action after you received the bill for the disputed amount. The quicker you act the better your odds of success. The credit card company will analyze the required information and make a decision as to side either with your, or with the merchant. Often, because credit card companies want to retain customers, they will issue a temporary credit to your account in the amount of the disputed purchase.  The company will then contact the merchant. After consulting with the merchant, if the credit card company agrees that you are in the right, they will either maintain the credit they already issued you, or issue one of they have no already. If they side with the merchant, you will be required to make the payment on your card. The above steps should be sufficient to allow to withhold payment on your card. There are however some limitations in which you will not be able to withhold.  You can only withhold payments for consumer transactions. That is to say, if you are using your card to make a personal, family, or household purchase. If the card is used for business purposes, these benefits do not apply. You can only withhold payments if you used your credit card as a credit card. What this means is that if no credit was extended (like if you use overdraft or cash advance feature), you will not be able to withhold payments. You can only withhold payment if it is over $50 or if the sale took place in your home state or within 100 miles (160 km) of your home address. You can only withhold payment on the balance of the purchase that is unpaid. That is to say, the remaining unpaid balance of the purchase on the day that you initially notified the seller is the only amount you can withhold payment on. If you've already paid your credit card bill and are later unhappy with your purchase, you can request a payment be reversed or refunded. The steps to do so follow the exact steps as withholding a payment. Contact the seller first and request a refund. If unsuccessful, follow through with your credit card issuer as described above. If the credit card company deems your complaint to be valid, they will permit the reversal and issue a refund to your account. For example, if you notice  a charge on your card from a merchant that previously had your card information, or if you notice any other mysterious transactions on your card. In cases of fraudulent payments (like if you notice a transaction you simply never made, or from a merchant you have no prior relationship) simply contact your credit card company and they will quickly resolve your dilemma."

      "Make sure you keep contacts at publications and agencies that have received your work. If you are lucky, they may provide feedback for your initial submissions. Continue to build your relationships as you grow your portfolio. Take business cards, email, or add your contacts through social media. Get your images seen by donating them to conservation websites or other nature related groups. Make sure to ask if they will purchase your images first before offering to donate any image for free. Make sure to study what your peers and contemporaries are doing. Never copy anyone’s work. You may even reach out to other photographers whose work that you admire to see if you can establish a professional relationship. If you have built an extensive body of work, find an agency that will promote your work. Make sure that you understand any commits before signing any contracts with your agency. While many photographers freelance, an agency lets you concentrate on the creative side of your passion rather than worry about the business aspect. Create a website, blog, and utilize existing social media tools like Facebook and Instagram to show off your talent.  Work with a graphic designer to develop a site that stands out from other photographers. Participate in online photo sharing forums.  Choose where you post your photos because you want to make sure that the audience is large enough to garner a following. Strategically post on sites that will showcase your talent. While you are most likely promoting yourself for free, the number of views for a photo can translate to visits to your site. Your goal is to get noticed by having your photos go viral. If you have the resources you can hire someone to help you manage your website. Otherwise, read blogs, forums, or invest in classes to learn how to create and manage an effective website. Sell prints, ebooks, video tutorials, calendars, or whatever else you can on your site. Once you begin to get traffic to your site you want to be able to convert views into sales. Selling art prints alone can be a difficult source of income at first so diversify your revenue streams. Submit your work to galleries, art fairs, and printed publications. Learn how to write an article to go along with your photos as magazines will often look for stories before they look for photos. If your work is published or featured at a gallery, be sure to make a note of it on your website. Visit exhibitions and award ceremonies. Network and learn what is at the top of your field. Many digital cameras also shoot video. Learning how to shoot and edit video can give you an additional stream of income. You can sell nature footage to broadcasters specializing in educational programming like the Discovery Channel or National Geographic. Make note that learning video can double your costs depending on how much you want to invest. While there is some photography equipment that you can use for video, there is also special equipment made specifically for video. Whether you’re talking about your equipment or software, sharing your knowledge with the public shows that you have a firm grasp of your craft and that you are a trusted voice in your field. You may even specialize in order to capture a niche market like underwater photography. There are thousands of aspiring photographers in varying levels who share the same passion as you. Creating a workshop where they can meet and exchange ideas helps cultivate your presence as an expert nature photographer. It allows you to share what you have learned to others. While you will need to image editing software, it is also wise to learn web development, word processing, and bookkeeping software to help keep your business afloat. You will have to be more than a photographer in order to turn your passion into a career. You must also learn how to grow your business and each new skill can mean eliminating an outside cost. Nature photography can mean a lot of extended travel and long hours growing your business. Remember to balance your professional life and personal life. Allow your personal experience to inform your creative sensibilities.",
      "You need both ambition and confidence to succeed in a competitive field. You have to be self-critical in order to show only your best work. If you are passionate about wilderness photography you will have the drive to work hard and refine your technical and creative skills. Seek to specialize but be careful that your work isn’t to specialized that there is no market for it. You want to differentiate yourself from the crowd without fading into obscurity. Invest in the best equipment that you can afford but do your due diligence and research what’s best for your price point and skill level. Understand that while some equipment, like lenses, can last you a long time, other equipment, like the body of your camera, may get old in a couple years as newer technologies arise. Invest your money wisely and rent what you can. You may also join photography groups to pool your resources. Research on social media for clubs near your location. Being technically competent is essential to being a successful nature photographer. You don’t want to be out on the field with the perfect shot and not know how to troubleshoot a minor camera error. You may slowly take evening courses or complete a full degree. Be sure to research the instructors and institution to make sure that you are making a proper investment for your career goals. Keep only your best shots. Take as many pictures as you can so that you have a lot of variety to choose from. Be brutally honest with what your best shots are. Ask friends to help judge what should be in your portfolio. Make sure to show the variety and breadth of your skill. Show different close-ups, camera techniques, environments, etc. Depending on fees and deadlines, enter as many competitions as you can. The more prestigious the better as awards will only give you more notoriety and leverage to negotiate sales to later work. Research what the guidelines and prizes are. Some contests offer to launch your career with an immediate contract to a publication. Email photographers that you admire and politely reach out to them with any questions you may have. You be surprised at how easy it is to establish a relationship if you remain respectful of her time and passionate about her work. You may also fin photography groups on social media so that you can share your passion and support each other as you learn. A mentor is a great person to have so that you can learn tips and tricks that only someone with experience in the field can give. She can especially help in giving emotional support by letting you know that she once was just starting out and now sees the same potential in you to succeed as she has. If you are looking to grow nationally or internationally, you will need to learn how to photograph landscapes and fauna. You may also have to invest in travelling to exotic locations to capture unique wildlife. If you live in an exotic location than you are at an advantage. Becoming a professional nature photographer won’t happen overnight. You will need to invest in equipment and develop both your creative and business skills. Have patience and use your available resources to fund your passion until you receive your break. Because of the unpredictability of nature and the investment needed for exotic locations, you may need to supplement your nature photography with commercial photography.",
      "Take courses and attend lectures. Always keep learning about your craft. Whether it’s learning about new lenses or new exotic locations, keep ideas and technical skills fresh. You may take courses online if you don’t have the time to sit in a physical class or download tutorials online. Nature photography greatly relies on the sun, which can be your worst enemy or best friend. Learn how to make the most out of your lighting conditions no matter what your location and time of year. You may also learn how to specialize with certain lighting techniques. Depending on the equipment you invest in, your close ups can put your right in the action. With the right perspective and lense you can capture amazing textures and views. Research the functionality of your equipment and experiment with perspective to get you the macro shots that you are looking for. While sunsets are beautiful, there is much more to nature photography. Learn to develop your eye and create stunning perspective that makes you unique. Experiment with your location and lenses when capturing your photographs. Learn how to capture the full scope of a landscape. Lenses and software have developed so much in smartphones that you can capture quality images without bulky equipment. If you are in a pinch for time or at a precarious position, don’t be afraid to use your smartphone. In fact, you could use your smartphone to create a specialized set of photographs for your portfolio. Make sure you go to your smartphone’s camera settings menu and learn the full functionality. You’ll be surprised at what you can accomplish."

      "That is, when you're trying to meet guys or when you're going out with a shorter guy, you shouldn't feel you need to hide your height. Most people find confidence sexy, so don't try to slouch or hunch over, as that will just make you appear like you're ashamed of it. Instead, stand up straight, look people in the eye, and flash a big smile. Of course, once you're dating someone, you may decide you want to even out your heights a bit, but that is totally up to you. If you don't want to emphasize your height difference, you can stick to flats most of the time rather than wearing heels. As a bonus, you're feet likely won't hurt as much! If you want to wear heels, try a shorter pair, rather than the 4- to 5-inch variety. \" One way to even out your height differences, particularly when you're wearing heels, is to lean a little bit to the side by sticking out a hip. Obviously, you need something to lean on, such as your boyfriend. You don't want to slouch. Rather, you just want to look casual, putting you at a more even height with your boyfriend.",
      "That is, if you're concerned about the height difference, you're somewhat focused on the externals. Instead, think about what you like about him as a person, such as his charm, his wit, his intelligence, or his compassion. You can't build a relationship on height alone, but you can build a relationship on personality. If you have a guy who's significantly taller than you, you really have to strain to kiss him. With a shorter guy, you're more likely to be closer in height, making kissing easier. Pay attention when you're saying goodnight to him, and appreciate the fact that you can kiss him without pulling a muscle. Height really does open some doors, so guys who are shorter have to work harder to get ahead. That turns out to be a bonus for you because studies have shown that shorter guys usually do more of the housework than taller guys. While at first being taller than your boyfriend may make you feel tall and out of place, try to look at it another way. That is, most models are on the taller side, so standing next to him makes you look more like a model, not tall and gangly. While a short guy with a tall girl isn't as common as the opposite (a short girl and tall guy), you'll find many happy couples in the world who are similar in heights to you and your guy. Once you've observed a few couples (whether ones you know, a couple in public, or even celebrities), you'll likely find that they don't care at all about the height difference. Rather, they just care about loving each other.",
      "When trying to date online, don't filter out guys based on height. You might be filtering out someone who's actually perfect for you just because he's a few inches shorter than you'd like. In fact, try not to specifically mention a height you want in your profile, as it can turn some people off.  For instance, if you mention your height or you say, \"Only tall guys!\" many guys may figure you don't want to date them and move on, even great guys. The same is also true in real life. Don't dismiss a guy who's striking up a conversation with you just because he's an inch or two shorter. That is, many women feel like they need to be with a taller guy because they feel insecure about their own size. Having a taller guy makes them feel smaller, and subsequently, more feminine. However, how you feel about yourself shouldn't be based on how your body relates to your guy's body. You need to feel secure in your own body to feel secure in a relationship with a shorter guy.  Start by thinking about why you're finding it hard to be with a shorter guy. Does he make you feel too large? Are you embarrassed to be taller? Spend some time exploring your feelings. Try to change your thinking. Being shorter than a guy doesn't make you more feminine. It doesn't make you a giant to be taller than your boyfriend. Only you can decide if you feel feminine (if that's what you want) or unfeminine. Spend some time affirming yourself in the mirror. You could say, \"I love the soft wave of my hair.\" Building your confidence this way can help you get over some of your insecurities. That is, maybe you shouldn't wear your tallest heels if you're going on a first date with a short guy. That doesn't mean you should slouch--own your height. However, there's no need to draw attention to the height difference by adding more inches. Also, try to skip any comments about the height difference unless he brings it up with a joke. Just like you probably don't like people cracking jokes because you're tall, he probably doesn't like hearing jokes about how short he is. Try to skip the wisecracks, particularly when you're first starting out. If you've mostly dated guys who are taller than you, it may take you some time to adjust, and that's okay. You can even date other guys while you're adjusting, as long as you all agree you're not exclusive. Give yourself the time you need to get to know him and adjust your feelings about his height. Remind yourself that him being shorter than you doesn't make him less of a man and that you being taller than him doesn't make you less of a woman."

      "Visit your local grocery store or farmers market and purchase some fresh fruits and vegetables. (Organic produce is best, if possible.) Pick up some lettuce, kiwifruit, banana, bell peppers, grapes, strawberries, blueberries, or any other fruits and veggies you like. Wash them thoroughly, and cut them up into very small pieces.  Hermit crabs don't like the taste of citrus fruits like lemon and lime and will probably not eat them. They also don't like herbs (peppermint, rosemary). They tend to avoid \"Prunus fruits\" or \"stone fruits\" (cherries, apricots, plums). If you have oak trees or red maple trees in your area, these trees provide a great source of nutrition for your hermit crab. Harvest a few oak leaves and some oak bark, or some red maple leaves. Be sure to wash your leaves and bark in dechlorinated water.  Oak trees have leaves with a \"lobe and sinus\" pattern. Maple leaves have three \"fingers\" (think of the Canadian flag). Oak trees drop acorns, while maple trees drop \"helicopters.\" In addition to fruit and veggies, it is crucial for hermit crabs to have some form of protein everyday. Your crab may enjoy cooked lean beef, chicken, salmon, or shrimp. Or you can add dried plankton, krill or any other dried sea creatures (available at most pet stores). Be sure the protein you provide has not been seasoned with spices or table salt. Your hermit crab can eat almost any kind of vegetables or fruit, but they are very sensitive to fertilizers and pesticides. Whenever possible, you should seek out organic produce and untreated leaves/bark. If this is not possible, all produce should be washed thoroughly in dechlorinated water. Combine a ¼ cup of chopped fruits and veggies with ¼ cup of protein. Add a few leaves or bark (if possible), and 1 tsp. of sea salt. Mix everything together. Serve 1/3 of this mix to your hermit crab each night and refrigerate the rest. Note that sea salt is different from conventional table salt. Sea salt contains natural, unrefined minerals that are healthy for your crab, whereas table salt does not.",
      "If you’d like to make your hermit crab a snack (in addition to his daily meal), it is as easy as a quick trip to your local health food store. You will want a store with a bulk section (such as Whole Foods), this way, you can buy just a little bit of each item, and it will be inexpensive for you. You can make a hermit crab snack from a mix of unsalted nuts, whole grains, unsweetened dried fruits, and seeds. You may also want to include nutritional yeast for added B vitamins. You only need a little bit of each item (1/4 cup or less).  Nuts: pistachios, walnuts, or almonds. Grains: oats, wheat bran, wild rice, or amaranth. Dried fruits: mango, goji berries, pineapple, coconut, or raisins. Seeds: pumpkin, chia, or sesame. Choosing unsalted and unsweetened varieties is very important because table salt and processed sugar can be harmful to your crab. If you do not have access to a health foods bulk section, or if you just want to make the most of what you already have, take a look in your pantry at home. Look for any of the food items above, or for other healthy options.  Look for oats, granola, whole grain crackers, raisins, or nuts. Once again, read labels to watch out for added table salt or sugar. Take all the dry foods you have purchased or found in your pantry, and mix them all together. If using granola or whole grain crackers, crumble them up or use crumbs from the bottom of the bag. Since these foods are not considered perishable, you can place some of this food in the “crabitat” and allow it stay for 3-4 days, or until your hermit crab finishes it.",
      "When selecting food for your hermit crab, understand that your crab can eat almost any whole, unprocessed food. Food with added table salt and added sugar (such as chips, cookies, or fast food) can have a negative impact on your crab. These foods can cause digestive distress or even illness in your crab. Do not give your crab processed food. Another favorite source or protein for hermit crabs is hardboiled eggs. This can be served as part of a meal, or as a snack. Be sure to let it cool off quite a bit before offering a hardboiled egg to your crab.  Simply place eggs in a small pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 8 minutes. Some crabs may also enjoy scrambled eggs. Popcorn is a wholesome food that can be given to your hermit crab as a treat. The healthiest popcorn is air-popped without oil, but any plain popcorn (without butter) can be an enjoyable snack for your hermit crab. A cuttlebone is the flattened oval internal skeleton of the cuttlefish. Dried cuttlebones can be purchased at pet stores to feed birds, hermit crabs, and other animals. Place a whole cuttlebone in your crab’s tank for him to nibble on, or crush one up and include it in his meal. Spirulina powder is a dense super-food powder made from blue-green algae. This powder can be added to your crab’s food to supplement him with amino acids, protein, iron, and vitamins B, C, D and E. Spirulina powder is available at any health food store. Provide clean, filtered water for your crab to drink. Additionally, make a saltwater bowl available to him about once a week. You will want to replace the water in the fresh water dish each day to make sure your crab stays healthy."

      "Decide how thick you want the coat, or determine the type of finish that you want (from completely smooth to rough and textured). If you are right-handed, you will be holding the skimmer plate in your left hand and the compound applicator in your right hand. You may have to adjust your technique to get the desired thickness and texture. You can always add more compound to the surface, but once dry, it is messy and time-consuming to remove. Mound the compound up at one end of a repair area, then pull it across the surface with the compound applicator. Apply firm, even pressure in the direction of the joint/crack, similar to pulling a window squeegee, such that little material is present on either side of the repair area.  Start in one corner of the wall, and work down from the highest point. If you are skimming a ceiling, start at an edge and work towards the center. If you have never skimmed before, try practicing on a piece of scrap drywall. This way, you can get used to the applicator and the weight of the compound, and you can see what it will look like when dry. Once you have applied the first scoop, take another and work out of the spot you just finished. Be thorough—make sure that each new scoop overlaps with the last. Pull the coat in different directions to even out bumps and valleys regardless of how they are aligned.  A repair area isn't flat: it is a low, smooth mound, made to look flat. Shine a light along the surface to identify areas where the wall is sunken, and mark those spots with pencil as you go. Patience is key, but you must work efficiently so that the mixed compound does not dry out before you finish. Give yourself enough time to complete an entire section. Try not to stop in the middle of a surface, as blending a dried section with wet compound can be difficult. Do not try to rush the application by taking a larger scoop. This may make your arms tired, it may lead to compound falling off your skimmer, and you may need to go over the area later to remove excess compound. Smooth fiberglass repair tape onto cracks and joints. Let the surface set or dry out before you apply the next coat. If repair areas are deep/large, count on 2–4 coats to get solid repairs & smooth surfaces. Do not apply excess material or try to finish with one coat—this can only be fixed by demo or lots of sanding. It is better to do many thin coats than an uneven one that needs repair.",
      "Joint compound—sometimes called sheetrock \"mud\"—is very fine dust mixed with water. There are two typical choices for skim-coat materials:  Pre-mixed joint compound comes ready to apply to the surface. After application, it gradually dries out. As such, you can add more water to the mixture to extend your working time. If you have never applied a skim coat before, you may find it easiest to use a ready-to-use pre-mixed product.  \"Quick set\" is made from the same dusty base as pre-mixed joint compound, but you must mix it with water before use. Setting compounds are like concrete: they don't dry out. Instead, they undergo a chemical reaction which makes them \"set.\" Spackling is often mistakenly used as a skim-coat. However, spackling is harder to spread, more difficult to sand, and is best used on wood trim to fill large imperfections. These could include:  A ladder or scaffolding to reach high places without fatigue. This is especially important if you are applying a skim coat to a high wall or ceiling. A large five gallon bucket for mixing the skim coat. A metal mixing rod that attaches to a drill. This will make it easier to mix large amounts of compound. A mud pan. The skimmer plate. This holds the prepared compound. You will hold the skimmer plate in one hand—or place it somewhere within easy reach—while you apply the skim coat.  The compound applicator of your choice. You can use a paint roller or a flat, trowel-like \"compound applicator\". The applicator should be 6\" wider than the area being smoothed.  Use a 12\" applicator for leveling. A setting compound (\"quick set\") comes in bags, and you must mix it with water before using it. The bags have a time limit printed on them—often 20, 45, or 90 minutes—which indicates the working time under average conditions. Heat shortens working time and cold lengthens it. Mix your compound in small batches: if you mix too much at one time, it will start to dry out in the bucket before it can be applied.  The benefit of a setting compound is that it can be sanded or re-coated as soon as it sets.  This also means that you have know exactly where you will apply it and be ready, because as it stiffens it cannot be re-wetted. Setting compounds are much more durable than \"mud\" and will not come apart when wet. They are ideal for walls and ceilings in places that have been exposed to moisture, such as bathrooms and kitchens. A glop of setting compound will set even if dropped in water. Stir a bucket of ready-made joint compound with a paddle attached to an electric drill. Mix until the compound is completely smooth, adding water as needed. The resulting mixture should have the texture of custard. You can tint many joint compounds by adding tint while you are mixing. Find tint products in a hardware store. You can also add sand or other rough materials if you want a certain texture embedded in your coat. Start slow with the drill until the liquid is mixed, then gradually increase the speed. You can slowly add more liquid if you need to thin the compound. Run an image or video search for \"mixed joint compound\" to see what your compound should look like when \"ready.\"  Mixing compound is much like mixing cake batter. Remember not to pull the drill mixer out of the compound while the drill is running, or you may have flecks of mud flying everywhere. It is critical to make sure there are no lumps in your ready-to-apply compound. If you do come across a lump of dry compound during application, you can probably smash it into the surrounding wet compound. If the lump is too big to crush, remove it with a small putty knife. The five gallon bucket needs to be cleaned each time you use it, or else little pieces of dry compound will carry over to your new batch. Your helper can transfer the prepared compound from the bucket into a smaller container. From this container, use either your applicator or a smaller trowel to move the compound to the mud pan. Then, your helper can start cleaning the bucket and preparing the next batch of compound.",
      "Remove all furniture from the room. Cover the floor with a canvas or plastic drop cloth. Cover doorways with plastic sheeting—held in place with painters tape—to contain the splatters and plaster dust within the room where you are working. Remove cover plates from light switches and wall sockets to keep them splatter-free. If there is a lot of damage (nicks, cracks, large holes), you must repair these first. You may just need to finish joints between pieces of new sheetrock; maybe you have to finish broken plaster or a plaster-sheetrock joint; or perhaps you plan to repair plaster that has begun to crack from years of settling or vibration. Perhaps you simply want to flatten your popcorn-style ceiling.  Pull any nails from the surface that will receive the skim coat. Fill in the holes with joint compound. Cover any cracks in plaster walls by scraping out any loose plaster, filling the hole with joint compound, and applying joint tape to prevent the crack from spreading. Allow to dry before continuing. Dust first, then wash if necessary to remove any grease. Use a sponge or a damp towel to wipe down the surface. Use water or a wall-friendly cleaning product depending on the extent of any grime. Rinse the wall with clean water after using any cleaning product.  Sweep away loose particulates with a duster, or go over the wall with the dust-brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner.  Wipe light smudges with a damp, clean sponge or paper towel. For more resistant grime, try wiping the wall with a mix of warm water and mild detergent. Try rubbing stains with a paste of baking soda and water. Try mixing 1 cup ammonia, 1/2 cup vinegar, and 1/4 cup baking soda with one gallon of warm water for a powerful homemade cleaning agent. Consider using commercial surface-cleaning products like 409 and Pine-Sol. You should only skim over matte paint or primer. Any other painted surface should be primed with a basic primer, then prepared by wiping down with a degreaser. This allows the compound to attach to the surface and not slide off or bubble. If you have removed wallpaper from a wall, prime the surface again with an oil-based primer.",
      "Use a fine grit sandpaper (180 to 220) to smooth out any rough edges. If you marked low areas with a pencil, you can blend them into the high areas to ensure that the next coat will bond fluidly to the surface. This time, work in a horizontal direction, perpendicular to the first coat. Allow to dry. Sand once more, and run your hands over the surface to feel out imperfections that you can't see with the naked eye. With each new coat, switch direction from horizontal to vertical to ensure even coverage of the drywall. Make sure that you allow each coat ample time to dry before you apply the next coat. Vacuum the walls and make sure that there is no remaining plaster dust. Apply a primer before painting or hanging wallpaper."

      "Add orange and red vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, acorn squash, and red bell peppers to your diet, along with fruits like pumpkins, papayas, and cantaloupe. While beta-carotene doesn’t technically spur on melanin production, this fat-soluble pigment will accumulate in your skin to give you a natural golden glow. The effects of beta-carotene on skin pigmentation have been found most effective on lighter skin tones.  Many of these foods also contain Vitamin A, an antioxidant that helps support the production of melanin. Mix dark green vegetables like broccoli, spinach, and some lettuce varieties into your diet. Despite their color, these foods also contain beta-carotene.  Cooking these vegetables won’t decrease the amount of beta-carotene you ingest, so feel free to get creative in the kitchen. Vitamin E can be found in nuts, whole grains, seeds, and many fruits and vegetables including asparagus, avocados, and corn. You can get Vitamin C from citrus fruits (such as oranges, grapefruit, and clementines) as well as pineapples and bell peppers. Foods rich in both vitamins include green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, berries, and broccoli.  These foods have antioxidant properties, meaning they can help protect your skin from cell damage while encouraging balanced melanin production.  To get the highest vitamin levels from fruits and vegetables, eat them raw. Increased melanin production reduces the skin’s ability to take in Vitamin D from natural sunlight exposure. It’s a crucial vitamin for keeping the bones and blood healthy, so you should supplement your diet with a few of the foods that contain the vitamin. Incorporate fish like salmon, catfish, mackerel, and herring into your diet. Canned fish like tuna and sardines are good sources as well, as are fish oils including cod liver oil. Use moderation and eat these foods a few times a week to reduce your overall consumption of fat and mercury.",
      "Beyond incorporating vitamin-rich foods to your diet, you can boost your levels of Vitamins A, C, D, or E through supplements. Beta-carotene supplements are available without a prescription, but are typically used to treat skin conditions.  Work beta-carotene-rich foods into your diet before turning to supplements. Consult your doctor to see which, if any, supplements are right for you. Speak with your doctor about this process if you’re looking to treat vitiligo, eczema, psoriasis, or another condition. You may be prescribed a 10 mg (0.00035 oz) melanin tablet to take orally. This is followed by a photochemotherapy treatment involving exposure to UV light. Alternatively, the tablet can be dissolved in a bath and taken topically. The synthetic peptide hormone Melanotan II will speed up the body’s production of melanin. This results in a darker skin tone without any UV exposure. In consultation with your doctor, acquire the product legally with a prescription. You can use a sterile 27 gauge 1 mL (0.034  fl oz) needle to inject a dose (0.025 mg (8.8×10−7 oz) of the hormone per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of body weight) into your abdominal folds. Repeat this process on a weekly basis until you reach your desired skin tone.  Note that Melanotan-II is not FDA approved. It is typically sold online. However, sale and consumption are banned in the U.S., Europe, and Australia.  Dermatologists warn against taking these injections due to the unknown long-term effects.  Melanotan II was designed as an erectile dysfunction treatment. Be aware of the hormone’s ED-related effects.",
      "To develop an even, all-over suntan, first apply sunscreen with a minimum SPF of 15 (SPF 30 or more is a safer choice). Lay out on your back under direct sunlight with your skin exposed. After about 20 or 30 minutes, flip over to your belly. Another 20 or 30 minutes later, cover up your skin and get out of the sun.  Repeat this process a couple of times per week and you’ll start to notice your skin tone gradually deepening. Skin cells produce melanin as a way of protecting their DNA from UV damage. As you’ve probably noticed in sunnier seasons, exposing your skin to more UV radiation spurs on the production of melanin and your skin gets darker. When your skin takes in more UV radiation than it can handle, you’re left with thermal burns and blood flow increases to that area, leaving your skin red and irritated. Sunburns damage your skin cells and halt melanin production. Don’t overdo your sun exposure. Instead, limit yourself to 1 hour per day. Give your skin time to rest away from the sun’s UV rays between tanning sessions.  Don’t attempt to get a serious sunburn to “start” your tan. This habit is a myth and will slow your progress toward a gradual tan. Sunburned skin can develop skin cancer and early signs of aging.  Remember that since melanin production is a sign of skin cell damage, there’s not a “safe” way to get a suntan. Apply sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or more to all exposed areas of skin. This includes easy-to-forget areas like your feet, ears, and scalp. Lather on more sunscreen than you think you should – 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of sunscreen should effectively cover your body. Reapply sunscreen once every 2 hours, and immediately after your skin gets wet. Sunscreen doesn’t stop you from tanning, but it will help protect you from burning. Healthy, hydrated, and supple skin cells are more likely to maintain an even tone and repair themselves from UV damage. If you’re not in the habit of hydrating yet, carry around a water bottle and gradually increase your consumption from 1 bottle to 5 or more. Drinking plenty of water will prevent you from becoming hydrated. Dehydration plus overexposure to the sun can lead you to feel very ill. You won’t be worrying about your tan if you get rushed into the emergency room for an IV drip. Book an appointment at a tanning salon and select either a horizontal or vertical tanning bed. While you’re in the bed, wear protective goggles and a bathing suit. Rotate your body to achieve an even tan. Start out with short sessions of 5 to 7 minutes. In consultation with a salon technician, gradually increase your sessions once you have a deeper skin tone. The use of tanning beds is strongly discouraged by dermatologists and doctors since they can cause skin cancer. Technically, though, they do emit UV rays that will encourage melanin production and darken your skin tone over time."

      "Any type of pepper can be frozen, either raw or already roasted. The peppers typically remain flavorful for eight or nine months, but they will be mushy once thawed. This makes this method best suited for peppers that will be diced and used in recipes. Unlike most vegetables, peppers do not need to be blanched to maintain quality while frozen. This makes freezing a faster, easier preservation method than with many vegetables. Hot peppers can cause a painful skin rash. Always wear rubber gloves while handling hot peppers, and avoid touching sensitive areas of your body, such as your face. Wash anything that comes into contact with the peppers with soap and warm water before using it for anything else. While more scientific studies are needed, there is anecdotal evidence that latex gloves may not be able to prevent \"burning\" from prolonged contact with hot peppers. Cut the peppers in half and scoop out the seeds and the white membrane inside. Slice the peppers into strips, or dice them into small pieces, depending on how you prefer them in your recipes.  Red peppers are often roasted before freezing, but this is optional. Cutting hot peppers before freezing is optional. Spread the cut peppers out in a single layer, so they will freeze separately from each other and not stick together. Put the tray in the freezer until the peppers are frozen firm, checking about every twenty minutes.  A baking sheet with sides is best to prevent the peppers from falling, but you may use any flat tray. Alternatively, wrap each pepper in wax paper or another freezer-safe material instead, to keep them separate from each other. Move on to the next step. Once the peppers have been tray frozen, they are unlikely to stick together into one lump in the freezer. At this point, they can be collected and placed in airtight, waterproof containers, such as freezer-safe zip locked bags or sealed plastic containers. Remove as much air as possible from bags before closing.  Keep your freezer at 0ºF (–17.9ºC) or below for safe, long-term preservation.  Label the containers with the variety of pepper, or with the general description, such as \"spicy\" or \"bell pepper\".",
      "to create spice powder, or to preserve for cooking purposes. Peppers can be dried without any special equipment, although a dehydrator or oven can speed up the process. Peppers preserved in this way can keep for several months if stored properly. Once preserved, they can be crumbled in a blender to make a spicy topping, or soaked in water for 20 minutes to regain a palatable texture, then used in a recipe. These methods can be used for any pepper, although green peppers and bell peppers may take several hours longer than red chili peppers. Remove seeds and membranes, then cut into thin strips or cubes for fastest results. Keep the oven temperature at the lowest setting possible to avoid burning, or set a food dehydrator to 140ºF (60.5ºC) or less. Depending on the type of chili, strips or cubes may take anywhere from 4–10 hours to become completely dry. Check every couple hours, or every hour for an oven due to the less consistent temperature. You may preserve roasted peppers this way. Roast until the outer skin blisters, then cut and place the unroasted side face-down on the oven or dehydrator rack. If daytime temperatures are above 85ºF (30ºC), and full sunlight is available, you may dry hot peppers outdoors. First, remove the seeds and membrane from the peppers, then cut them into strips or dice them. Lay them out on a mesh tray or a cookie sheet for several days at least, until brittle. Bring them indoors at night if the temperature drops low enough to form dew. Bell peppers are typically too moist and thick-skinned to sun-dry. Try the oven or dehydrator instructions instead. Creating a string hung with produce, or a ristra, can provide decoration while you dry, and doesn't require anything besides a dry room with good ventilation. Thread a heavy needle with fishing line or twine, pierce the top stem of a chile, and loop the line around the top. Repeat with each chile, using the same length of fishing line, and hang the whole line up to dry.  This method is only recommended for hot red peppers, since they have thin skins with lower water content. Green peppers or bell peppers are likely to grow moldy before they finish drying. Tie clumps of two or three chiles together to create a more decorative braided ristra.",
      "Despite popular misconceptions, all types of pepper are considered a \"low acid\" food, and cannot be preserved with water-bath canning unless an acid, typically vinegar, is added to the peppers. However, the vinegar's pickling effect creates a flavor that many people enjoy. This method is also one of the best ways to retain most of the peppers' crunchy texture.   Note: Because this process can be complicated, reading all the instructions is recommended before you begin. A water-bath canner will make this easier. If you have a pressure canner, see tips for a way to preserve peppers without pickling first. Put sturdy, undamaged canning jars and lids through a hot dishwasher cycle, or place them in a pot of water and simmer, below boiling point, on the stovetop. This helps keep the jars clean, and prevents them from shattering when boiling water is poured into them. You'll need tongs to remove jars and lids from hot water. Peppers should be prepared for preservation by washing them, removing the stems and seeds, and cutting them to the size you wish. Using larger jars or non-canning jars may be unsafe for this recipe. Leave about 1/2–1 inch (1.25–2.5 cm) of head space at the top of each jar. About 1 lb (0.45 kg) of peppers is typically required for each 1 pint (475 mL) jar. Vinegar can be used as a preserving fluid for peppers, provided it's the correct type of vinegar. Try to use a high-quality vinegar with at least a 5% acetic acid content (or 50-grain strength).). Avoid using homemade vinegar unless you can be sure it meets this level of acidity. Clear liquors will preserve the original color of the pepper, while cider and wine vinegars can darken the peppers but will otherwise work just as well. A typical canning bath batch of nine pint jars (or nine 500 mL jars) requires at least 9 cups (or 2250 mL) solution. At least 1/3 of the solution should be vinegar to safely preserve the pickles, but the other ingredients are up to your taste preferences. Here are two suggestions:  For bell peppers, use 3 cups (700 mL) vinegar and 3 cups (700 mL) water, and 3 1/2 cups (815 mL) sugar. Add 4.5 tsp (22.5 mL) canning or pickling salt for flavor, unless you want to make a low-sodium version. Optionally, add 9 peeled cloves garlic for flavor. For hot peppers, or a mix of hot and sweet peppers, try 5 cups (1200 mL) vinegar, 1 cup (240 mL) water, and 2 tbsp (30 mL) sugar instead of a tarter result. Optionally, add 2 tbsp (30 mL) canning or pickling salt, and 2 cloves of garlic. Transfer the vinegar and water solution to a large pot over medium or high heat. Wait for the mixture to reach a rolling boil, then immediately remove from heat. Boiling helps eliminate germs and microbes that can contaminate the preserved peppers. If you accidentally leave the solution boiling for more than a couple minutes, you may wish to add a little more vinegar and bring to a boil a second time. Over-boiling can destroy some of the acetic acid in the vinegar, which is the main preservative. Pour your hot mixture of vinegar, sugar, and water into each pepper container until the peppers are fully covered by liquid. Try to still leave about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space at the top of the jar or container. Run a knife around the rim of each jar to dislodge air bubbles. Use a damp, freshly cleaned cloth to wipe the inner rim of each jar for additional cleaning. Seal the canning jar according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically by placing the lid on top and screwing the rim over it and the jar. Fill a water-bath canner, or a large pot with a metal rack on the bottom, about half full of water. Heat this until it is almost boiling, then lower the sealed jars onto the rack. Move the jars so none of them are touching each other, or the sides of the container. The water must be deep enough to cover the jars with at least 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) of water. The jars must be boiled for a certain amount of time, to create a safe environment for preservation. Start timing the peppers once the water begins boiling, not when they are lowered into the water. If the boiling is interrupted, you must begin timing from the beginning.  If you are at a high altitude, start with the times below, then add an additional 2 minutes per 1,000 ft (300 m) above sea level.  Boil hot peppers for at least 15 minutes in jars up to 1 pint (500 mL). Boil sweet peppers or bell peppers for at last 10 minutes in jars up to 1 pint (500 mL). Safe boiling times for larger jars have not been established for these recipes. You may be able to find another pickled pepper recipe with a recommended boiling time for 1 quart (1 L) jars. Store your finished peppers in a cool, dark place, no warmer than 75ºF (24ºC). Under these conditions, the pickled peppers can typically last for one to two years. Once you open a jar, keep it in the refrigerator until the peppers are eaten. Do not eat pickled peppers from a jar with a rounded or bulging lid, or if the peppers have turned brown or black."

      "Infants with cradle cap often have other symptoms related to dry, easily-irritated skin. Use a humidifier in your baby's room to keep the air moist and humid so his or her skin doesn't get too dry. Applying a moisturizer while the scalp is still slightly damp and warm after bathing can help trap moisture in the skin, preventing it from becoming dry and scaly. Use a lotion or ointment formulated for babies' sensitive skin. Cradle cap is in some cases caused by an allergy to baby formula. If your baby has red patches on his or her face and experiences diarrhea and other allergy symptoms in addition to cradle cap, talk to your doctor about switching to a formula that is healthier for your baby.",
      "The baby's scalp won't be harmed if you use your hands to take off the \"cap.\" It's the simplest, and one of the most effective, ways to get rid of the scales and dry patches that occur when a baby has cradle cap.  Rub your fingers over the scaly patches, then gently peel and scrape away the scaly dead skin and discard it. If you don't want to use your fingers to pick off the scales, put on a pair of thin latex gloves (as long as your baby isn't allergic to latex). You could also cover your hands with plastic wrap to prevent directly touching the scales. Keep in mind that cradle cap is not contagious, and picking off the scales will make your baby more comfortable. Don't use tweezers or another sharp tool to remove the scales, since you may accidentally poke the baby's head and cause an injury. every day. Use warm water to bath the baby's head, and gently massage his or her scalp with your fingers. The water will help loosen the cradle cap scales, when you can then peel or scrape away.  Using a mild baby shampoo can help loosen the scales, so consider adding one to your washing routine. However, you may find that shampoo dries the baby's scalp out further. Use a soft-bristled brush to help loosen the scales while the baby's head is still wet. Sometimes cradle cap scales need a little outside help before you can peel them off. Spread baby oil or petroleum jelly on the dry patches, then wait 15 minutes to let the scales soften before removing them.  Olive oil and vegetable oil also work well for removing the scales. Use shampoo and warm water to wash away the oil when you're finished. Leaving traces of oil can actually make the problem worse by causing more scales to form.",
      "When cradle cap keeps coming back a few days after you scrape it away, switching to a medicated shampoo a few times a week might be an effective treatment. Dandruff shampoos contain tar, which reduces flakiness and helps prevent skin from drying out.  Shampoos containing the antifungal medication ketoconazole or 1 percent selenium sulfide may also be used to treat cradle cap.  Dandruff shampoos that contain salicylic acid aren't recommended for babies, since this ingredient may be harmful to babies and it can be easily absorbed through their skin.  Talk to your doctor before using a medicated shampoo on your baby's scalp. He or she will recommend a shampoo brand or provide you with a prescription for the shampoo that is right for your baby's needs. If your baby's scalp is inflamed, red or itchy, hydrocortisone cream, which is also used to treat rashes and bug bites, might help relieve the symptoms. Check with your doctor before using an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream."

      "It’s normal for people to fall out of touch, but you should still offer an apology to start off on the right foot. You could say, “I’m sorry it’s been so long since we talked. I’ve been really busy.” Since you haven’t talked in a while, you probably have a lot to catch up on. Tell your friend about any exciting developments in your life, and ask what’s new with them. You could say, “Since we last talked, I started dating someone. It’s been going great. Have you started dating anyone?” Spend a little time talking about the things you both love. If you’re avid soccer fans, use a few lines to recap your favorite team’s most recent game. Don’t forget to ask for their opinion, too. Say something like, “That game the other week was insane! What did you think about the final goal?” If you want to invite your friend to hang out soon or attend your party, now’s the time to let them know. You might say, “I’m having a baby shower next Tuesday evening. Do you think you can make it?",
      "Explore the formatting bar, which is a row of icons located at the top or bottom of your window, to check out different font and text color options.  If your email is about a serious subject, it’s best to stick with plain black text in a basic font.  If your friend has a different email server, some fonts may not show up. Arial, Times, Verdana, Trebuchet, and Geneva are usually safe.  Try not to go overboard with different fonts and colors. Your text should still be easy to read. If you’re writing a fun email to a good friend, a few cute emojis here and there could make your email extra friendly. However, if you’re writing an email about a more serious topic, you should steer clear of emojis. They’ll make your email seem too lighthearted. Be careful not to use too many emojis--it can be distracting. Send your friend kind wishes, let them know if you’d like them to write back, and tell them you hope to see them soon. You might say, “I hope that you have a great week. I can’t wait to hear from you!” End your email with a closing, like “best wishes,” “talk to you soon,” or “love.” Then, skip a couple lines and type your name. Click the “insert photo” button, which usually looks like a picture or camera icon. It’ll be next to all the other formatting buttons. Then, you can pick photos from your computer to upload.  If you’re writing an email telling a friend about your new dog, it might be a good idea to send along a picture of the pup! Try to only attach a few photos. If you attach too many, your email may end up in your friend’s spam folder. When you’ve finished your email, read through it once or twice to look for spelling and grammar mistakes. A mistake-free email will be easier for your friend to read. If you’re a kid, get a trusted adult to help you out. Double check to make sure you have the right email address for your friend, too. When your email is ready to go, click the button at the bottom of your email that says “send.” All done!",

Otherwise, you can ask another friend. Type their email address into the box labeled “To.” The subject box is located below the “To” box and labeled “Subject.”  Summarize your email in a few words here so your friend knows what to expect.  If you’re just writing to say hello, your subject line could be as simple as “Hi!” If you’re writing to invite your friend to your birthday party, you could make the subject, “Invitation to my birthday party.” Start your email with a greeting, followed by the person’s name and a comma. Since this is an email to a friend, you can say something casual like “hi,” “hey,” or “hello.” ”Hi Kate,” is an example of a basic greeting. Skip a line, and ask a question like, “How are you doing?” or make a statement like, “I hope you’re doing well.” This shows your friend you care about them.",
      "Maybe you’re writing to see how their vacation is going, or to check in after an illness. Either way, start off your email by stating your purpose for writing. Say something like, “I heard you had the flu, and I wanted to see how you’re doing.” Now that you’ve finished your introduction, it’s time to get down everything you want to tell your friend. Break up big chunks of text into paragraphs of three or four sentences to make your email easier to read. You may want to use all caps to show your excitement, but it can seem like you’re yelling. Instead, use asterisks or bold your text to highlight the important parts. Ask questions related to what you’re saying. This shows your friend that you’re interested in their opinion, too.

Ants are attracted to even the tiniest of spills, so make sure to clean up after yourself regularly to keep them from coming in. It's important not to leave food out for more than a little while - otherwise, the ants will sense that it's there and come to get it. If you have an ant problem, you might have to take extra measures to make sure your food is packaged tightly.  The following foods should never be left out where the ants can access them:  Maple syrup Juice Sugar Cracker crumbs Fruit with thin skin, like strawberries Is it easy for ants to walk right into your house? You might want to look into sealing your doors and windows so that the ants won't be able to come inside. Use caulk and door seals to take care of the crack under your door and along the sides of your windows. Examine your house from the outside, too, to determine if there are any holes or cracks where they might be coming in.",
      "This substance is completely natural and safe for use around humans and pets, but it kills ants and other crawling critters. It's composed of ground up fossil pieces that cut into insects' exoskeletons when they walk over it. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth in corners, under the sink, in windowsills, and anywhere else you often see ants.  Every week or two, vacuum up the diatomaceous earth and replace it with fresh powder. This substance doesn't work as well in humid areas, since it loses its sharpness when it becomes wet. If you have a lot of black ants on your carpeting, cover it in a fine layer of baking soda, let it sit for a few hours, then vacuum it up. You can also apply cornstarch to a surface and vacuum it up immediately before you try to vacuum up the black ants. The added cornstarch in the vacuum will suffocate the animal. Certain natural sprays act as insect repellents. You can easily make your own by adding 10 drops of essential oil to a cup of water, then pouring it into a spray bottle. Spray the mixture all over your house to keep ants away. Here are a few essential oils to try:  Eucalyptus oil (don't use this one if you have a cat) Tea tree oil Lavender Peppermint Lemon Windex You might already have a box in your laundry room. This household substance doubles as a very effective insecticide. Simply sprinkle boric acid in corner and around room perimeters. Ants and other critters will die after crawling over the powder. If you don't have any other repellent on hand, try sprinkling some cinnamon in the room where the ants are gathering. Ants are repelled by the fine powder and strong smell. While sprinkling cinnamon won't kill the ants, it might keep them from coming back.",
      "Using a commercial bait is a very effective way to kill black ants. Ants are attracted to the bait, which is a mixture of poison and a sweet substance. The ants eat some bait and bring some back to the nest, where the rest of the colony is also exposed to the poison. Over the course of one or two life cycles, the ants will be destroyed.  If you decide to use bait, be sure you take the precaution of making sure that there are no children or pets in the area. Commercial ant bait is available in hardware stores for about $4 per box. Follow the instructions on the packaging to get the bait traps ready, then place them on your countertops, in corners and in any other areas where you frequently see ants gather. If possible, place a trap in front of an ant trail. Different types of bait traps require different preparation. Some traps require you to place a few drops of bait on pieces of cardboard, then place the cardboard around your house. Other traps simply require peeling back a plastic wrapper and setting out the traps. Bait traps take a little longer to work than spraying and other methods of killing ants, but they are ultimately much more effective. Over the course of a few days, the ants will carry the bait back to their nest and poison the rest of the colony. In the meantime, make sure your house is clean of other food sources so that the ants eat the bait, not crumbs or sticky spots in your kitchen. If you want to make doubly sure the ants are gone for good, you can spray a pesticide as well. Purchase a store formula, mix up the contents based on the instructions, place the solution in a sprayer and spray the infested rooms. You may also apply the solution to the perimeter of your home to keep ants from coming inside.  Make sure that children and pets stay away from the sprayed areas, since they can become ill if they ingest the chemicals. You can also purchase an aerosol spray to apply directly on the black ants. These are usually indoor formulas that work well in areas like your kitchen. Apply the spray anywhere you see ants, and any cracks and/or crevices that you see them crawl into. This method usually leads to immediate death so sweep up any dead ants and dispose of them properly. If you spray in an area that children or pets may be in, be sure to adequately wipe down and clean the area so no one gets sick from the spray."

      "A homemade sling may be a good choice for minor arm injuries, but it's not enough to ensure proper healing in the case of serious fractures or dislocations. Allow a doctor to examine the injury, take x-rays, and discuss a treatment plan with you. A doctor's final treatment plan may involve the use of a sling – but your injury might also require a cast or surgery. If you use a homemade sling to set a broken bone or a dislocated limb, your arm might heal poorly. You may experience lasting discomfort, and you may need further medical attention.  Common symptoms of broken arms include: Intense pain Tenderness Swelling Loss of motion or decreased sensation Possible open wound with bone sticking out Difference in appearance relative to the uninjured arm   Common symptoms of dislocated arms (most commonly in the form of a dislocated shoulder) include: Pain in the arm, shoulder, and/or collarbone Deformation (a bump on or near the shoulder) Swelling Bruising When a broken bone sticks through the skin—or a wound forms in which bone is visible following a fracture—this is called an \"open fracture\" or \"compound fracture.\" These fractures are exceptionally painful, dangerous, and difficult to treat. Be aware that the types of injuries that cause compound fractures can also cause other serious trauma. It is essential that you get yourself prompt, effective medical treatment. Do not try to realign compound fractures without the help of a qualified medical professional. The only exceptions to this rule are rare, special cases: when you will not be able to secure immediate medical treatment, and setting a compound fracture by hand is preferable to the alternative of doing nothing at all. You should only ever attempt to realign broken bones when signs of poor circulation appear. Again: if possible, wait for a doctor to reset your broken bones. The exception is when it appears that a fracture is preventing blood from circulating through the limb. Your limb may not be receiving any blood if the area of the limb past the fracture looks pale or blue, has no pulse, loses sensation, or grows cold. In these cases, the potential loss of the limb outweighs the dangers of having an amateur re-set the bone – or of doing the job yourself. If this is the case, visit How to Realign a Fractured Bone for more information.",
      "This method uses a square of fabric to replicate the functionality of a real sling. Depending on your height and size, the precise size of the  cloth you'll need can vary. For most people, a square of fabric that's roughly 40 inches (1 meter) on each side will work well. Ideally, you'll want a fairly inelastic piece of fabric - stretchy fabric allows your arm to bend and move, which can aggravate your injury.  One easy way to get a 40 inch (101.6 cm) square piece of fabric is to cut an old pillowcase or bed sheet that you don't mind ruining  to size with a pair of sharp scissors or a fabric knife. In a pinch, you can even use your bare hands to tear these things to the right size. When it comes to your sling fabric, err on the side of using a fabric square that's too big, rather than too small. A sling that's too big can be tightened by adjusting the knot behind your head while wearing the sling, but there's no real way to make a sling looser than the length of its fabric allows. Next, you'll want to fold the fabric of the cloth across itself diagonally to form a triangle. When worn as a sling, the \"fat\" middle portion of the triangle will support your arm and the thin corners of the triangle will form a comfortable neckband behind your head. If, for some reason, you find that the sling isn't comfortable while folded, you can alternatively cut the square diagonally to create the same shape. When wearing the sling, your arm will be held in contact with cloth which, if you're making your own sling from home materials, has probably not been disinfected. Thus, if your injured arm has any open wounds, it's extra-important to insure that all of your wounds are cleaned, dried, and carefully bandaged before you introduce them to the sling's material. Below is a rough guide for cleaning minor wounds - see How to Care for Minor Abrasions and Scratches for more information. If you have a serious injury or see a bone at the site of the injury, don't attempt to make yourself a sling - go to a hospital immediately.  First, wash any open wounds BUT do not use extremely cold or extremely hot water. And use slow flowing water. Not harsh. If you do anything mentioned not to, you will surely hurt your arm even more. Remove dirt or any other debris from the wound with a clean pair of tweezers if it is not rinsed out by water. Apply a bandage over the wound. Use a bandage that covers the wound completely with no adhesive portion touching the wound itself. If needed, you may want to place clean gauze between the bandage material and the wound. You also may need to have a splint, in which case you should apply it first before the sling. Do not directly touch the wound unless you have medical experience. Next, you'll want to take off any rings, bracelets, and/or armbands that you are wearing on the injured arm. If the injured arm swells as it heals, jewelry (particularly tight-fitting pieces) can constrict the flow of blood to the arm, causing pain and irritation and even becoming stuck. Position your injured arm at a 90 degree angle across your chest (horizontal to the floor). Use your other arm to slip the folded, triangular piece of fabric over the shoulder of your uninjured arm. Let the rest of the fabric hang so that it lies behind the injured arm with the \"point\" of the umbrella pointing roughly towards the hip that is on the same side of the body as the injured arm. Use your uninjured arm to grab the corner of the triangle that is pointing towards the floor and bring it up across your body, over the opposite shoulder as the other end of the fabric, and behind your neck. Do this gently, as the fabric should now be touching the injured arm and can jerk on the arm if pulled roughly. The length of the sling material should be such that the injured arm can hang comfortably at a roughly 90 degree angle. Your fingers should extend just far enough beyond the \"cuff\" of the sling that it's possible to use them for simple tasks like writing while the hand is still supported by the sling. If this is not the case, adjust the fit of the sling as needed. When you've found a comfortable length for your sling, tie a simple knot in the two ends of the sling material to secure the sling behind your neck. If you need to adjust the height at which your sling hangs, loosen this knot and tie a new one either further \"up\" or \"down\" the length of the fabric. Congratulations! Your new sling is ready to wear.  If this knot uncomfortably digs into your neck, slip a small pad or towel under it. Be sure to avoid the hair at the nape of your neck when tying your knot. If you accidentally tie some of your hair into the knot, it can be painfully yanked when you move your arm or walk. If you have a safety pin handy, pin the two edges of the sling material near your elbow together. This creates a \"backstop\" for your elbow to rest against. Without this backstop, it's possible for your arm to slip out the back of the sling as you move or for the sling material to bunch up near your wrist. A sling transfers the weight of your injured arm onto your upper back and neck. This added burden can cause back and neck strain - even if you don't experience serious strain, over time, you'll probably notice that your sling causes the area between your shoulder blades to become fatigued. Lessen this effect by maintaining proper, erect posture. See below for brief posture instructions:  When you stand while wearing your sling, keep your back straight and your shoulders in a pulled-back but relaxed position. Keep your chin up and avoid slouching. When you sit while wearing your sling, keep your back against the chair's backrest, if there is one. Keep your back straight and upright. Keep your head and chin up so that your neck stays straight. Keep your feet planted on the ground. Don't sink into a slump or slouch. If you can comfortably support your arm on the chair's armrest, you may do so. If at any point while wearing a sling, you experience severe back or neck pain, see a doctor. Avoid wearing a sling if you have a known neck or back ailment.",
      "Modern slings are much more comfortable, ergonomic, and protective than what most individuals can craft. However, arm injuries can happen and you may have to improvise. If you are injured in the wilderness while on a camping trip, if may be impossible to obtain cloth to make the sling above. It is certainly better than no sling at all. Use a sweater, sweatshirt, button-up shirt, or other long-sleeved garment. Tie the garment's sleeves behind your head and carefully insert your injured arm through the loop formed. Allow the clothing material to support the weight of your arm somewhere along the forearm or wrist - wherever is comfortable.  Try to adjust the length of the garment's sleeves that your knot allows to hang so that your arm can hang at a roughly 90 degree angle (horizontal to the ground). If you have safety pins handy, you may want to try \"closing\" the fabric of the long-sleeved garment around your elbow as a makeshift backstop for your sling as described in the method above. One piece of clothing seemingly tailor-made for improvised slings is the belt, due it having the built-in ability to form a loop with an adjustable size. Secure the belt buckle behind your neck and slip your arm through the loop formed by the rest of the belt. Allow your arm's weight to be supported by the belt along the forearm or wrist. Tie or fasten the belt behind your neck so that your arm is supported at a 90 degree angle. The belt's buckle can be uncomfortable against the back of the neck, so may want to shift the belt so that the buckle is in the length of belt stretching between your arm and neck. You can also put padding between the belt and your neck for greater comfort. If you're injured in an office setting or while wearing formal wear, a necktie can suffice as a makeshift sling until a real one is available. As with the methods above, simply tie the necktie behind in a simple knot your neck and pass your arm through the loop formed. Adjust the positioning and length of your makeshift sling so that your arm hangs at a 90 degree angle. Duct tape can be used very effectively to help immobilize the arm. It has strength, flexibility, and a fabric-like quality which lends itself quite well to this situation.  A loop of duct tape can substitute for a belt or tie, supporting the wrist, arm, and elbow. Duct taping the injured arm to the torso can help reduce movement. Be sure to avoid getting duct tape residue on the skin. Duct tape should be faced so that it does not adhere to the skin. The types of situations in which you'll need to make a sling from your clothing are usually situations in which actual medical care is for some reason unattainable. If your injury is at all serious or persistent, seek the help and advice of a trained medical professional as soon as you can. Improvised slings are usually better than no sling at all, but they are no substitute for a real sling (to say nothing of the other treatments for an injured arm that a hospital can provide). It's better to be safe than sorry - don't risk worsening your arm injury by neglecting to show it to a doctor."

      "If you made a single round cake or Bundt cake and want to make a layer cake, take a sharp knife and cut the cake in half to separate the top and bottom into two layers. If you baked more than one cake and are going to layer them, don’t cut them in half. Place the cakes in the refrigerator for about an hour before frosting it. This will make the cake stiffer, less delicate, and easier to work with. Place the bottom layer of cake on a cake plate. With a frosting knife or icing spatula (or a regular butter knife), spread a thin layer of icing on top of the first layer of cake. Refrigerate for 15 minutes before proceeding. If you want to add an extra element to your cake, consider adding a layer of fruit, jam, custard, or ganache on top of the icing. Raspberry, strawberry, and cherry are traditional fruit or jam choices to pair with cake. Carefully place the second layer of cake back on top of the first layer. With your frosting knife, apply a thin layer of frosting to the entire cake. This is called the crumb coat, and it will keep the final decorative layer of frosting clean and crumb free.  If you made a Bundt cake, don’t forget to frost the inner well along with the outside of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for 20 to 30 minutes before applying the final layer of frosting. If you are using a glaze, drizzle glaze evenly over the top of the cake one spoonful at a time. Allow the glaze to drip down over the sides of the cake. Apply a thicker and even layer of frosting over the entire crumb coat. Use the back of the spatula or knife to even out the frosting and make the surface as smooth as possible.  For an added touch, sprinkle the top with fruit, coconut flakes, cocoa powder, or citrus zest. Serve immediately, or cover with a lid until you're ready to eat. ",
      "Along with your ingredients for the cake recipe, you'll also need some utensils and equipment, including:  A hand mixer or stand mixer Cake pans: one 9-by-13-inch pan, two nine-inch pans, or one Bundt pan Grease or parchment paper A large mixing bowl A large spoon or paddle For this butter cake recipe, you will want your oven preheated to 350 F (177 C). While you're waiting, grease your cake pans with butter, baking spray, or vegetable shortening. On top of the greased pan, sprinkle a pinch of flour to create a light dusting. If you'd rather not used greased pans, you can instead line your cake pan with parchment paper. Add the butter and sugar to your mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients together with your mixer on low speed. Continue beating for five to 10 minutes.  As the butter and sugar incorporate, increase the speed to medium, and finally to high for the last minute or two. Creaming the butter and sugar together in this way will create a light and fluffy cake that has plenty of volume, because the process whips air bubbles into the butter. Crack each egg separately into a small bowl and beat it a little before adding it to the flour and sugar mixture. This will give you time to remove any shell pieces, and will prevent the mixture from curdling. Turn the beaters on low and have them running as you add each egg.  You want the eggs at room temperature because a warm egg won’t decrease the final volume of the cake. Continue beating the mixture until all the eggs have been incorporated and the mixture is smooth and yellow. Beat on low until everything is incorporated. Don’t overmix, as this will produce a cake that’s tough instead of fluffy. Once added, beat the mixture on low for about 30 seconds. If there is any unincorporated batter on the sides of the bowl, use the spoon or paddle to scrape it down. Increase the speed to high and continue beating for a minute or two. If you're making more than one cake, divide the batter evenly between the two pans. Use your spoon to wipe the sides of the bowl so you don’t waste any batter. There are a few ways to tell when your cake is ready, and they include when:  The cake springs back when pressed gently with a finger The cake starts pulling away from the sides of the cake pan A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean Place the cake on a wire rack and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. After this time, remove the rack from under the cake and place it on top of the cake pan. Flip the cake pan over and let the cake slide onto the rack. Let the cake continue cooling to room temperature before storing or frosting. If you are going to be serving and eating the cake immediately, proceed with layering, filling, or frosting.  For a cake that will be used within the week, wrap it in plastic and store it in a cool, dry place on your counter.  For a cake that will be used within three months, wrap it in plastic and store it in the freezer.",
      "There are many different types of frostings, icings, and glazes you can use to finish your butter cake, and a vanilla buttercream is a common and delicious choice. To make this frosting:  Place 1 cup (225 g) of softened butter in a mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat on medium for about three minutes. Working in 1/2-cup increments, add 3 to 4 cups (345 to 460 g) of confectioner’s sugar (add closer to 4 cups for a firmer icing). When all the sugar has been incorporated, turn the beaters to high and mix for 10 seconds. Add a pinch of salt and 2 teaspoons (12 ml) vanilla. Beat until incorporated. Beat in 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) of milk or cream until the frosting reaches the desired consistency. This is a variation on a basic buttercream, but the brown butter adds a richness and nuttiness to the frosting. To make this frosting:  On medium heat, melt 6 tablespoons unsalted butter (85 g) in a small saucepan. Stir constantly until the butter foams, bubbles, and turns a golden color. This will take about four to six minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. In a mixing bowl, add butter, 3 cups (345 g) confectioner’s sugar, and 1 ½ teaspoons (9 ml) vanilla. Beat on medium speed, and slowly add 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60 ml) milk until you achieve the desired consistency. Chocolate is another great frosting type for a butter cake, and can add another dimension to the vanilla flavor of the cake. This recipe is similar to a vanilla buttercream, but you add chocolate and malted milk powder to the mix and use less vanilla.  In a mixing bowl, add ½ cup (115 g) softened unsalted butter and 1 teaspoon (6 ml) vanilla. Mix on low to combine. Continue mixing, and gradually add in 2 cups (230 g) confectioner’s sugar, ½ cup (59 g) cocoa powder, ½ cup (65 g) malted milk powder, and a pinch of salt. One tablespoon (15 ml) at a time, add in 7 tablespoons (105 ml) of milk until the frosting is smooth, light, and spreadable. Citrus glazes also work well with butter cakes, and they are less rich than a buttercream frosting. You can use any citrus you want, or a combination, including orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit, or any other citrus you prefer. For the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk or beat together 1 cup (115 g) confectioner’s sugar, ¼ teaspoon (the zest from a small wedge) orange zest (grated), and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of juice from a freshly squeezed orange. Whisk until all the ingredients are incorporated and you have a smooth icing."

      "To have full rights to custody or visitation, the father must be recognized as a legal parent. Once paternity is legally recognized, he has rights to custody or visitation, and also the obligation to child support. It is illegal to have a child and not pay toward his or her well-being. This is the simplest way to establish paternity.  This can be done at your local court, welfare office, family law facilitator or registrar of births. You can also receive the form by mail and sign it before a notary public. POP is a program in the California Department of Child Support Services that acts as a court. Once your declaration is filed here, the declaration will be legally binding and you will have custody rights. You will need to apply for a new birth certificate with the father's name afterward. If there is a dispute about who the father is, you will have to talk to your family law facilitator about how to bring an action in your specific case. You can find your family law facilitator by following the link for your county from the California Court’s Family Law Facilitators List. This will need to be signed by both parties once the father has been established as having the rights and responsibilities of a legal parent. In order to fill out this form, you will need to come to a custody and visitation agreement. You need to make a copy for yourself and for the other parent. The original will be filed with the court. The court will stamp the papers as \"filed,\" keeping the original and returning the copies to you.  Once the forms are filed, the court has approved the order and it is legally binding.",
      "If there is still interest in maintaining a relationship between the parent and child, a mediator may suggest visitation under strict guidelines. If your child(ren)’s other parent is abusing you, you may ask for both custody and a domestic violence restraining order at the same time. The forms you need as well as interactive instructions for completing and filing the forms, are provided online.  Following the instructions included with your forms, type or print neatly in blue or black ink, filling in each numbered item as necessary. California family court services can provide assistance. Just check with your local county court or online at the California court website. You county facilitator can look at forms to make sure that you have filled everything out correctly.

      "During a divorce that involves children, one of the major questions will be who gets custody, and what the non-custodial parent's visitation rights will be.   It is best if the plan can be created together with the child's or children's best interests in mind. Remember that change is difficult for children. Try to put aside previous disputes and personal desires, and make rational decisions about the future of the children. Physical custody is defined by who the child lives with.  If it is possible for the child to live in a place consistent with where they have been living that is probably preferable to a big move. Remember that handling the child's day to day needs is a major undertaking and you need to have the capacities and resources to handle it on your own. Legal custody is defined by who handles major decisions in the child's life. This does not have to be the same person who has physical custody.  For example, one parent can have physical custody while they have joint legal custody. The decisions the legal custodian is responsible for include what schools are attended, which religious institutions, if any, are joined, and what doctors and dentists the child sees. If you have any trouble reaching agreement, try talking with a third party who can act as a neutral negotiator to help you make the best decisions.  A mediator can be a lawyer who understands all the relevant legal details, although they do not have to be. A mediator cannot be an attorney who already represents one of the sides of the divorce. If your difficulties are in resolving emotional disputes, a counselor can act as a mediator to help in putting aside anger and resentment when your child's interests are at issue. If you come to an agreement or you negotiate a reasonable option through a mediator, but your ex refuses to follow it, you can turn your agreement into a court order.  Before you file the forms with a judge, your agreement is binding just between the two of you. Once one of you stops following the agreement, you can bring a legal authority in to enforce matters. If you are unable to come to an agreement, you can return to a mediator. A judge will enforce an agreement that has been reached. This will need to be signed by both parties and will serve as a legal contract between the two of you.   Following the instructions included with your forms, type or print neatly in blue or black ink, filling in each numbered item as necessary. If you are unable to agree on what the details of the custody and visitation form should be, you will need to consult a mediator. California family court services can provide various forms of assistance to help parents come to some kind of contract that best serves the needs of the child or children. Before anything is signed, it is best to make sure things are in order and as you intend them.  If your county has a family law facilitator, ask that they review your forms before you file them, to ensure that you have completed everything correctly and your case will not be held up due to missing information. You can find your family law facilitator by following the link for your county from the California Court’s Family Law Facilitators List. When you file a form with the court, make sure you have a copy and the other parent also has a copy. The court clerk will stamp the original and the copies as \"filed\" and retain the original document. This means the agreement is legally binding. If the other parent is not holding to the agreement that you reached, you can now take them before a judge with a charge.",
      "A guardian can be a grandparent or other relative, or a friend or appointee of the state, who is interested in caring for the child while the parents are unable or unwilling to do so. It is not the same as a full adoption.  Adoption legally erases any rights of the birth parents and declares the adopting parents to take on those rights. Guardianship just establishes custody, and leaves the birth parents an avenue to reestablish custody. The forms you need as well as interactive instructions for completing and filing the forms, are provided online.  Following the instructions included with your forms, type or print neatly in blue or black ink, filling in each numbered item as necessary. California family court services can provide assistance. Just check with your local county court or online at the California court website. You county facilitator can look at forms to make sure that you have filled everything out correctly.  You can find your family law facilitator by following the link for your county from the California Court’s Family Law Facilitators List. You need to make a copy for yourself as well as both parents and any other relatives or agencies who are concerned with the child. The original will be filed with the court. The court will stamp the papers as \"filed,\" keeping the original and returning the copies to you.  Once the forms are filed, the court has approved the order and it is legally in motion. Serve the copies of the papers to the relatives and agencies who previously were caring for the child.  To insure that everyone is fully aware that you have taken custody, the papers must be legally served by someone unconnected to the case, who is 18 years or older, to every concerned party.  The server must fill out a \"proof of service\" form and return this to you. You will need one for each person you are giving notice to, or \"serving\" the forms to. After the papers have been served, the court needs to be notified that everyone involved in the case is aware of the petition.  If the server gave the papers to the concerned parties in person, he or she will fill out the Proof of Personal Service form. If the server sent the papers by mail, they will fill out a different form, the Proof of Service by Mail form. Both of these are attached to Notice of Hearing--Guardianship or Conservatorship. You will be granted a hearing at which interested parties will have the opportunity to make statements regarding the motion. There may be an investigation or interview before the official hearing.  Arrive on time, answer any questions clearly and politely, and do your best to make a good impression. The judge will then decide whether to grant your petition. If you are granted custody, you need to file the Order Appointing Guardianship of the Child with your county clerk. This confirms that the decision of the judge was what you were seeking and tells the city what has happened.  If you do not file the official order it has not been certified. If your petition is granted and certified, you will need to follow up with yearly reports to the court on the status of the child and your guardianship."

      "The laser driver is the electrical component that controls the functioning of the laser. The diode will likely need soldered to the laser driver. There should be two leads coming from the diode for this purpose. Use a soldering gun to solder the leads to the driver at the positive and negative terminals. These terminals should be labeled on the driver and extend to the edge of the driver for soldering purposes. The driver should not be connected to any power source until soldering is complete. After the diode has been connected to the driver, you can connect the driver to a power source. Batteries are the go to choice since they make your laser portable. You will need at least AA batteries to produce a burning laser. The driver will have leads for a power supply. These leads will need to be connected to a battery pack or directly to the battery. If the leads need soldered, you will have to use a battery pack. You cannot solder onto a battery. You can buy a laser casing online to house the parts of your laser. Alternatively, you can make a laser casing from things lying around your house. Popular items used to make casings include Altos mint cans, bic lighters, and the casings of weaker laser pointers.",
      "A laser lens is needed to condense the light from a wide pattern to a thin beam. This concentrates the energy of your laser. This concentrated beam is what allows you to burn things with your laser. Glass lenses are better than plastic lenses, but they are more expensive. Adjust the lens to concentrate the beam when you are using the laser. This will make the beam powerful enough to burn through some materials and ignite matches or paper. Be very careful when using this laser. Do not point it at anyone or anything that does not belong to you. The laser is very dangerous when focused. It is a crime to point the laser at aircraft and/or motor vehicles. Adjust the beam so that the laser is spread out. This will make the laser less powerful when hitting any one spot. This is the safest way to store the laser in case it accidentally gets turned on. Keep in mind that the laser can still be dangerous, however. It should never be within reach of children.",
      "The strength of a diode will be listed in microwatts (mW). The color of the diode will be determined by its wavelength (measured in nanometers, nm). A wavelength of 650 nm corresponds to a red laser, a wavelength of 405 nm corresponds to a blue laser, and  a green laser has a wavelength around 520 nm. Green lasers are the most expensive, followed by blue. Red is the cheapest. You can buy diodes online and sometimes at electronic supply stores. The diode costs can range anywhere from tens to thousands of dollars, depending on the laser you choose. If you aren't picky about the color, you can take apart an old DVD or Blu-Ray disk burner. There will be two diodes. Find the diode on the disk burning side. The one on the disk reading side is not strong enough to produce a burning laser. The diode will look like a small round light. It is likely encased in metal and will be positioned so that it can shine on the bottom of the DVD/Blu-Ray tray. Once you have located the disk burning diode, remove it from the DVD (or Blu-Ray) burner. You may have to remove small screws or cut the diode away from the rest of the burner. It is possible that the diode is encased in a metal casing. If this is the case, the casing can be left on the diode after you remove it."

      "You may be able to audition for a Broadway show if you live in a major city which is hosting auditions, but if you really want to make it on Broadway, you should live in New York.  You will be more available to your agent and have many more auditions available to you.  New York can be very expensive.  Be sure that you have savings to last you for several months once you arrive.  The average monthly rent on a 900 square foot unit in New York City is  $2815.  Add utilities and the higher cost of food, and you can plan on needing at least $3500 per month. Many people live on the outskirts of the city in Queens or Brooklyn, and some even live across the river in New Jersey.  These can be cheaper options than living in Manhattan, and the public transit system makes the commute quick, easy and cheap. Actor’s Equity Association, also referred to as Equity and AEA, is a union for actors in America.  It’s purpose is to provide protection for the professional actor and enforce guidelines regarding pay, breaks, insurance and other professional needs.  On the other hand, many professional theater companies will only use Equity actors, especially in leading roles, as a way to weed out actors with less experience.  In order to join you must first be eligible.  You may be able to join if you are cast in a production under an Equity contract. You may be allowed to join Equity if you are a member of one of their sister unions, SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, AGVA, or GIAA.  You must have been a member for at least a year, remain in good standing and have performed a significant role under their jurisdiction. You can register as an Equity Membership Candidate, or EMC, to earn credit toward membership by working at an Equity theater.  The cost to register is $100, and you must work at least 50 weeks in an Equity house to become eligible to apply for membership. Broadway stages often only work with talent agencies when they are looking to cast important roles for a Broadway show.  Using a talent agent helps streamline their process, since the agent will knows their actors and can submit only the people who they know could fit the role.  Having a talent agent is going to be necessary to getting in the door of a Broadway audition if you want a lead role.  Submit your headshot and resume to agents in New York City along with a cover letter. Ask other actors which agent they use and if you can use that actor as a reference in your cover letter. Invite agents to come see you perform when you are in a show. Your performance onstage is very important, but your behavior off-stage is just as important if not more important.  Broadway professionals and casting agents all work in the same circles.  It is likely that someone who has not worked with you will consult others asking about their experience working with you before they offer you a role.  Protect your reputation by being on time, following direction, and being respectful to everyone on the cast and crew. Emotions are a large part of theatrical work.  Do your best to keep the emotions in the performance and stay logical and collected when you are dealing with others off-stage.",
      "Even if you think you are born with the natural talent to be an actor, you will need some legitimate training to list on your resume and help you get jobs.  Find classes in your area to increase and practice your skills.  This is also a great way to meet other professionals and aspiring actors.  Consider a degree in theater from your local college or seek out classes at your local theater. Colleges with highly respected acting programs in New York include Juilliard, Columbia and NYU. Training programs are also available throughout New York City.  Some respected companies are HB Studios and Atlantic Theater Company School. Most of the shows on Broadway are musicals.  This means that not only must you be a good actor, but you will need skills in singing and dancing.  Find a dance school which offers training in all of the different styles of dance used on Broadway, including ballet, tap, and jazz.  The more well-rounded your dance abilities are, the better you will be able to adapt to the style of any show. Keep up with your dance practice.  You can begin to lose strength and flexibility if you don’t dance and stretch regularly. Once you can sing, dance and act, the theater world will deem you a “triple threat.”  You will be able to provide everything required of a Broadway actor.  The best way to train your voice is the personal attention of a vocal coach, who can find your range and fine tune your skills.  Look for coaches at your local colleges. Consider asking a music director to work with you personally. This will help you gain experience and build your resume.  Gaining experience onstage is important to growing as a performer, as well as creating a name for yourself.  If you are available for a role, take it and perform to the best of your ability, no matter the size of the part. The director is there to help you and the other actors come together to tell the story.  Listen to what the director says and perform your part.  Learn from every experience no matter how small the role may be. If the director is not giving much feedback on your performance.  Ask specifically for input.  Explore your role and ask questions about your character and performance.",
      "Headshots are photographs of your head and shoulders.  Actors are required to have both a headshot and resume when submitting for a role.  Headshot used to be black and white, but the current expectation is that headshots are full-color.  Make sure the picture is current and looks like you.  If you age or change your hairstyle, you will need to get new headshots.  Bring several different clothing options to the photoshoot and have pictures taken wearing different shirts.  Don’t wear distracting patterns or colors.  Keep your outfit simple so the focus is on your face. An acting resume should include your contact information, body specifications, experience, training, and special skills.  List your most recent roles first and work your way backward.  Your name should be at the top of the resume and in the largest font. If you are a member of an acting union list the abbreviation for the union after your name. If you have an agent, they will give you a stamp to add to your resume to replace your personal contact information. List your height, weight, hair and eye color, and make sure that it is accurate. Never lie on your resume.  Only list work you have actually completed. Find the auditions in your area and go to any which are offering a role you would fit.  Auditioning itself is a good way to continue working on your skills.  It is an opportunity to perform for influential casting directors and artistic directors.  You can find auditions through postings like backstage.com, on the “call board” at the AEA office, or your agent can search and submit on your behalf.  Be prepared to deal with a lot of rejection.  There are any number of reasons you may not be the best fit for a particular role, and there are a lot of other actors looking to make it on Broadway.  The competition is abundant and you will audition many times without being offered a role.  Treat every audition seriously.  Even if you are not a perfect match for this role you are auditioning for, you can impress the casting agent or artistic director who may then call you in for another role in the future. The best way for Broadway producers to see what you are capable of is to see you in action.  Perform onstage off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway on your way to Broadway.  Start making a name for yourself as a performer to get closer to Broadway. A bio, or biography, should consist of about four of five sentences and highlight your past work as an actor.  It is a little blurb which allows the audience to learn more about you and your career.  If you have a lot of acting credits, choose four or five of the top performances or roles, and mention that the ones listed are some of your favorite roles to date.  Although you will be writing the bio yourself, you should use third person vernacular like “he” and “she.” List your achievements, credits and performance history using full sentences rather than a literal list. You can include your training, and some personal information to endear yourself to the reader. You can also list film and television credits in a theatrical bio."

      "For the ice cream, you’ll need a 9 by 5 in (23 by 13 cm) stainless steel loaf pan that's about 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep.

      "Begin by shaping the risen dough into a circular shape. Use your hands to smooth it once it is round. The dough should still be plump on top and not flat. After it has been formed into a round shape, allow it to sit for a few minutes. Allowing it to sit will let the gluten relax, which will make the dough easier to shape. Take the heels of your hands and begin to flatten the circular shape into a rectangle. Use your hands to form four corners. The shape does not have to be perfect—it just needs to be recognizably rectangular. Sprinkle some flour under the dough if it sticks. Do not, however, use a lot of flour or the dough will not stick to itself when it comes time to fold it. Now that the dough is in the shape of a rectangle, fold a third of the dough on top of itself. Then, fold the bottom third down so that it overlaps the other layers. Pinch the dough where the layers meet to close up the gaps. Fold it in half again if the dough still seems loose. The dough needs to be taut to turn out well. Grease the pan with cooking oil or butter. If you are making white or wheat bread, use coarse cornmeal to prevent the dough from sticking. Gently roll the dough into the pan. The part with the seams should face down in the pan. The smooth, taut surface should be facing up. You are ready to bake the dough when it starts to rise slightly above the top of the pan. When that happens, slash a vertical line through the middle of the dough. This will allow the dough to rise evenly as it bakes. You can also use a razor blade if you don’t have a serrated knife.",
      "Take the risen dough and begin to form it into a spherical shape. When it has rounded out, smooth out the dough. The top of the dough should be plump and slightly rounded as well. It does not need to be perfectly shaped just yet. Once the dough has been rounded, push your fist into the center of the dough. Leave the indentation from your fist in the dough. Then, flip it over to the other side. Rotate the dough as you continue to shape it. Smooth it out as you continue to shape. Once you are satisfied with the shape, allow it a few minutes to rise before putting it in the pan to bake. Make sure that you grease the pan with cooking oil or butter before baking. If you are baking white or wheat bread, use coarse cornmeal instead of oil or butter. To create a Coburg loaf, begin with the rounded shape. Use a knife to make a deep cut down the center of the loaf. Make another cut in perpendicular to the first cut, forming a cross. Then, bake as usual. First, insert 2 to 3 fingers into the center of the loaf. Then, use your hands to push the hole outward on all sides. Once you’re satisfied with the size of the hole, smooth out the edges of the center hole. Put a towel over the loaf and allow it to rise for a few minutes before putting it into a pan to bake. To make a Cottage loaf, start with the rounded dough you’ve just created. Make another, slightly smaller, rounded dough ball. Put the smaller sphere on top of the larger rounded dough. Next, put 2 fingers through the center of a dough. Use a wooden spoon or dowel to extend the hole into the second dough. Put a towel over the loaf, and allow it to rise for a few minutes before putting it into a pan to bake. The holes will allow the 2 dough balls to weld together during baking.",
      "A “bloomer” means that the dough is in a cylindrical shape with slightly tapered ends. To achieve this shape, begin by rolling the dough out into the shape of a rectangle. The corners of the dough, however, should still be rounded. When you are done, the dough should be no longer than 14 inches (35.5 cm) and about 1 to 1 ½ inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) thick. Choose 1 side of the dough and begin to roll it vertically. Roll it on top of itself so that it becomes gradually thicker. It should be about 4 (10 cm) or 5 inches (12.7 cm) thick when you are done rolling. Tuck the ends to close up any space, and smooth out the dough when you are done rolling. Put the rolled-up dough onto a baking sheet that has been lightly greased. Put a kitchen towel on top of the dough. Allow it to rise for a few minutes. After it has risen a bit more, use a knife to cut slashes into the top of the dough. Cut diagonal marks that are about 1 ½ inches apart. Typically, you will be able to fit in 6 slashes."

      "Today, most school newspapers are created digitally.  Because of this, you will need to download and install some publishing software.  There are many different options available when looking for desktop publishing software.  Check out some of these examples of desktop publishing software to help get you started:  Adobe InDesign, Corel Draw, and QuarkXpress are all professional publishing software. Scribus is open-source desktop publishing software. You can make a newsletter using Microsoft Word or OpenOffice Some people find Google Docs to be a good solution, as it allows many people to collaborate on-line. Templates will allow you to quickly create the first edition of your newsletter.  A good template will also help you create new editions and give your newsletter a sense of cohesiveness.  You can either start with a pre-made template or create one of your own.  Most publishing software will include a number of templates for you to choose from. You can try searching on-line for free school newsletter templates. Templates allow you to easily add your own information or update old information. A good template will have spaces for both your articles and photos to go with them. You might want to make templates for specific months.  For example, you might have a template for February that has a heart theme because of Valentine's day. For text areas, it's a good idea to have predefined spaces for your title, headings, and the main body of text. Once you've built or found a template, you will want to customize it.  Customizing a template will let you add elements that you want to continue across all editions of your school newsletter.  Take a look at this list to discover some of the things you might want to add to your template:  Place the school name at the top of the front page. Add in a footer with page number, date, edition, or other information you might want to include. Putting your school logo somewhere on the front page can be a good idea. Include clip-art to give your newsletter an appealing and interesting look. You might want to have dedicated pages for certain content.  For example, you could put contact information for school staff on the last page of your newsletter. You'll likely want to decide the basic layout for articles and pages.  A simple two column layout can be a good way to start. After you've created and customized a newsletter template, you can begin to create content for it.  The content you create should strive to meet the goals of your newsletter and be appealing to your audience.  To help get you started, try reading over these examples of what a school newsletter might contain:  A calendar of the year and upcoming events. Current news. Upcoming activities or programs. Birthdays. Community news. Changes in school policy. It can be a good idea to add in fun things to your newsletter, such as puzzles or games.  However, the majority of your newsletter should be informative content.  If a piece doesn't seem to convey any information to the reader, you may want to consider rewriting it or removing it.  Always try to deliver the most information possible to your readers when publishing your school newsletter.  An opinion piece on the quality of cafeteria food might be nice.  However, it's probably a better idea to include a lunch schedule instead. Detailing the repair process of a restroom might be too much information.  It might be better to focus on things like how long the renovation took or how much it cost. Updates on school policies should always be included. You might want to highlight student achievements in your newsletter. It can be a good idea to have small articles that introduce new staff members. You don't have to create an entire school newsletter yourself.  Involving others can be a lot of fun for everyone.  With more people working on the newsletter, both the content and the quality can be improved.  Try asking students, staff or others to help create content or design the layout of your school newsletter.  Asking students to write articles can be a good way to let them express a student's viewpoint and get in some writing practice. Having staff write articles can result in more detailed or informative pieces.  For example, asking a math teacher to write about the new high-level math course would be a good idea. You might have students form a club around creating and publishing the newsletter. Asking for help with printing, publishing, or distributing might be necessary.  You can check with local school staff, send a request for volunteers, or check with local businesses.",
      "Before you get too far in planning your newsletter, it can be a good idea to consider the goals you have in mind for it.  Thinking about the goals that you want  your newsletter to achieve can help you build a successful newsletter.  Consider some of these aspects of a newsletter and decide what you want your own newsletter to achieve:  Should your newsletter focus on events or policies? Are you going to create and publish the newsletter on your own? Do you plan on building a team to publish the newsletter? How big do you want your newsletter to be? How many people do you want to reach with your newsletter? What should the newsletter be called? You will need to decide how often you want to publish your newsletter before you begin creating it.  Having a publication schedule can help you determine how often you'll need to work on the newsletter and when new issues are due.  Decide on a publication schedule before planning the rest of your paper to help make it successful.  If your school is either very large or very active, you may want to publish more often or publish larger papers, less frequently. If you are unsure of how often to publish, you may try publishing monthly to begin with. You probably won't need to publish any editions over the summer months if your school isn't active during them. When planning and creating a school newsletter, it can be helpful to keep your audience in mind.  The goal of your newsletter will be to inform and engage your audience.  Knowing your audience will allow you to write articles and content that is tailored just for them.  You'll likely want to include some sections or content for the students in the community. Your main readers are likely to be the parents and adults in the community. Your newsletter should also keep staff informed, describing current events at the school. You might also want to include content that supports your local community. Once you have an idea of what your newsletter will include, it's time to think of how you will deliver it to readers.  Having a plan in place for distribution will help you reach as many people as possible after your newsletter has been completed and printed.  It can also be helpful to think about the size of the school.  How many people do you need to reach?  Consider some of these distribution methods when deciding what's best for your newsletter:   It's important to remember that not everyone might be able to receive digital newsletters.  You will likely want to print out physical copies as well. Physical copies will either need to be delivered or placed in a public space that allows for people to easily pick up a copy. Digital copies will likely be the most cost effective option and will allow you to reach a large number of readers.",
      "If you are offering printed copies of your newsletter, you will want to make them easy to find.  Placing them in an area that doesn't see much traffic will likely result in less people reading the newsletter.  Sending them home in certain ways can work better than others.  Always make sure that your newsletter is easy to locate or is likely to be delivered successfully.  You'll likely want to create a list of people who want to subscribe to your newsletter. Try leaving it near the entrances to your school or local businesses. Bring some copies to your nearby library to put out for people to take. Leaving some copies on the front desk of the main office can be a good idea. If you have the budget, your school may mail printed copies to the community. Give the paper to students to take home.  Some have found that giving the newsletter to younger children increases the chances of it getting home. Digital publication can lower costs and increase the size of your reader base.  There are many methods that you can use to easily send your newsletter digitally to your readers.  Try using some of these methods to send your newsletter out digitally:  You can use group emails to send out your newsletter. You might post new editions on your school's homepage. Use your school's social media accounts to let people know about new editions of your paper. You could build a dedicated website or blog to post new editions of your newsletter. It can be a good idea to record and track some information about your newspaper.  Collecting this data will tell you how many people are reading it, how many copies are actually being used, or even what information people prefer to read about.  This information can help you create a better paper and will allow you to meet the needs of your readers.  Keep track of how many paper copies are taken by readers.  This can tell you if you need to print more or less copies in the future. Counting how many copies are taken from different locations will tell you where the best places are to distribute the paper. For digital versions, you can track how many people download the paper and from where.  This can help you learn if people are finding the paper on your school's homepage or from social media. You might include reader surveys that would allow for constructive feedback."

      "It doesn't have to be anything very obvious--maybe you start saying \"y'all\" instead of \"you guys\"--and notice if it starts popping up as part of his vocabulary. This is a way of subconsciously signaling you are on the same wavelength and try to get you to like him. If you have a slight accent, he may begin mirroring your accent without realizing it. Does she always keep things very light, with a lot of joking and talking about movies or a difficult assignment--subjects she'd probably discuss with anyone? Or has she begun to confide in you a little bit, telling you more personal things or getting really deep into her beliefs or hopes for her future? If so, she wants you to take her seriously and to build a deeper connection with you.  If she looks upset or you know she's had a bad day, make a point to let her know you're available to talk, and see if she confides in you. If conversations are somewhat surface, but she gets over-the-top excited when you have things in common, she's still trying to connect with you. So when your chat about movies reveals you both love Jason Statham and she is overjoyed, she's showing that she's a good match. Ask your friends if your name has come up in conversation and see if they can find out from his friends if he talks about you a lot. If he likes you, he's going to be curious about you and what makes you tick. So if he randomly asks your friend who is on her way to basketball practice \"Oh, isn't [your name] on the team, too?\", he's very interested in you.  If it turns out your name often comes up in conversation--maybe relaying something funny or interesting you said--it's a sign that you're on his mind. He may even tell mutual friends that he's really interested in getting to know you, hoping they'll tell you.",
      "One way to tell if a flirt really likes you is if he doesn't flirt with you. If he's a natural flirt, he's probably not putting too much thought into his actions when he's friendly with other people--that's just how he is. But if he clams up when you are near, acts fidgety and nervous and not really like himself, it could be because he is now very aware of his actions and is overthinking everything.  Watch him interacting with a group of people, then walk up and say hi. See if his behavior changes--if he gets quiet, tones down his goofiness, or doesn't say much but keeps glancing at you. See if one of your friends will join the group and try to embarrass him a little--nothing mean, just a small joke at his expense. If he blushes or gets embarrassed when he'd normally take the joke in stride, it might mean he doesn't want to look bad in front of you. If you make him nervous, he may continue to be very friendly with other girls and appear to ignore you or be less friendly toward you. Not every flirty person becomes nervous when around their crush, so if they're not suddenly getting shy, it doesn't necessarily mean they don't like you. They might be the type that will give you more attention instead. If she's interested in you, she will subconsciously copy your body language. When you're hanging out, try crossing your legs and see if she does the same a few seconds after. Take a drink of water and watch for her to also take a sip.   Mirroring a person's actions is a way to bond, get comfortable with each other, and send the signal that you like the other person, even if you're not even aware you're doing it.  If you decide to try this in reverse - mimicking her movements so she will subconsciously feel comfortable with you--make sure you don't follow too closely or precisely. Wait a few seconds before mirroring her actions. If she picks up on what you are doing, she may think you're mocking her and the effect will be ruined. Try to notice if she's constantly glancing at you across the room or when you're in a group, then blushing or glancing away when you catch her looking. When you're having a conversation, notice if she starts looking into your eyes as though she's studying them. Prolonged eye contact or a lot of quick glances in your direction indicates she's interested in you.  To see if she likes you, try holding her gaze while you're flirting. If she seems uncomfortable and looks away quickly, she's probably not interested in anything romantic. But if she stares back at you, it's a good sign that she's into you.  You can find out if she's watching you by taking a small action, like appearing to look at something strange out the window. If she's watching you, she won't be able to help but look out the window, too. When you're  with a lot of other people, does he seem to pick you out of the crowd? When you're having separate conversations with other people, does he suddenly chime in, alerting you that he's been paying more attention to what you're saying than the person he's talking to? If he likes you, he will constantly be looking for ways to be near you and interact with you.  Go out to dinner in a group and see if he makes sure he's sitting next to you. Try to hang out a few times in group setting, and notice if he makes a point to come talk to you each time. Go to a party and try to stay until the end. If he hangs around with you long after most people have gone, he probably went to the party just to talk to you."

      "If you and your partner have been having unprotected sex consistently for 12 months or more, then this is officially considered a fertility problem. Schedule an appointment with a fertility specialist if this is what you and your partner are experiencing.  Trying to conceive means that you aren’t using condoms or any other barrier methods, aren’t taking birth control pills or using patches, or using any other type of withdrawal or timing method to prevent pregnancy. Approximately 15% of couples trying to have a baby are unable to conceive in the first year, so you aren’t alone if you’re experiencing this problem. Many women experience increased fertility problems around their mid-30s because they have fewer quality eggs. If you’re over 35, then see a specialist if you’ve been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 6 months.  It’s common for couples over 35 to take 1-2 years to successfully conceive, so don’t panic if you’re having trouble. Fertility specialists see this all the time. If the doctor discovers that your eggs are declining in quality, then the doctor can prescribe a drug like myo-inositol to support your egg health. Fertility drops in both men and women after age 40, so conceiving may be harder for you. It’s best to contact a specialist right when you start trying to conceive. This way, you can increase your chances of success and having a healthy pregnancy.  If you’re trying to conceive over 40, the specialist may suggest a variety of methods, like scheduling sex around the woman’s ovulation period, to increase your chances of success.  You might not have any trouble at all conceiving at this age, which is great. But it’s still a good idea to see a specialist at the start because pregnancy can be more difficult for a woman older than 40. Age also increases a woman’s chances of having a miscarriage, so the doctor’s support is important through the whole process.",
      "Infertility could run in families, so it’s good practice to see a fertility specialist before you start trying if family members have had conception problems in the past. The doctor can assess this family history and determine if this might affect your chances of conception.  A family history of infertility is relevant to both men and women, so see the doctor either way. You might also have a personal history of infertility with a previous partner. Tell the doctor this as well. You might not want to talk about past partners around your current partner, but it’s relevant to the issue. Irregular menstrual periods could indicate a problem with your ovulation cycle, making pregnancy more difficult. If you don’t experience periods at all, then it’s likely that you’re not ovulating. See the doctor to address this issue and increase your chances of conception.  A typical menstrual cycle is 28 days, but it could be a few days longer or shorter. Having periods significantly before or after this timing indicates irregularity.  There are many causes of infrequent periods, including thyroid conditions, hormone imbalances, fibroids or polyps, dietary problems, diabetes, or excessive exercise. Most of these are treatable with lifestyle changes or medication. Women who have had more than 2 miscarriages may have trouble conceiving or completing a pregnancy. Talk to the doctor before you try to conceive to reduce your chances of another miscarriage.  A miscarriage is defined as the loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy. The symptoms include lower back or abdominal pain and cramping along with vaginal discharge and bleeding.  There aren’t specific actions you can take to prevent another miscarriage. The doctor will probably do an ultrasound to check for any growths in your uterus, then put you on a round of prenatal vitamins to support the pregnancy. Chemotherapy could cause infertility, so if you or your partner have had cancer and received treatment, then visit a specialist before your start trying to conceive.  Generally, the younger you were when you had chemotherapy, the better your chances of having no conception problems later on. The infertility could be a temporary side effect of chemotherapy or other cancer treatments. The doctor may suggest waiting a bit longer for your body to recover. Some sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) can cause infertility by leaving inflammation in your reproductive system. A specialist can provide medication or minor surgery to remove this inflammation, so if you or your partner have has STIs in the past, see a fertility doctor.  Common STIs that can cause fertility problems are chlamydia and gonorrhea. Most STIs don’t cause fertility issues if you caught them early and received treatment. Usually, only undiagnosed or untreated infections cause problems. Receive regular checkups and screenings to catch any infections early. While many people think about women when they hear “infertility,” some male conditions can also be the cause. If you’re a man trying to conceive with a partner, contact a specialist if you’ve experienced any of the following conditions.  Unusually small testicles Swelling or inflammation in the scrotum or testicles Past injury or the groin or testicles Prostate problems"

      "A horse that is very young, and thus small, may be mistaken as pony. However, a pony is not simply a young horse. Instead, it is a different type of equine.  A horse is usually fully grown once it is five to seven years old. However, it will grow very rapidly in its first year, reaching about 90% of its fully grown height in that year.  The age of a horse is usually determined by inspecting its teeth. To definitively determine the age of a horse, take it to a veterinarian. Your veterinarian will inspect the horse's teeth and determine its age. The biggest difference between a horse and a pony is the size. Equine animals are measured from their withers down to the ground. Horses and ponies are measured in hands. Each hand is the equivalent to 4 inches (10.2 cm), which is the approximate size of a grown man's hand. The abbreviation for a hand is \"hh.\" It stands for \"hands high.\" Technically, a horse has to be 14.2hh or higher when it's full grown to be considered a horse. Anything below that is a pony.  To measure an equine, place the end of a tape measure on the ground next to your horse or pony. Extend the tape measure up to the level of the withers. Once you get a measurement from the tape measure, you should divide it by 4. This will give you the number of \"hands high\" your horse or pony is. The withers is the point on a horse or a pony where the neck and the back join. Some small horse breeds are exceptions to the rule about horse size versus pony size. A good example are miniature horses. Miniature horses were originally bred as pets and, while very small, they are still categorized as horses. A miniature horse is no taller than 34 inches from the ground to the base of the last hairs of the mane. They come in either an Arabian build or a stockier quarter horse build. In addition, they come in a wide variety of colors, such as appaloosas and pintos, just as non-miniature horses do.",
      "Usually, if you know what breed the equine is, you can tell whether it's a pony or a horse. Some breeds have the word \"pony\" in the name, for instance a Shetland pony. This means that all equines in that breed are ponies, even if a few happen to be a bit taller than 14.2hh.  Quarter horses are all horses, even though some of them are shorter than a horse should be. Finding out the breed of a horse may be as easy as asking its caretaker what breed it is. You can also ask the animal's veterinarian what breed it is. A pony's body tends to be stockier than a horse's body. Stockier proportions usually mean ponies have better endurance for work tasks. Their bones are thicker, their necks are shorter and thicker, and they have thick heads with broad foreheads. Ponies usually have thicker coats than horses. Thicker coats make ponies more resistant to cold weather. In addition, a horse's mane is usually smooth and relatively thin, while a pony's mane and tail are usually thick and course. Spend some time with the animal, either walking it around or petting and brushing it. Ponies tend to be calmer than horses. They are also very smart, just as horses are. Perhaps this combination of calmness and intelligence is why they are so good with children. Horses and ponies also differ in what they are good at doing. Ponies, because of their strength, hardiness, and tough build, are good at working on a farm. They can pull twice their weight, while a horse can usually only pull half of its weight. Horses, on the other hand, can work on a farm but their strength lies more in carrying people. They are not as strong as a pony but they have good stamina and can be more skillful animals."

      "Some good exercises associated with tight thighs (and legs in general) include squats, lunges, deadlifts, kettlebell swings and several variations upon these exercises. Depending on what you're going for, and the resources available to you, it's good to pick some combination of strength training and isometric exercises, which only use your body weight as resistance. Consider joining a local gym, which may have several machines dedicated to exercising your legs. Doing squats is the best way to tighten not only your thighs, but your legs, buns, and abs. Do squats in different positions for different results. To do a squat, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and flex your legs until your thighs are at a 90° angle with the floor. Keep your back straight and your butt back. Then, stand back up to straight. Repeat this 20-50 times, doing sets of 10-15.  The sumo squat is a great way to tone your inner and outer thighs. To do this, take the widest stance possible, then squat as low as you can. Do this 20-50 or more times a day to see fast results. Another great one is the plie squat. This is great for toning. To do this, put your arms above your head like a ballerina about to do a plie, while keeping your legs together. Then extend one leg from your right or left side, step into a wider stance and squat. Do 20-50 repetitions per day. Lunges are a wonderful way to tone the lower body. To do lunges, stand with your hands on your hips and your feet together.  Extend one leg and step forward and squat with your left leg still behind you.  Repeat this as many times as you can on each leg.  Lunges will target and tone your thigh areas if done correctly. The great thing about lunges is that if you do do them consistently and correctly, you will see amazing results, as it takes more effort than doing squats.  If you have any sort of knee issues, lunges can be difficult. Squats are a bit easier on the knees. Butterflies are done on the ground with your legs in an almost seated position. Your knees should be parallel to your groin. From there, move your leg up and down locked in that position like a butterfly flaps its wings. Do this about 50 times on each side. You can't spot-reduce fat. Any activity or diet which burns fat from your body will burn that fat proportionately over your body, not specifically near the area or muscle group which has been worked. For instance, doing squats will not reduce the fat on your buttocks and legs before anything else. Squats will help reduce the fat on your whole body, however. Here are a variety of cardio exercises you can do that will help you lose fat and tone your thighs:  Jogging or running Burpees Dancing Yoga Pilates Swimming If you want to strength train with added weight, it's important to focus on doing a high number of repetitions with a low amount of weight. This is how to tone muscles. If you want to build muscles, you should focus on doing fewer reps with a higher amount of weight. An example leg workout for someone aiming for lean, toned legs might look like this:  Squats (with 10lbs dumbells): 3 sets of 12 repetitions. Lunges (with 10lbs dumbells): 3 sets of 12 repetitions. Single-arm kettlebell swings (with 10lbs kettlebell): 3 sets of 20 repetitions per arm. Farmer's walk on the balls of your feet (with 20+ lbs dumbells) 2 minutes walk around the gym. nclude upper-body exercises as well. Make sure that you are also constructing a workout for the rest of your body so that you don't end up with super-strong legs and a weak and poorly toned upper body. At least a little bit of cardio in your weekly routine will also help to improve your overall health and muscle tone. You will also be able to work out more and burn more fat if you incorporate other major muscle groups and exercises into your workouts, so be sure to build a full workout routine.",
      "If you want to tone your muscles and lose fat, you need to burn more than you take in. It's as simple–and as complicated–as that. To start out with, replace the snack food crackers, chips, frozen dinners, and other highly-processed pre-packaged foods with basic fruits and vegetables.  You don't have to stop snacking if you want to lose weight. But instead of reaching for a handful of chips, have an apple. Instead of munching on Cheetos, have a handful of grapes or almonds and berries. You can't out-train a bad diet. Even if you're working hard, you won't be able to tone your thighs if you're still eating junk. Chicken, fish, and nuts are all excellent sources of protein that are an essential part of building and toning out your muscles as you work. As you're working out, it's important to focus on getting plenty of lean proteins into your diet. 2-3 servings per day. As you're working aim for at least 5-6 servings of complex carbs per day. Brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, and whole wheat pastas and breads are excellent sources of carbs for your workouts. Complex carbohydrates take a long time to digest, meaning that they'll fuel your workouts and help you to lose weight. A lot of people are carb-conscious when it comes to losing weight, and that's fine. But it's quick-digesting carbs that you want to avoid, not complex carbs. Your body needs carbohydrates to function problems, so you can't avoid them entirely. It's important to spread your eating out throughout the day, having a variety of small meals and healthy snacks all day long to keep your metabolism high and working for you, instead of against you.  Instead of skipping breakfast, eating an energy bar at lunch and having a huge dinner, eat a full and healthy breakfast, and treat yourself to a handful of almonds and dried fruit when you're feeling hungry at 3 pm. This is a better way to lose weight than skipping meals. Never skip breakfasts. Eating in the mornings helps to energize your body and awaken your metabolism. Breakfast is an important weight loss tool. When you're hungry, drink a glass of water. When you're thirsty, drink a glass of water. Even if you're not thirsty, have some water on hand to make sure you're staying hydrated. People need up to two liters of water a day to stay fully hydrated. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need. Cut down alcohol. Did you know that a glass of wine is contain of as many calories as a piece of chocolate? If you regularly consume too much alcohol, you'll gain weight and it'll be very difficult to train away."

      "The cookies will float on top of the oil and fry quickly--less than 2 minutes. Don't walk away from the pot or they may burn or over cook.  Keep the cookies moving as they fry so they don't stick together. Allow the oil to heat up between batches, back to 375ºF (191ºC). Use tongs or a strainer to remove bits of batter that may be floating in the oil. Oil remains on the outer fried dough and won't reach the inside batter or cookie. Blotting excess grease will make this decadent treat slightly more healthy.  The oil provides the flavor and crunch of the cookie, so don't go overboard and soak up every last drop.  You can also drain the cookies on a wire rack, but using absorbent paper towel will remove more grease than letting it drip off on a wire rack. You can reuse the oil for deep frying (make sure to strain and remove any bits of batter floating around) or bring the oil to a donation point (often a waste management facility).   Never pour oil down the drain. It will block your plumbing.  If you can't find anywhere to recycle your cooking oil, make sure the lid is on tight and throw it in the trash or pour it over weeds.  If you plan to reuse your oil within the next few weeks, store it in a cold, dark place or the refrigerator so it will last longer.  If you don't have a funnel, pour the cooled oil into a paper cup, then pinch the top of the cup so you can easily pour it into the mouth of the sealable bottle or container. You can add a dusting of powdered sugar, vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate or caramel sauce, whipped cream, or any other garnish you'd like. Allow the cookies a minute or two to cool so your don't burn yourself, but do eat them while they're still warm! Keep finished cookies in an oven on low heat (about 200ºF or 93ºC) if you're doing a large batch so they will stay warm until they are served.",
      "The pot should be deep enough so the sides are at least 4 inches (10cm) higher than the oil. When deep frying, there should be enough oil to completely cover the food you are frying, but the pot should not be more than half way full of oil.  To fry, use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point and little to no flavor, like refined peanut oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil, or safflower oil.  If you don't have a heavy cooking pot, or one with a very thick, heavy bottom, you can use a wok or a deep sauté pan instead. Use a frying, candy, or thermocouple thermometer. These thermometers show temperatures up to 500ºF (260°C). To check temperature of the oil, hold it in the center of the pan. If your thermometer clips to the side of the pan it will be easy to keep track of the temperature as you work.  If you don't have a thermometer, stick a wooden spoon, skewer, or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the wood, it's hot enough for frying.  You can also use a kernel of popcorn to check the temperature. It will pop in oil that is 350ºF (178ºC), so you will know when it is close to optimum frying temperature.  If the oil begins to smoke, it's too hot. Carefully removed your pan from the stove to cool."

      "Requirements for a power of attorney are similar in most states, but some have special forms to fill out. To check whether or not your state has special forms for power of attorney, you can check here. If your situation is complicated, consider hiring an attorney to help you and your loved ones carry out the proper requirements for granting power of attorney. Usually, the document granting power of attorney must:  Clearly identify the principal (the person who is granting the power) Clearly identify the agent (the person who will have the specified powers) Specify exactly what legal acts the agent is entitled to perform Most states don't require government-written legal documents. However, in order to prevent any confusion and to make sure that both parties know exactly what authority is being granted, it's a good idea to use a state-issued form as a template. The specifics of the form will vary by state, and each state may have a different form for different powers. For example, Wisconsin provides different forms for a health care power of attorney and financial power of attorney. The form should include the full name of the “principal,” the person granting power of attorney. It should also name the \"agent,\" the person to whom the power is being granted. Alternate agents may also be named, in the event that the first agent is unable or unwilling to act on his or her authority. Make sure that you clearly and specifically identify the powers that are being granted to the agent, when those powers will take effect, and when (if ever) those powers will cease to have an effect. This is also the space where you will include whether the document is durable or springing if either is applicable. This will prevent confusion.   For example, instead of saying that the agent “has power over the principal’s finances,” say that the agent “has the power to withdraw money and make payments from the principal’s three bank accounts: bank account X, bank account Y, and bank account Z.” If the power of attorney is durable, it's especially important to make sure that the principal and the agent are in agreement about what responsibilities and authorities are being transferred. Make sure that the principal and agent know that some powers cannot be conferred under state law. If the power of attorney purports to transfer a power under state law that cannot be transferred, the power of attorney is void as to that power. For instance, even if the principal and the agent agree, the agent cannot write or execute a will for the principal. Any such will is not valid. In some states, it is necessary to have the signing of the document witnessed by one or two people. If this is the case in your state, make sure witnesses are not only present but paying full attention as the agent and the principal sign the document. The witnesses should be comfortable testifying as to the document’s authenticity.  For instance, in Florida, a power of attorney document must be signed by two witnesses, whereas Utah does not require witnesses.  Check here to find out if your state requires a power of attorney document to be signed by witnesses. If you draw up a power of attorney that hasn't expired, but you no longer want it to be in effect, you can draw up this form according to your state's laws to have it invalidated. Talk with your attorney to make sure it's done correctly. You can find more information at: How to Revoke Power of Attorney",
      "If you want your loved one to have the power to make decisions for you, talk to them about why you want them to have this control. Make sure you choose someone who will respect your wishes as your “agent,” or the person to whom you are giving the power.  If you want to get power of attorney over someone, the simplest way to do so is to get the permission of the person who may need to turn over his or her decision-making rights. If your loved one is terminally ill and knows that the time may come when he or she won't be able to make financial or medical decisions, he or she may decide to sign over power of attorney to someone else. In order for someone to grant power of attorney, he or she must be of sound mind. Talk to your loved one to make sure he or she understands what it means to sign over power of attorney, including what types of decisions will be made on his or her behalf.  If your loved one is already mentally incapacitated, but previously granted power of attorney to you or someone else in a living will, it is unnecessary to take steps to obtain power of attorney.  If your loved one is already mentally incapacitated and did not grant power of attorney in a living will, it may be necessary to obtain conservatorship, or adult guardianship, in order to legally carry out your loved one's affairs. If you believe that you should have control over the decisions of someone who is unable to make decisions for himself, you must go to the court and ask to be appointed as a conservator or guardian. To become a guardian of someone, they must be deemed “legally incompetent” by the court. That is, they must not be able to meet their own basic needs. If you believe that you know someone who can meet the criteria for incompetent, you may petition the court to be named guardian.   The district court in the county where the proposed ward lives has jurisdiction over the guardianship petition. Once the petition is file, the court will schedule a hearing where the proposed guardian must establish:  That he or she is eligible to serve as guardian That the proposed ward is incompetent That no suitable alternatives to guardianship are feasible   Any interested party, including the proposed ward, may challenge the guardianship petition. For example, if you believe that your elderly mother has dementia and you should be appointed guardian, you can file a petition with the court but your mother can challenge your guardianship, and you must then prove that she does in fact have dementia in order to become guardian.",
      "A financial power of attorney relates to the finances of the principal, meaning the person who grants the power to control his or her assets to the agent. You would have to provide this document to banks and other institutions where the agent needed to take financial action on behalf of the principal. A healthcare power of attorney enables someone to make medical decisions for a person who has become incapacitated. You would need to provide the document to hospitals, doctors, and anyplace else that the agent will need to make medical decisions for the principal. If you want to grant both financial and medical powers of attorney, remember that you do not need to same the same person as the agent in both circumstances. However, the two people will need to cooperate to act in your best interests, so choose people who can do so. ” A “durable” power of attorney goes into effect immediately. It also remains valid when the person who grants it becomes incapacitated.  For example, many seriously ill people choose a durable power of attorney because they want their agent to continue to make their decisions after they can no longer communicate their wishes, and, because of their illness, want the power of attorney to go immediately into effect. If the word ‘durable’ is not specified, the power of attorney is voided when the person who granted it becomes incapacitated. ” A “springing” power of attorney doesn’t go into effect until the principal’s specified date. For instance, if you want to grant someone financial power of attorney while you plan to be out of the country, you can specify that the document takes effect on the day you leave. You can also mix springing and durable powers of attorney. A springing durable power of attorney does not go into effect until the person who grants it specifies that it will go into effect (such as once the person becomes incapacitated) and will remain in effect through the person’s incapacitation. This does require that the agent show proof of the person’s incapacitation before the power of attorney will take effect. This type of power of attorney is not legal in all states, so make sure you check your particular state laws before attempting to draft a springing durable power of attorney. A general power of attorney may give the agent both financial and medical power of attorney. Ensure that you use the correct document for your circumstances. In some situations, such as with serious illness, a general power of attorney might make the most sense.",
      "Whoever you appoint as your agent will have the power to make financial and/or healthcare decisions for you. You want to make sure that you trust the person that you choose, and additionally, that they have the necessary expertise with regard to the financial and medical matters. Keep in mind that whoever you appoint as your agent will be making extremely important decisions in your stead. Consider the age, health and location of the potential agent. For example, if the agent does not live near you, it may be difficult for that person to have the required relationship with your banks (if the power of attorney is financial) or your doctors (for a medical power of attorney). While you should first and foremost choose someone who you trust, you want to make sure that the person will not refuse to carry out your wishes based on their own moral or religious views. Make sure that your agent could set aside any personal beliefs in favor of your wishes. For example, some people are very opposed to cardiac resuscitation, mechanical resuscitation, and artificial nutrition and hydration, while others strongly believe in these practices.",
      "An attorney may notice legal issues that people who aren't trained in legal matters would not think to include or leave out. For example, an attorney may notice that the document uses language that could been seen as ambiguous and could lead to confusion. Some states might not require you to have the document notarized. However, having the principal’s signature notarized eliminates any doubt regarding the validity of that signature. The notary must verify the identity of the principal before witnessing the signature. Notarizing the power of attorney document reduces the chance that it will be contested by an outside party who may question its validity. You can find more information about notarizing a document at: How to Notarize a Power of Attorney Financial institutions, such as banks and brokerage firms, do not want to inadvertently accept fraudulent power of attorney documents. They have requirements that must be met in order to accept the document and give the agent the powers listed. In order to make sure that your document is sufficient, show it to your bank and other financial institutions before signing it, to make sure that they will accept it after it is signed. A power of attorney is not filed at any governmental agency, but you must have it on hand to present it every time you use it. Keep it in a safe in your home or in a safety deposit box until the time comes when you need to bring it out."

      "Put a bit of rice flour into your palms and gently sift it over the main entry point into your home. This is a way of signaling to others that you are celebrating Onam and would welcome their visit. Wake up bright and early to take a bath. Then, put on your formal clothes for the day, often presented to you by the eldest female family member. Women will usually wear white sarees with a border of golden thread. Men will usually don a white dhoti with a border of golden thread. Throughout the entire Onam celebration and particularly on the final day, temples and cities may shoot off fireworks. Go to one of these locations and watch the show. The display might be modest or very extravagant, depending on the local budget.",
      "During the morning of the first day of Onam, known as Atham, seek out a temple. While you are there, pray for King Mahabali to make a safe return from the netherworld to modern-day Kerala. Walk alongside other revelers and make your way to the city of Thrippunithura near Kochi. Pray and leave offerings of food or small trinkets when you reach your destination. It is believed that the King left the world close to this location. This is a multi-colored floral carpet that most Indian families place at the entrance of their residence. The design will start out simple and become more complex and colorful over time. For this first day, arrange yellow flowers in a basic circular design. On the second day of Onam, known as Chithira, go through your house and scrub it from floor to ceiling. Remove any extra debris or trash from inside. Look over the exterior to make sure that it appears tidy as well. On the third day of Onam, known as Chodhi, go out shopping with your entire extended family. Look for jewelry or clothing pieces that you can give to others as gifts. The gifts do not have to be extravagant, especially if you plan to give them to multiple family members. The Onam sadhya is a large meal composed of 26 delicacies. On the fourth day of Onam, known as Vishakam, each family member is expected to contribute something to the creation of this meal. Go to the market to get basic ingredients or spend your time grinding up herbs and spices. The sixth day of Onam, known as Thriketa, is when you should travel to your ancestral home. Visit the house of your oldest living relative. Meet other relatives there and exchange gifts that you shopped for a few days prior. Throughout the seventh day of Onam, known as Moolam, travel around your neighborhood and enjoy miniature sadya meals with your neighbors. Alternatively, go to your local temple and enjoy a sadhya prepared by them for worshippers. For the eighth day of Onam, known as Pooradam, purchase miniature statues of Mahabali and Vamana. Walk these statues around your house in a symbolic way of welcoming them into your home. Then, place these statues in the center of your Pookalam design. As soon as the statue Mahabali is placed on the Pookalam you’ll start to call him Onathappan instead. The ninth day is known as Uthradam or Onam eve. Go out and buy any fresh vegetables or fruits that you’ll need for your sadya meal the next day. Look over your house once more to ensure that everything is clean and orderly.",
      "The banana leaf is the primary table setting for the Sadhya meal and all of the food items will be placed upon it. However, the leaf itself must be in proper position with the tapered end facing to your left. It should be near enough to you so that you can reach the food without stretching overly much. Depending on the Sadhya, it’s possible to have up to 24 dishes on your leaf over the duration of the meal. This means that you can get full really quickly if you try to eat everything. Instead, each time a course is brought out, focus on trying out each of these new foods.  The first course is usually a number of rice dishes. The courses alternate flavors from salty to spicy. Dessert dishes can be served at the very end or as a course right in the middle. It’s fine to go back and eat some of the foods from prior courses. But, do this only after you’ve eaten a bit from each of the more recent foods offered to you. After the last course has been served and you are done eating, gently grab the edges of the banana leaf and fold it from top to bottom. Keep folding until the leaf is now a small-ish packet and the food inside is fully contained. Pull the leaf towards you a bit. Not folding your leaf, or pushing it away from yourself, indicates that you did not enjoy your meal and is insulting for the hosts."

      "Try personal service and service by substitution first. Service by publication can only be performed if you have a written court order giving you permission to use this method. This method of service is very rare. In all likelihood, you will only be permitted to use it if you have already tried to serve the papers in every other reasonable way possible without any success. This is the name of the official court order permitting you to use this method of service. You must file an Application for Order for Publication of Summons and a statement of Declaration of Due Diligence to the court to obtain such an order.  The declaration is simply a statement regarding the efforts already made to serve the respondent. Tell the judge everything you know about where the other party might be. If you can show the court that the other party cannot be found, even if you know where the respondent should be, the judge may consider your request. If the judge accepts your request, he or she will order the notice to be published in a newspaper the judge selects for the order. After the notice has been published in the newspaper for the amount of time specified by the judge, the papers are considered to be served. The newspaper will then need to provide a sworn statement stating that the publication has been made as directed. You will still need to fill out and file this form with the court as usual. The court will attach the newspaper's sworn statement to the complete form, as well.",
      "If you are the petitioner—the party responsible for starting the case—you are not allowed to serve the papers. You must ask a third party who is unrelated to the case to do it for you.  The individual serving the papers must be 18 years of age or older. The individual must not have a direct interest in the case. In other words, he or she cannot be the petitioner or part of the respondent. You can ask a friend, relative, co-worker, or anyone else you know if that individual meets these basic restrictions. This individual may need to be approved by the court beforehand, though. Alternatively, you can hire a professional to serve court papers, instead. You can usually find these professionals listed under \"Process Servers\" in a phone book or business directory. You can usually ask the sheriff, marshal, or constable to serve the court papers for a fee, as well. If you are suing one individual, you only need to serve that individual. If you are suing multiple individuals, you must serve each person you are suing.   If you are suing a business partnership, serve one of the partners. Serve both partners only if you are suing the business and the partners separately. If you are suing a corporation, serve an officer of the corporation or their agent for service. If you are suing your landlord, serve the owner of the property you are renting. If you are suing the county, serve the county clerk. If you are suing the city, serve the city clerk. If you are suing the state, serve the Attorney General's office. The respondent must be in the state you file your petition in unless you are suing the owner of a property who lives outside of the state or the owner/driver of a car who lives outside of the state. The deadline for serving papers can vary by state, but usually, you must serve the papers to the respondent at least eight days before your court date.  In some instances, you may need to serve the papers up to 30 days before the court date. For instance, if you serve papers using substituted service to someone outside of the county, you must do so at least 30 days before the court date. Check with the court when you file your petition to find out what your deadline is. Typically, papers can be served any day of the week except for Sunday. Petitions that include an order of protection can be served all seven days of the week and must be served 24 hours before a court date. In most instances, there will be plenty of time in between the date you file your petition and your scheduled court date. If you do not already know where the respondent is, you will need to find that party yourself or hire a process server to do the job for you.  If you are unable to find the respondent, you must give the judge a written list of all the methods you attempted to locate and serve the other party. Include as many details as possible, including dates and places you went to in an attempt to find the respondent. If you can prove that you have made every reasonable effort to serve the papers, the judge may set a new date for the case and ask you to try further, or he/she might give you permission to serve the papers in another way (mail, substitution, or publication). When you file your petition, there are a few papers you will need to take with you when exiting the courthouse. These are the papers you need to serve to the respondent.   A \"summons\" or \"order to show cause\" tells the respondent to appear at court on a certain date. You will also need to serve a copy of the petition you filed. If there has been a temporary order of any kind, that paper must also be served to the respondent. Note that you will receive a \"Proof of Service\" or \"Affidavit of Service\" form, as well, but this form will not be served. A \"Proof of Service\" form is a legal document that shows the court that you did your duty in serving the papers correctly. This form must be filled out after you served the papers and submitted to the court before your case. An example of a \"Proof of Service\" form is here: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pos020.pdf  The form must include the location and date on which the papers were served. You must also indicate who the papers were served to and provide a physical description of that person. The name and address of the person who served the papers to the respondent must also be provided. Typically, this form must be notarized. The individual who served the papers must sign it in front of a notary public. The respondent does not need to sign the form, however. Give the original completed form to the judge when you go to court. Note that in some states, like California, you must file the form with the court at least five days before your court date.  Keep a copy of the form for your own records, as well.",
      "If the server has done all in his or her power to serve the papers directly to the respondent and has been unable to do so, your server can hand those papers over to a party that can legally accept them on the respondent's behalf. A competent adult, age 18 or older, who lives at home with the respondent can usually accept the papers. Similarly, an adult who appears to be in charge at the respondent's workplace or an adult who seems to be in charge where the person receives mail can usually accept the papers, as well. When passing the court papers to a substitute, your server must leave that substitute with specific instructions regarding what the papers are and what needs to be done with them.  Make sure that the substitute knows that he or she is receiving court papers for a specific individual. The respondent must be named, and the substitute must be told to deliver the papers to the respondent. Get the substitute's name when you leave the papers. If the substitute refuses to provide a name, write down a thorough physical description of the substitute. When you serve papers by substitution, you must also mail another copy of all court papers by first-class mail. Address the package to the respondent.  You need to send the papers to the same address the server left the papers at. Afterward, the server must fill out the \"Proof of Service\" form as usual. In addition to this form, a \"Proof of Mailing (Substituted Service)\" form must also be filled out by the server.  Get both forms from the server after he or she fills them out. File them both together at the courthouse on or before your court date. Provide a postal receipt with your forms indicating that you sent a second copy of the papers through the mail.",
      "Personal service requires you to know the more about the location and habits of the person you're serving than the others.  Since most people don't like to be sued, they will delay dealing with a potential lawsuit as long as possible, and will go to great lengths to avoid service.  It will save you time and money if you can tell your third-party service agent where the target of the lawsuit might be and when they might be there. The server must give a copy of your court papers to the respondent in person. He or she must walk up to the respondent, state, \"These are court papers,\" and hand the respondent copies of all the papers related to your case.  The respondent may refuse to accept the papers. If this happens, the server should leave the papers near the respondent and walk away. Doing so will satisfy the requirements, even if the respondent continues to refuse the papers or throws them away. Personal service is the preferred method of service and should always be attempted before other methods are used. After passing the court papers to the respondent, the server should fill out the necessary form and sign it in front of a notary public. This form should then be filed with the rest of your court documents at the courthouse.",
      "In most states, you can pay the court clerk a small fee to mail the court papers to the respondent via certified mail or first-class mail, depending on which service is required for the type of papers being served.  The fee you pay is usually low and can be recovered if you win the case. In some states, like California, service by mail must be made through the court clerk and you will be unable to mail the papers yourself. Check on your own state laws regarding this type of service to determine what the restrictions are. In some states, like Michigan or Arizona, you might be permitted to send the papers to the respondent without going through a court clerk. If this happens, those papers should be mailed via certified or registered mail, and you must request a return receipt.  That receipt must be signed by the respondent to the petition. Note that certified mail is required when you are serving a paper that opens a case. If you are serving additional papers related to the case after that fact, you can usually opt for first-class mail. If you pay the court clerk to send the papers, he or she must fill out the form. You will likely receive a copy and the court clerk will keep the original for the case records. If you live in a state that permits you to mail the papers yourself, you will need to fill out the form and file it as usual. Note that you will also need to include a copy of the signed receipt of delivery when filing the form with the court. Even though service by mail can be convenient, there is some chance that the judge will not accept this method of service unless strict guidelines are followed. In fact, roughly 50 percent of court papers served by certified mail are rejected.  The judge must be able to read the signature on the certified mail receipt. That signature must belong to the respondent and no one else. If the respondent refuses to sign the certified mail receipt with his or her full name, that receipt cannot be accepted as proof of service."

If the auxiliary cord is not near the stereo, then check in the glove compartment or centre console. Generally a 2–3 foot (0.61–0.91 m) cable (.6-.9m) is plenty long and should only cost about $5 to $10.   This button may also be labeled “CD” or “Source” on some stereos. Your stereo’s display will indicate which mode it is set to.  If you are having trouble finding the right button, check your car or stereo manufacturer's user guide. Set the volume to about 50% or less. It is better to have the player’s volume lower to conserve battery and minimize clipping and distortion in your music.. You will want to use the volume knob to reach a comfortable listening level. This is generally easier to adjust while driving and likely a more powerful amplifier than the one on your mp3 player. You will hear the music from your MP3 player come through your car’s speakers. You may need to further tweak the volume to your liking.",
      "Both ends of the cable must be firmly seated in their jacks to ensure optimal audio quality. Try to avoid pinching the cable at sharp angles to maintain the cable. If your player is frequently running out of battery while in use, you can get a car adapter to connect to the car charging port. Most modern adapters will have a USB port so that you can provide your own charging cable that is sure to fit your device. Charging adapters connect to both the car and player separately from the aux cable, although some car adapters may also include an aux connection. The car stereo has its own equalizer settings that may conflict and reduce sound quality. On an iPod Touch or iPhone, go to “Settings > Music” and tap EQ under the “Playback” header, then tap “Off”. Accessing the EQ settings will vary depending on the model of MP3 player you are using."

      "Writing your life’s story can tell you a lot about who you are as well as how you view your life’s challenges, joys, opportunities, and struggles. Writing out your personal story can give you insight into what you have learned through your experiences and how those experiences have affected you. In this way, you can analyze how your experiences helped shape who you are, which encompasses your values, attitudes, beliefs, biases, reactions, and the way you interact with your world. Once you’ve written the story of your life, analyze yourself by asking the following questions:  What are the themes that are present in your story? Are you always being saved or are you the person who saves others? Does your story have a theme of helplessness or ability? Is your story a love story, a comedy, a drama, or something else? If you titled your story, what would the title be? Divide your story into chapters. Why are the chapters divided where they are? What changed? What did you learn? What are the titles of your chapters? Did you label yourself in your story? Did you label others? What do those labels mean to you and what do they say about how you see yourself, others, and the world? What kinds of words do you use to describe yourself, others, and the world? What do these descriptive words tell you about your story and how you lived it? Once you write your story, you need to decide what it means. The interesting thing about writing your own story for analysis, which is called narrative therapy, is that is shows you what you think is important or crucial to your existence. It showcases those moments in your life that you feel are important or worth note. It also shows you how you view yourself and the trajectory of your life so far. For example, if you write your life as a drama, you may feel that your life is more dramatic and intense. If you wrote it as a comedy, you may think your life has been fun and upbeat to this point. If you wrote your life as a love story, maybe you are a hopeless romantic who either has great love or is hoping for one in the future. Even when you have followed all of these steps, you need to realize that it can take time. It is important to understand that becoming more aware of who you are, or analyzing yourself, is also an ongoing, lifelong pursuit. Who you are today or what you believe today may change in the future.",
      "Your thoughts are an integral part of who you are. They often guide how you feel as well as your attitude and perceptions of situations. Monitor your thoughts and recognize the content. Are your thoughts negative? Do you put yourself down, or always think something will go wrong? Which areas of your life are you most hard on yourself? Do this in every aspect of your life. You want to make sure you think about your thoughts every day and during all different kinds of activities. To help you keep track of your thoughts everyday, start a journal and write about your day, your struggles, your goals, and your dreams. Analyze your journal entries and take note of their quality. Are the hopeful or bleak? Do you feel stuck or powerful? Continue to analyze your thoughts to become more aware of who you are. Sometimes our perceptions of situations lead us to make faulty conclusions about what happened or what we saw. For example, if you perceived that your friend was mad at you after lunch, you may be confused and automatically think that because her mood was low, you did something wrong. Becoming aware of your perception of her mood can help you to analyze why you jumped to the conclusion she was mad at you. When you have a situation like this, take time to analyze your actions and beliefs about what occurred. Write down what you saw, heard, or felt that made you interpret the situation in the way that you did. Ask yourself if there could be other causes for your friends mood or if there are outside factors that you are unaware of. Your feelings can also give you clues into who you are and why you react to certain situations or people in the way that you do. Analyze your feelings by becoming aware of your reactions to topics of conversations, tones of voices, facial expressions, and body language. Identify what you are feeling and ask yourself why you had this type of emotional response. What were you responding to? What about it made you feel the way you do?  You can also use physical cues to tune you into how you are feeling. For example, if you notice you are breathing heavier or faster, so may be stressed, mad, or afraid.  If you can't figure out exactly how you feel at first, keep writing down your reactions and thoughts about certain situations. You may need time and distance from a situation to recognize how you feel. You also can ask a trusted friend or family member to help go over your thoughts and reactions to help you figure out exactly what you feel. It may be hard for you to distance yourself enough from the ideas to truly know how you feel or what these things mean about you.",
      "Knowing what you value can give you insight into who you are at your core. Many values are based on your personal experiences, and some change as you learn more about yourself. Sometimes values are hard to identify because the term and concept is abstract and often vague. Your values are your beliefs and ideals that you base your choices on throughout life. Identifying and defining your values will bring you closer to realizing who you are and what is important to you. In order to seek out your values, you will need to spend some time in reflection, analyzing what is important to you and which values make you who you are. Begin identifying your values by writing your answers to the following questions:  Identify two people you most admire. What are the qualities they have that you admire? What is it about this person that makes them admirable to you? If you could only have three of your possessions for the rest of you life, which would they be? Why? What topics, events, or hobbies are you passionate about? Why are these things important to you? What is it about these things that make you passionate? What event made you feel the most complete and fulfilled? What about that time made you feel this way? Why? You should start to have an idea about what is important to you and what you value. Try to group these ideas, moments, or things into core values to help you have a better idea of your core beliefs and ideals. Some examples of core values include courtesy, honesty, optimism, confidence, friendship, achievement, faith, friendship, kindness, justice, trust, and peace.  Use these core values to understand and know yourself better. These values should help you make choices and identify what is important to you. Through analyzing yourself in this way, you are that much closer to unlocking your true self.  Your may have multiple groups of values. This is normal because humans are complex and feel many different things. For example, you may value honesty, faith, competence, and confidence, values that don't necessarily group together. But these traits show you the kinds of situations and people you value around you as well as traits you likely strive for in yourself."

      "Many sites have calculators that will automatically tally up the energy efficiency of your house. It is also helpful if the site can also produce a graph or tally that can demonstrate what your house's potential could be after making some minor changes. ” Most electronic devices and appliances draw energy when they’re plugged in -- even if they’re switched off. Most Americans own 25+ electronic devices. You can cut your energy consumption by unplugging your appliances and devices when they’re not in use.  You can also plug appliances and devices into power strips. Switching the strip off will prevent them from drawing power. Set your computer to “sleep” or “hibernate” when you’re not using it. You can pick up right where you left off when you come back, but your computer will use a lot less energy. Old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs waste up to 90% of their energy as heat. New types of light bulbs, such as compact fluorescent (CFL) and LED bulbs, can dramatically slash your house’s energy consumption for light. In most cases, you don’t have to do a thing to your existing light fixtures. Just buy different bulbs and swap them out!  CFLs are like the fluorescent bulbs in supermarkets, but they’re shaped in a small coil and are about the same shape and size as incandescent bulbs. They last about ten times as long as an incandescent bulb. They’re usually a little bit more expensive, but they pay for themselves within a year. CFLs are a good choice for most home lighting situations. However, they usually cannot be dimmed, and they waste a lot of their energy when used in recessed or “can” lights. Because CFLs contain a small (but rarely dangerous) amount of mercury, they must be disposed of carefully. The Environmental Protection Agency has full instructions on their website.  LEDs last up to 35 times longer than an incandescent bulb, and between 2-4 times longer than CFLs. LEDs are cool to the touch, so they don’t use much energy at all. However, they are usually still more expensive than either incandescent or CFL bulbs.  LEDs are a good choice for most home lighting situations. Unlike incandescent and CFL bulbs, LEDs emit “directional” light, meaning the light is focused in a specific direction (like a spotlight). They are a great choice for recessed lighting. Only Energy Star-certified LED bulbs are specifically designed to replicate the omnidirectional light of a traditional light bulb. Look for the Energy Star label to make sure that the LED bulbs you buy give you the look you want. Even better, open curtains and windows during daylight hours to use natural light. This can really cut power costs and also save loads of energy. Many things we throw away on a daily basis can be  composted instead. Coffee grounds, fruit and vegetable peels, eggshells, even napkins and paper towels can be recycled to produce compost, which is great for gardens.  Keeping food scraps out of landfills is good for the environment! It keeps them from building up methane gas (which is a major part of global warming) as they decompose in plastic trash bags, and it helps reduce the amount of waste in landfills. Even if you live in an urban area, you can keep a compost bin on a balcony or porch. Many online retailers sell ready-to-go compost kits. 80-90% of the energy used when you run your washing machine comes from heating up the water for hot-water washes. Use the “cold water” or “eco” mode on your washing machine to save energy.  Several companies, such as Tide, make eco-friendly cold water detergents. If your laundry has tough or frequent stains, these could be a good option to help your clothes get clean even in cold water.  Look for natural detergents and stain removers, if you can. These are usually plant-based and biodegradable, making them much more eco-friendly. Most kids probably learn to brush their teeth while the water is running. Since dentists recommend that you brush your teeth for a full two minutes, that can add up to over 5 gallons of wasted water every time! Brush your teeth with the water off, and just turn on the tap to rinse. If you have ceiling fans, use them whenever possible to keep cool in the summer. Air conditioners can cost up to 36 times more to run than a ceiling fan. In the United States, air conditioning accounts for more than a quarter of the average home’s electricity use.",
      "If your house is older, your windows probably allow air to seep in. Single-paned windows don’t insulate as well as newer models. You can save up to $465 a year by replacing old single-pane windows with energy-efficient ones. In the U.S., several tax credits are available for replacing old windows with energy-efficient models. The US Department of Energy has a full list of these credits here. When chosen wisely, a skylight can provide beautiful natural light to your home while reducing your energy consumption. It’s important to consider your home’s position in order to maximize your skylight’s benefits. Consult a designer or architect. An eco-friendly skylight is more than a hole cut in the roof with some glass in it. Many energy-efficient skylights exist on the market, but they should always be professionally installed to make sure that they are safe and efficient. Hardwood floors add value and beauty to a home, but many of the trees used in hardwood flooring take years to grow. If your house is up for a new floor, consider using sustainable materials such as bamboo instead. Bamboo grows very quickly and takes less land to produce, but it’s still attractive and durable. Cork is another sustainable wood flooring option. Cork is softer than bamboo, so it absorbs noise and feels cushiony underfoot. It is sometimes less durable than bamboo. Shade trees can reduce the amount of energy you spend to cool your house on hot summer days. If your property doesn’t already have shade trees, this is a step that will take some time before you see the full benefit.  In addition to providing shade, trees absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide and release oxygen. A single tree can produce enough oxygen for four people in a single day.  If you’re building a new construction home, try to work around existing trees. You could even incorporate them into your house design, such as building a deck under a huge shady oak. Place deciduous trees (trees that shed their leaves annually) near the south and west sides of your home. This will help them block harsh afternoon sunlight in the summer, but let sunlight reach your home during the winter. ” Cool roofs reflect sunlight rather than absorbing it. This helps reduce your home’s energy consumption. It can also extend the life of your roof. These roofs are especially good for people who live in hot climates, since they reduce the need for air conditioning.  Cool roof coatings are available at many home supply stores and warehouses. These coatings are like extremely thick paint and can be applied fairly easily. They are usually white or very light-colored with reflective pigments that reflect, rather than absorb, sunlight. (It is not recommended to apply cool roof coatings to shingle roofs.) If you have a steep-sloped shingled roof, consider replacing your current shingles with cool asphalt shingles. These shingles have specially fabricated granules that reflect sunlight. If you have a metal roof, it already reflects a lot of sunlight. However, these roofs absorb a lot of heat, which can increase your energy consumption in the summer. Painting your metal roof with a light color or using a cool roof coating can increase its energy efficiency. Composting toilets usually do not use water to “flush” like traditional toilets. They can also recycle many types of human waste into fertilizer that can be used in agriculture. While they are initially more expensive to install than traditional toilets, they are far more eco-friendly and will eventually pay for themselves. Composting toilets are usually easiest to install and maintain in a rural or suburban setting. If you live in an apartment or urban high-rise, it may more difficult to install and maintain a composting toilet. Materials such as cedar naturally repel pests and water. They are also durable and low-maintenance. Replace old aluminum siding with a more sustainable option. There are other eco-friendly siding options, such as fiber cement board and particle board. These are durable and sustainable. Look for products that have been manufactured without formaldehyde. ” If you are designing a new home or doing extensive renovations on an older home, consider talking with a design team about a “whole-house systems approach.” This extensive approach considers many factors about your home, including local climate, your site’s specific conditions, your appliance needs, etc. Because it takes all these factors into account, a whole-house systems approach can drastically reduce your energy consumption. Many designers and architects have experience in whole-house systems approach construction. Visit the National Association of Home Builders for more advice on finding a design team.",
      "A programmable thermostat can monitor your house temperature, keeping it warmer or cooler when you’re not there. For example, if you’re away during the day at work, a programmable thermostat can keep the inside temperature warmer than you’d usually keep it, and trigger the A/C only when you get home. Using one properly can save you up to $180 a year. Do some research before investing in a programmable thermostat. If yours isn’t easy to use, it might not end up saving you money or energy. Your old appliances, such as water heaters, refrigerators, and stoves, could be wasting a lot of energy. Replacing them with Energy Star-qualified products will ensure that your home uses less energy.  There are often tax credits for replacing old, energy-inefficient products with new eco-friendly ones. The US Department of Energy has a full list of these credits here.  If you can’t afford to replace your water heater, buy a specially designed insulating blanket and wrap it around the water heater. These blankets are available at most home improvement stores and take only a few minutes to install. This will help reduce wasted energy. Traditional toilets can use up to 7 gallons of water per flush. These water-guzzlers create a lot of waste. Look for “low flow” toilets to be eco-friendly. Look for toilets with the WaterSense label. These toilets use about 20% less water per flush than standard toilets. Showers account for about 17% of the average American’s indoor water usage. Swapping your old showerhead for a \"low flow\" or water-saving showerhead can reduce your water consumption by up to 2,900 gallons a year. Look for showerheads with the WaterSense label. These showerheads have been approved according to Environmental Protection Agency standards. A lot of energy can seep out through your attic and basement. Insulating these areas can reduce your home’s energy consumption. It can also cut your heating and cooling bills by making it easier to maintain a consistent temperature inside. GreenFiber cellulose insulation is an eco-friendly alternative to traditional insulation. GreenFiber is made of shredded recycled newspapers. It can be blown through small holes into walls, so it is easy to use when you’re remodeling. You can find a dealer at their website. Rather than buying new furniture, consider hitting up thrift shops and websites such as Craigslist and Freecycle. Recycling an old treasure rather than buying a new piece can save trees and your wallet. Traditional paints contain damaging volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can continue being emitted into your home’s atmosphere for 5 years after painting. Look for paints that are plant-based and water-borne. If you can’t find plant-based paints, try to find paints that are labeled “VOC-free.” Many large paint manufacturers, such as Benjamin Moore, produce VOC-free paint. If your budget won’t allow for replacing older, inefficient windows, insulating them can be a good option to make your home more energy efficient. It’s easy to insulate your windows and keep your home cozy year-round.  Use caulking and weatherstripping around windows to stop air from seeping in (or out). This can cut heat loss in the winter and keep you cool in the summer. Thermal or light-blocking window treatments can also help reduce energy waste by blocking sunlight. This is particularly helpful in hot climates.  Make sure to use draught-stoppers at the bottom of doors, too. You can buy these at many retailers, or  make your own. Motion-sensing lights are quite common outdoors, such as near garages or walkways. However, you can also install inexpensive motion sensors indoors. These will turn the lights on when you enter, and off when you leave a room. This could be very helpful if you have a hard time remembering to switch off the lights when you leave. You can buy a variety of solar-powered outdoor lights, from high-powered driveway floodlights to small walkway lamps. If you live in an area that gets a lot of sun during the day, these are a great way to cut your energy consumption and still have the lights on. Most home improvement stores will have a variety of solar lights, but you can also find them at many online retailers. Solar energy is clean and renewable. With many panels, surplus energy can be transferred to a battery and stored for later use. Installing solar panels can reduce your home’s carbon footprint, on average, by 35,180 pounds. That’s equivalent to the carbon dioxide absorbed by 88 trees. Investing in solar power will require some upfront cash, but it will pay off in the long run, for you and the planet.  In some locations, you can even sell surplus solar energy to the local power grid. Solar panels need to be wired into your home’s existing electrical grid. It is best to leave installation to professionals. Many U.S. states and countries offer tax incentives if you install solar panels."

      "Fleshing and Stretching the Pelt",
      "Casing the Fur"
    ],

      "Flesh-scrapers and stretching boards are about as primitive a tool as you can get, but it's still the most effective way for getting the flesh, cartilage, and fatty bits off of the pelt so that it can dry thoroughly.  A flesh scraper is basically what it sounds like: a short and sharp blade that's used to scrape the flesh away. In a pinch, you could use a big kitchen knife that's somewhat dull, but it might be a little more difficult than with a scraper. Hog scrapers, single and double-handed scrapers are all common. Metal and wooden boards are both commonly used for the job. If you use a wooden stretching board, you'll also need staples or push-pins to secure the pelt when you're ready to stretch it for drying. Wooden stretching boards can double as \"fleshing boards,\" providing a nice surface to scrape the pelt on. If you have a metal stretcher, you'll just need to use a bench, table, or other flat surface on which to scrape the pelt. It's usually recommended to let the fur alone to firm up the fat some in a cool environment (about 55 degrees F, or 13 C). This will help to make the scraping job a lot easier. You can flatten out the pelt onto the board, fur side down, to let it dry for several hours before you get started scraping. When you start, the whole process of scraping itself shouldn't take more than 15 or 30 minutes. Using firm pressure, carefully scrape the fat and connective tissue away from the skin using the scraper. There's not much of a secret or a science to it–you're basically just scraping. Be gentle to avoid tearing through the skin, but be firm enough and even enough to get everything off. The tail is usually the most challenging part, so most trappers will start there, spending the most time making sure that every bit of fat is evenly scraped away. After removing the fat from the tail, scrape directly up the middle of the pelt, in a stripe. Go all the way up until you've scraped everything off a narrow strip up the middle of the pelt, and the head of the pelt. Then go back and scrape outward, extending evenly to the sides. This will help start the stretching process and flatten out the pelt. Keep using even pressure and slowly scraping off all the fat and other bits as you work. It shouldn't take that long, but be thorough. If you miss anything, you risk ruining the pelt with rot. Metal stretches are usually one-peice mechanisms that allow you to secure the pelt easily without additional tools. With a wooden stretching board, you'll typically need to use push-pins or staples to stretch out the pelt.  Stretch the pelt tightly, so it flattens out and looks clean, but not so stretched that it thins out the skin and makes it look weak. It'll also shrink some while it stretches, so you want to make sure it'll be able to comfortably. The pelt should be starfish-stretched out, all the limbs and the tail taut and extended. Don't let the arms hang loosely, or the pelt won't look right. 55 to 60 degrees F (13 to 15 degrees C) is the perfect drying environment for a pelt. Make sure it's free from sunlight and temperature fluctuations. Depending on the climate, pelts should hang for anywhere between a day and a week. You'll know it's done when the skin is firm and taut, with a plastic-like touch.",
      "When you've acquired game the primary goal of which is the pelt, there are two basic methods of proceeding. Casing refers to removing the pelt from the carcass, starting around the back feet and working forward, pulling it off in one big piece. This is the best way to proceed. It's not usually recommend that you attempt to remove the organs first, which can ruin the valuable pelt. Open-skinng is typically only used on beavers and a few other animals. This involves removing the organs first, via a vertical slit up the torso of the animal, then removing the pelt and the tail at once. This isn't recommended for raccoons. Raccoons have a reputation for acquiring a lot of dirt, since they're scavenging creatures, which means you'll need to take a bit of time to clean them before getting started. Hang the carcass from a skinning gambrel by the feet, hooked through the tendon just behind the ankles to clean them.  If the raccoons appear to be fairly clean, run a hairbrush through the fur in the direction of the tail, end, to get out any debris, twigs, and dirt that might be difficult to see. If the raccoon seems clean, it's ok to start skinning. If you've got a muddy raccoon, hose it down until the water runs clear,  hang them by a front foot and hose them down until they run clear water, then let dry thoroughly before starting. If at all possible, it's best to avoid this, because the stiff bristles of the raccoon fur can become a lot more pliable and (to some people) less desirable if you rinse it. To get started, make a cut through the pelt between the legs of the animal, from the inside of one ankle to the next. Think of it like the inseam on a pair of jeans, connecting your cut from one ankle to the next in a \"V\" shape. \"Cuff\" the incision by running your knife around both \"ankles\" of the raccoon, loosening the skin. This will allow you to start pulling the skin down clearly.    {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Skin-a-Raccoon-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Skin-a-Raccoon-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Skin-a-Raccoon-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/aid1980270-v4-728px-Skin-a-Raccoon-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Cut about an inch or so in diameter around the anus, starting at the base of the tail, where it connects to the body. Obviously, it's usually best to wear gloves at all times when you're skinning raccoons. Be very careful at this point not to cut too deeply and cut into the meat. The last thing you want to do is puncture the intestines right around the anus, which can taint the fur and the meat, if you want to use it. Run your knife all the way down the length of the tail in a straight line. To keep the pelt as neat as possible, it's important to use caution and be very exacting in your cut. Go slowly and pull the tail taut while you run it straight from the base to the tip.  For some raccoons, depending on the size, it may be difficult to get all the way down to the tip of the tail. It's common to go about halfway, then use a tail-stripper to hold the fur in place while you pull the tail up and out of the fur. To use a tail-stripper, you'll probably have to work the fur down the hind legs and around the hips to expose the base of the tail more easily to get it started. Tail-stripers are common tools that are used in skinning foxes, raccoons, and other animals, and are available at most outdoors outfitters. If you've ever skinned a rabbit, the pulling the skin down a raccoon is similar, but a little more tenacious. You'll basically just start pulling the fur downward, toward the head, as if you were stripping off a jumpsuit. Keep pulling until you get to the shoulders.  If you need to use your knife to help the skinning process, remember to always cut behind the skin and into the membrane, not into the skin itself. Don't get reckless and start scraping away with your knife. Go slowly and use pressure to pull the skin, and let the knife ease any difficult parts, disconnecting any stubborn membrane from the flesh. On male raccoons, you'll have to cut the genitals away from the carcass using your knife. It'll stay attached to the fur, and you can remove it later during the fleshing and stretching process. When you get to the forearms, it's usually recommended that you put the knife away. It's a fatty area, and gets somewhat difficult to distinguish meat from fur, so it's a better idea to use your fingers and go slowly, avoiding the knife and accidental cuts through the pelt. Pull the fur loose around and over the shoulders, down to about the elbow. You can make another cuff cut at that point and separate the fur from the arms. It should now just be attached around the neck. Expose the face of the raccoon and use your knife to cut around the eyes and the ears. Return your attention to the skin side, and keep pulling the pelt down and free of the flesh, working it up the neck and to the jaw. At this point, you'll probably need to use the knife to run along the top jawline on both sides, to separate the pelt from the mouth. Keep pulling until the pelt comes almost entirely free. At this point, there should be a strong point of cartilage that connects the nose to the skin. You're almost done. Just use your knife to cut through it and the pelt should come free in one big piece. Don't pull to hard to try to separate the pelt, because you risk ripping it and damaging the skin. Cut through the cartilage and you'll be done. Raccoons are sometimes eaten, though some sources estimate that as many as 40% of raccoons in North America suffer from intestinal parasites like roundworms, which can make you sick. Raccoons are also scavengers, meaning that they're exposed to a number of diseases and infections. Examine the skin and the flesh of the animal closely for spots, discoloration, or any other signs of infection. If it looks suspect, discard it. If you want to try raccoon and determine that the meat is clean, gut the carcass as you would a rabbit. While less popular than certain other wild game because of the strong and some say unpleasant flavor, brining raccoon for a long period of time and cooking it properly is considered by some to be a delicacy. If you're after more than just the fur, you can learn to prepare the meat in the following section."

      "Coffins come in various sizes and are mostly made from a variety of woods. Besides for appearances, there’s little difference between the options. The funeral director will ask you right away to select the coffin, but you may also order one online.  In many areas, a shroud is the minimum required to cover the body. Be aware of religious customs. In a Muslim funeral, for example, the deceased is often wrapped in a shroud. Visit the probate court clerk's office where the deceased  lived to see if they made a will. They may have left instructions in it that you can use to make arranging the funeral easier. Also consider who the deceased was and use your memories to give them a funeral they’d be proud of.  You aren’t required to follow the wishes written in the will, but honoring those requests can make for a positive memorialization. Think of what the deceased said to you in the past. They might have mentioned what they wanted in a funeral. For example, if you knew they disliked traditional funerals, you might want something outdoors with happy music. Many funerals take place in a funeral home. This is the simplest option, but you may also choose to hold it at the gravesite or in a house of worship. You’ll need to contact the location to set up a day and time, then communicate with the funeral director to transport the deceased’s body there. Research how different faiths handle funeral rites when selecting a religious site. The leaders of the church, synagogue, or mosque can answer any questions you have. Sometimes special events such as wakes, church services, or family dinners are part of the funeral process. Choose events that honor the deceased and also help guests grieve and support one another. Culture and religion play a large part in this. For example, some rites may include prayers or a church service before the funeral and dinner after the funeral. Separate hours may be set aside for friends and loved ones to visit the deceased. Viewings and wakes happen before the funeral service. You’ll need to reserve this time with the funeral home or place of worship where the funeral is meant to be held. Contact local newspapers and websites to announce the plans in the obituary. Also contact the deceased’s place of worship, if they had one, to get the funeral details announced or printed in the bulletin there. The important part is to make sure everyone knows about the passing and funeral. Make sure you spread the word to anyone you want at the funeral. Call, write letters, or send messages on social media as necessary. Funeral homes and mortuary services provide a hearse to carry the body to cemetery or crematorium for a fee. You may also book cars to transport guests in a funeral procession. The costs for this add up, so decide whether or not you’d rather have everyone make their own way to the burial ground. In addition to being costly, sitting in a strange, dark car may be a very strange and upsetting experience for grieving guests.",
      "Select clothing from their personal wardrobe. Think of what makes them look presentable or displays their personality. Many people choose formal wear, although you may opt for favorite clothing like a special t-shirt or uniform. Bring the clothing to the funeral director.  The funeral home will wash the body if you hired a funeral director. They may also be able to provide clothing. Religious customs also dictate what kind of clothing should be worn. Many homes will select flowers or music for you if you don’t do it yourself. Gather any pictures you wish to share, music you’d like to play during the service, and other decorations you’d like to display. You’re under no obligation to do this, but it’s a great way to honor a life.  For example, pick their favorite type of flower or bring in flowers they grew themselves. If they liked classic rock, you can play their favorite songs instead of a church service with organ music. Consult with the other guests to figure out who wants to talk during the service. Since you’re arranging the event, you’ll probably be expected to talk. Rather than dread the occasion, come up with ways to talk about the memories you cherish and the lessons you learned from knowing the deceased.  During a religious service, the spiritual leader covers most of the speaking duties. Nobody should be forced to talk. It’s okay to politely decline a request to speak. Even if you assign speaking duties, it’s good to open up the floor at the end of the service to anyone who wants to share their thoughts. Once the service is over, pallbearers take the coffin to the hearse and then to the burial site. Choose at least 4 people, usually close friends and family, that are willing and have the strength to carry some of the weight.  If there aren't enough pallbearers, the funeral home's staff can help. After a cremation, someone will need to take home the ashes. This is either a close family member or friend who has the option to keep the ashes or scatter them. Food is a comforting distraction, so plan on bringing snacks or having a meal when the service is done. This can be done by calling a catering company, preparing food alone or with other guests, or by reserving a spot at a restaurant after the service.  If you choose to provide food, it doesn’t have to be complicated. Items like small sandwiches, cake, and hot coffee go a long way. Many people won’t feel like cooking, so providing food and company for other guests can be a positive gesture. If you’d like, get a guest book from an office supply store. Set it out at the funeral so everyone signs their name. It’s a great gift to take home or give to someone else to remind them of the support available during this trying time.",
      "After the transportation happens, talk to the director again to plan the funeral. You may do this over the phone, but it helps to visit them in person to go over all your options. There are a lot of choices to make in what may be a difficult time, so you may want a friend or family to come along for support.  Funerals are expensive. Ask the director for a written printout of the costs so you can set up a budget and make changes to the arrangements as necessary. If you don’t feel capable of leaving home, ask the funeral director if they’ll visit you. Some directors  may not be willing to do this, so you’ll need to talk to them over the phone. Discuss the payment options before signing the contract. Most funeral directors and facilities will allow you to pay in installments over time. They may ask for a deposit up front before proceeding to discuss the arrangements.  Most people who pass away don’t have enough money in their bank account to pay for a funeral. Be aware that you’ll get stuck with the charges, so you may need to simplify the funeral or ask for help. If you plan on using the deceased’s bank account to pay, remember that the funds will be frozen once the bank is notified of the death. You’ll need to wait for the probate court to release the assets. Once you’ve agreed to accept the funeral director's help, they will draw up a contract. Read it carefully and ask any questions you have. Signing the contract means you agree and will be liable for any services the director provides. The funeral director will also ask you to choose between a burial or cremation. Have the director explain the benefits in each option. No matter what, you will need to arrange for a burial or cremation spot.  You’ll have an opportunity to consider when the funeral should take place. For an immediate service, a direct burial with a graveside service may be the best option. For religious services, notify the funeral director and the deceased’s place of worship. Both will help make the arrangements according to the tenets of the faith. The deceased may have a burial plot reserved. Check with the probate court or family members to find out. When they don’t have a spot, you’ll need to contact the cemetery or crematorium to purchase their services. The funeral director may include these fees in the bill. If not, you’ll need to pay the fees directly to the cemetery or crematorium owners after contacting them. After the passing has been legally documented by a medical professional, you can retrieve an official death certificate needed for burial or cremation. Normally, the funeral director handles the paperwork. When doing it yourself, contact your the registrar or vital statistic office in the area where the deceased lived.  The certificate should be obtained within 5 to 10 days of the passing, but before the funeral takes place. This certificate is used to report to relevant financial institutions, insurance agencies, and government programs, which you should do as soon as possible.",
      "Alert the deceased’s medical provider or the emergency response service in your area. They’ll legally declare that the deceased has passed, which is needed when obtaining the death certificate. If this happened in a hospital or another facility, the staff will take care of this for you. It’s normal to not feel ready for this step, but it’s recommended that you call right away. The director can take care of a lot of the hassle, including setting up the funeral, transportation, and legal paperwork.  You’ll need to provide basic information, such as the deceased’s name and address, where they’re currently resting, and the contact information of the their doctor. It’s possible in many areas to arrange the funeral without a director. You may need to wash the deceased, transport them, and arrange for their burial or cremation yourself. Check the laws in your area to see if this is possible. Hospitals and other facilities require the remains to be removed within hours. The funeral director will arrange this during your first conversation with them. Pick a funeral home or mortuary in the area where the deceased lived.  The funeral home takes care of washing and dressing the deceased and can help you arrange further transportation in case you need to have the funeral somewhere else. If you need to have the funeral farther away, make use of one of these facilities while you arrange the extra transportation."

      "Before you give any medication to your cat, you should talk to your veterinarian first. Your veterinarian will examine your cat and determine the best course of treatment for his/her condition. If medication is required, your veterinarian will prescribe it and explain how to administer it to your cat. Ask if you are unsure about any of the instructions.  Ask your veterinarian for a demonstration. If you will be giving your cat pills without food, you may benefit from a demonstration by your veterinarian. Before you leave the vet’s office, ask if he or she can demonstrate how to give the medication to your cat. That will allow you to see the process and ask any questions that you have at the time. If your cat is sick, do not attempt to diagnose your cat yourself. Take him to see a veterinarian as soon as possible. Never give medicine to your cat that was prescribed for a human, a different cat, or another pet. Before you administer the medication to your cat, read the instructions carefully and make sure that you understand them. If you have any questions or concerns about the medication, call your cat’s veterinarian. Some questions you may want to ask your veterinarian include:  What time should the medication be given? Should the medication be given with or without food? How should the medication be given? By mouth? By injection? Can I crush the medication? What are the potential side effects of this medication? How do I keep myself safe when administering the medication? Should I wear gloves? Before you give your cat the medicine, make sure that you are clear on the best way to give the medication. If you are able to give your cat his medicine with food, that will be the easiest and most pleasant method for both of you.   With Food  If the medication can be taken by mouth with food, then your best option is to use Pill Pockets or another type of food that your cat likes. You may need to experiment with different types of food before you find something that your cat really likes.  Without Food  If your cat needs to take his medication on an empty stomach, you will need to use a pill syringe or carefully place the pill in your cat’s mouth while you restrain him. If you need to administer a liquid medicine, you will need to use a medicine dropper to put the medicine into your cat’s mouth while you restrain him.",
      "Before you restrain your cat, you will need to get his medicine ready to go. If you have not done so already, read the medicine label carefully before you prepare your cat’s medicine. Call your cat’s veterinarian if you have any questions about how to administer the medicine.  Your vet may give you a pill pusher if you will be administering pills without food. A pill pusher is like a syringe for pills, so that you do not have to stick your fingers into your cat’s mouth. If your cat will be taking liquid medicine, your will need to use a medicine dropper. Double check the dosage for your cat’s medicine and make sure that you have prepared the correct amount. If your cat has to take a pill without food, prepare a medicine dropper with about 5ml of water as well. You can give this water to your cat after administering the pill to ensure that your cat swallows the pill and it doesn’t get stuck in his esophagus.  Place your cat’s medicine someplace close to where you will be holding your cat, so that you can grab it as soon as the cat's mouth is open. For example, you could place the medicine on a paper towel on a nearby surface or ask someone to hold it for you. Wrap your cat up like a burrito by placing him onto the middle of the towel and quickly pulling the sides up around him. If you have to administer a pill to your cat without food, you will have to restrain him and put the pill into his mouth. If your cat is not used to taking pills, then there is a good chance that he will struggle to get free. By wrapping him in a towel with only his head exposed, you can prevent him from finding traction on your body and getting away from you. The towel will also help to prevent him from scratching you.  You can also try holding your cat in your lap while you administer the medicine, if that feels easier for you. You should still wrap your cat in a towel because there is still a good chance that he will try to get away.  You may also want to enlist the help of a friend or family member if this is a new experience for your cat. That way, one of you can hold your cat and the other can administer the medicine with both hands. Any surface that is at least waist high will make it easier for you to administer your cat’s medication. Hold your cat (still wrapped in the towel) while allowing his body to rest on the surface. If you are administering the medicine by yourself, you will want to have one hip against the side of the surface and your arm around your cat. Use your thumb and ring finger to press the corners of your cat’s mouth. Your cat’s mouth should begin to open as you apply pressure. If your cat’s mouth is not opening wide enough to give the medicine, use your other hand to gently push down on your cat’s lower jaw. Do your best to keep your fingers out of your cat’s mouth as you hold it open. Keep them on the edges of his mouth so that they are out of the reach of his teeth. If you are using a pill pusher, put the pill towards the back of your cat’s tongue. If you are using a medicine dropper, insert the dropper between the cat's cheek and teeth. Do not squirt liquid medication into the cat's throat or tongue. Liquids are likely to go down a cat's windpipe, making the cat choke. Follow up with the 5 milliliters (0.17  fl oz) medicine dropper of water if you are give your cat a pill without food. Make sure to administer the water between your cat’s cheek and teeth. After you have administered the medicine, close your cat’s throat and gently stroke his throat under his chin. This will help to encourage him to swallow the pill. Even though you cannot give your cat a treat to reward him for taking his medicine, you should still do something to let him know you are happy with him. Pet him, play with him, and praise him immediately after you finish giving your cat his medicine. Give your cat a drink or syringe a small volume of water into the side of his mouth (remember not to squirt straight into the cat's throat or onto tongue, as the water will likely end up down his windpipe). This washes the pill down so that it doesn't get stuck halfway down the esophagus. Some meds can burn if they get stuck, with potentially serious consequences.",
      "If your cat can take his medication with food, your best bet is to use a commercial product like Pill Pockets to coat your cat’s pills. You can find Pill Pockets in pet stores. If you cannot find pill pockets or if your cat does not like them, try using wet cat food to make tiny meatballs to coat your cat’s pills. You can also look for Flavor Doh, which is another brand of pill concealing treats. It is much easier to mix a powder in with a strong-flavored food (to hide the taste) than administer a pill; however, be aware not all pills are suitable for crushing. If the pill is a slow-release pill, crushing it will destroy this property, making an overdose possible. Or crushing it may simply make it taste unpleasant, and your cat will taste it and reject the food. Put your cat’s pill into a Pill Pocket or Flavor Doh. Make sure that the treat is sticking to the pill so that your cat will not be able to separate the pill from the treat. Have a few other non-medicine treats ready to give your cat after he eats the pill treat. If you are using wet cat food instead, make four tiny meatballs using a cat food that your cat likes and then insert one of the pills into one of the meatballs. Keep track of which meatball you put the pill into! Give your cat the treats you have prepared in a location that he likes, such as where he normally eats or a favorite roosting spot. If you are using the Pill Pockets or Flavor Doh, simply give your cat the treat and make sure he eats it. If he spits it out, you can try again with a new treat or use wet cat food to make tiny meatballs. To give your cat the treat using the wet cat food, give him two of the four meatballs that do not contain the pill. Then, give him the pill meatball and wait for him to swallow it. Follow up with the last non-medicine meatball to help get the medicine taste out of his mouth. The last non-medicine meatball will prevent him from associating the cat food with a bad taste, which will make it easier to keep using this method. After your cat has taken his treat using either method, make sure to follow up by giving him one of his favorite treats. You can also pet him and play with him if he is feeling up to it. Just do whatever you can to make the experience pleasant for him so that he looks forward to taking his medicine in the future. Be aware that some cats develop an aversion to the food containing the pill. Try to avoid \"pilling\" with a food your cat relies on, in case they refuse to eat it in future because they link it to a pill."

      "If you drop or spill an item on your clothes, dab ice water or seltzer immediately so that the stain does not set. Make sure that you dab rather than rub. Before washing spray the area with a stain pre-treatment.   Don't clean stains with hot water, as this will set the stain. Try to get to the stain before it dries, while it is still wet. Don't put stained clothes into the dryer as this will make the stain permanent. Redo the stain treatment, then wash the garment again. Be aware that it may not be possible to remove all stains entirely. In this case, fade the stain as much as possible. Hot sauces, grease, and food can splash and cause damage to clothes.  Don't start making your favorite marinara or standing in front of your deep-fryer without an apron on.   This also goes for arts and crafts. Many paints can stain clothing, so it would be a good idea to wear old jeans and shirts that you no longer care about. If you don't have any aprons or junk clothing to spare while cooking or cleaning, stick with darker clothes. They don't show dirt or stains as easily as light-colored garments. Rather than pulling on them and ruining more stitches, you should snip loose strings and thread as soon as possible. If the seam has already lost too many stitches, consider learning how to stitch or sew, so you can fix the small problem before it becomes a bigger one.   When repairing loose stitching, it is often easier to do it by hand. Always match the thread color to the stitching. While it may be tempting to pull on loose threads, this can actually make the problem worse. Always snip the thread off. Proper washing and drying methods will prevent pills in the first place, but if you already have pilled clothes you can try to fix them yourself, rather than throwing the garment out. You can use a store-bought pilling shaver, but you can also easily remove the bobbles with a pumice stone, a shaving razor, or even a Velcro hair roller.",
      "When the washing machine is done, you'll need to get ready to dry your laundry. If you plan to use an automatic dryer some items may need to be sorted out. Bras, sports jerseys, and athletic wear are among items that often benefit from manual drying. If you live in a temperate climate with low humidity and available outdoor space, you'll need to decide whether you want to hang your clothes outside or use an automatic dryer. If you live in a less ideal climate or don't have space, you'll need to opt for an automatic dryer.   Hanging items to dry prevents them from shrinking.   If you have the time, drying in natural sunlight and air is usually best. Sunlight is a natural disinfectant, and drying outdoors is both eco-friendly and will save you money. If you are naturally drying your laundry outdoors, bravo! Simply check on it every few hours. If you are using an automatic dryer you will need to clean the lint filter, add a dryer sheet or two (if desired) and select your drying cycle. Start up the machine and return when it is done.  Just like you carefully selected a wash cycle, carefully select a dry cycle that is appropriate for your clothes. Higher heat and a rougher tumble get the job done faster, but are harder on clothes.",
      "This seems intuitive, but it's more difficult than most people think. Sort laundry based on cleaning instructions, type of laundry, and color.Make sure that you are only washing dirty clothes, as unnecessary washing of clean clothes can shorter their life.   Set aside any dry-clean only articles of clothing. Group together any delicates or cold-wash only clothing. Group towels and heavy linens. Separate the rest of your clothes into whites and dark or colored groups. Turn T-shirts inside out to prevent the outside from wearing out and fading.  This is especially important with graphic tees. Now that your clothes are sorted you are almost ready to start washing. Review cleaning instructions for whichever group of laundry you want to begin with. Pre-treat any stained items with a stain removing spray or pen. Add detergent and fabric softener (if desired) to the washing machine. Some washing machines have various preset cycles. If yours does, select the cycle that applies to your group of clothes. If yours does not, follow cleaning instructions on the tags of your clothes and follow a few guidelines.  Delicates and cold-wash only clothing need cold water and a gentle spin cycle. Towels and linens can generally tolerate a warmer temperature and heavy spin cycle. Whites will get cleanest using hot water, making it ideal unless any whites are not pre-shrunk.  Hot water can cause some color bleeding for dark or bright colors, so use warm or cold water. This step is simple. Close the lid or door and press start! Be sure to observe the wash time - you'll want to dry your laundry quickly after washing it, lest it start to become stale. Never wash the clothes marked as ‘Dry Clean Only’ at home, as these delicate clothes/ fabrics may lose their color, shine, texture or embellishments on washing. Ones marked ‘Dry Clean First Wash’ should be given to professional cleaners the first time. Subsequently, you can wash them, using detergents meant for delicate clothes and tepid/ cold water. Give them to professional and trusted dry cleaners for ‘petrol wash’. Ethnic clothes like heavily embroidered Lehengas, delicate sarees and silk kimonos must not be washed/ dry cleaned frequently.",
      "If you used an automatic dryer it is important to remove clothes from the dryer immediately. If you dried your clothes naturally there is less of a rush, but you shouldn't leave them out longer than necessary either.  Leaving clothes in the dryer for too long can cause them to wrinkle. Clothes are much easier to hang and fold wrinkle-free when they are freshly dried. You'll want to get nice shirts, dresses, trousers, sweaters, and any other hanging clothes on a hanger and onto the rack. Be sure to use an appropriately sized hanger.  If you spot creases in your garments, try smoothing them out by hand. If the clothes are still warm this will often be successful. If smoothing out by hand does not work, consider using a clothes iron. Neatly fold and store your clothes. When possible, try to fold along the seams of the garment. It is necessary to fold pants by lining up their seams and creases.  If a garment is not amenable to folding, consider gently rolling the garment and storing it to ensure that it does not wrinkle. Don't pack stored clothes too tightly. If you have clothes that you do not use often - particularly if they are in a closet - consider using pest deterrents like mothballs and dryer sheets to dispel moths.  If clothes have been sitting unused for some time air them out rather than washing them again. Washing adds wear and tear to your clothes. While necessary when clothes are dirty, unnecessary washing shortens the life of your garments."

      "If you're simply trying to change the name that displays upon boot-up and on the start screen--not the official registration--then your accuracy doesn't really matter. Be creative! Nicknames, pet names, or other monikers are great ideas if you're looking for a change in scenery, so to speak. Control Panel allows you to make changes to system processes and apps. The easiest way to find Control Panel is by typing its name into the search bar located in the start menu, then clicking the relevant app as soon as it pops up.   On older systems, it is possible to access Control Panel through system settings; on newer systems such as Windows 8 and 10, however, it's easier to simply search \"Control Panel\" and click on the resulting app. You can also open Run and type in \"control panel\" to open this folder. Once Control Panel opens, look for and click on a subcategory labeled \"User Accounts\".  Make sure you don't click on the link entitled \"Type of account\"; this will open a series of settings that can potentially harm your computer or your ownership thereof if handled incorrectly. User Accounts may redirect you to a subfolder with another link entitled \"User Accounts\"--if so, click this link. Once you've accessed the User Accounts folder, find the link entitled \"Change your account name\" and click on it. This will bring up the option to type in a new account name. Type in the name of your choosing and click \"Change Name\" to finalize the process. Note that, while this change does affect the login name above your password entry box, the official registration of your computer and the default username will remain the way it appeared before. When you log back in, your computer should display your newly-entered name above the login information section. This will finalize your process.",
      "Registry editor allows you to make changes to system software and hidden files, which is what you'll need to do to edit the default username. To open the registry editor, go to Run, type in \"regedit\", and click \"OK\". This should bring up the registry editor, in which several folders should be viewable in the left-hand corner of the window.  You may encounter a pop-up window asking you if you're sure you want to open registry editor. Click \"OK\" to continue. If your system sends you an error message that states your ineligibility to access registry editor, you're probably not cleared to make changes to software on that specific machine. Locate the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE file and expand it, then do the same for the ensuing files SOFTWARE, Microsoft, and finally Windows NT. Make sure you're expanding these files, not just clicking on them.  To expand a file, click the chevron-style arrow next to it. This should result in an extensive list of all the sub-folders appearing. Click on--but don't expand--a file labeled \"CurrentVersion\", then scroll down to an item labeled \"RegisteredOwner\" in the right-hand pane and double click it to bring up the value editor. You can change this value from the current name to whatever you see fit.  You can also change the registered organization in the same location by double-clicking the item labeled \"Registered Organization\". Again, make sure you have explicit permission to make this change before doing so if you're on a shared computer. Though you've changed the registered user at this point, the default name that will show on the login screen isn't bound to this registry item. To finalize your changes, scroll through the contents of \"CurrentVersion\" until you find a folder entitled \"Winlogon\"; click on this file, find the registry item labeled \"DefaultUser\" (or \"DefaultUsername\") and double-click it to change its value. Make sure this value perfectly matches the change you made to the registered owner above. To ensure your changes carried over, open the file explorer by accessing the Start menu and clicking on \"File Explorer\" (Windows 8 and 10). Find the \"File\" tab in the upper left-hand corner, click it, and then click on \"Help\"; click \"About Windows\" in the resulting menu. A window should pop up with your PC's details, including its registered name. If the name on the window matches the name you entered, you're good to go!  A much easier and more consistent way of verifying your name is by opening System Information and scrolling through your system's details until you come to your registered name. To access System Information in any operating system, open Run, type in \"msinfo32.exe\" without the quotation marks, and click \"OK\". On Windows XP, you'll open \"Explore\" from Start, then go to \"Help\" in the upper left-hand corner and click on \"About Windows\" in the menu. On Windows Vista and Windows 7, you'll click \"Open Windows Explorer\" from Start, then click the \"Help\" tab in the upper left-hand corner and click on \"About Windows\" in the menu."

      "Killing Stinkhorn Fungus with Bleach or Lime"
    ],
    "document": [
      "If you’re dealing with a stinkhorn, this probably won’t take a lot of effort. stinkhorns are known to be a noxious fungus, and their smell can be likened to that of feces or a dead and decaying animal.  Although the stinkhorns may smell offensive, they are not poisonous to humans or pets. Stinkhorn fungi will not harm your pets or any other plants in their vicinity. Stinkhorns use their unpleasant smell to attract flies. Flies land on the mushroom, pick up spores on their legs and bodies, and distribute these sports wherever they fly. So, if you notice a large number of flies around a specific mushroom, you may be dealing with a stinkhorn. If you suspect you’re dealing with a stinkhorn, confirm that the environment it’s growing in correlates with a type stinkhorns prefer. Although stinkhorn mushrooms prefer moist areas and patches of ground covered in mulch, they can pop up in many types of terrains. Like all fungus, stinkhorns can also sprout out of the wood of dead and decaying trees. Varieties of stinkhorn fungus grow naturally throughout nearly all of North America and into Central America. Some varieties prefer subtropical and tropical regions, including parts of Mexico. The most common type of stinkhorn fungus (‘’Phallus ravenelii’’) has a pale white stalk and a phallic shape. The mushroom typically stands between 10–15 cm (4–6 inches) high, and the cap at its tip ranges in diameter from 1–4 cm (0.4–1.6 inches). The cap itself is slimy and dark brown, with a coarse texture. The mushroom’s long, cream-colored stem has a spongy texture. At the very tip of a stinkhorn mushroom’s brown cap, there is a white ring-like circle with an opening at the tip. There are over 25 types of stinkhorn fungi that live in North America. Most, like ‘’Phallus ravenelii’’, have a thin stalk with a bulbous, slimy head which bears the spores. Colors can vary, and many stinkhorns are pink or reddish in color. Shape and size of the mushrooms can also vary. Most mushrooms range from 2–6 cm (0.8–2.4 inches), although some species grow as tall as 15 cm (6 inches).",
      "Don’t simply clip off the above-ground portion of the mushroom; you’ll need to dig beneath it until you’ve scooped out the mushroom’s egg-shaped base. Also dig under any nearby round white egg-shaped growths, as these are going to be new stinkhorns soon. Secure the foul smelling removed material in a plastic bag. If you don’t want to get your hands dirty (and smelly) from the stinkhorn, put on a pair of cheap latex disposable gloves. Put these in an airtight plastic bag and throw them away immediately after you finish killing the mushrooms. There may be spores or other undeveloped mushrooms in the soil immediately surrounding the mushroom you’ve removed, so dig up the top layer of soil in about a 6-inch radius around the mushroom you’ve removed. If the fungus grew in a medium other than soil—such as tree bark, mulch, or other loose decaying plant material—remove this using the shovel as well. Place the excavated soil (or other material) in the plastic bag along with the stinkhorn fungus. Then, seal the bag firmly shut. Do not place the discarded fungal matter with yard waste, since, if the bag were to rupture or open, spores could escape and create new mushrooms. After these steps, if mushrooms begin to reoccur, you may need to apply a chemical agent. This will make sure that the mushroom and surrounding spores are truly dead. After applying the fungal killer spray as directed on the packaging, allow the affected area to receive sunlight and dry out. The spray should also keep recurrence to a minimum. You should be able to find a safe, nontoxic fungal killer spray at your local plant nursery or gardening center.",
      "Begin this process in your kitchen by boiling the water in a large saucepan on your stovetop. Then, in your yard or garage, pour in bleach. Add roughly the same amount of bleach as you did of water (e.g. 4 cups of each) so that they’re mixed at a 1:1 ratio.  When working with bleach, make sure to wear clothes that you don’t mind ruining, since the bleach will remove color from any fabric it splashes onto. Also consider wearing eye protection (such as safety goggles) to avoid the risk of splashing bleach into your eyes. Be aware that removing mushrooms using bleach or lime will likely harm—and possibly kill—other plants in the area. The chemicals will also damage your soil. Do this while the water is still hot; do not wait for the solution to cool down. The combination of boiling hot water and potent bleach should be enough to kill any lingering stinkhorns, and prevent new mushrooms from growing in the soil. If you choose to first dig up the mushrooms before you apply bleach, simply pour the hot bleach solution over the entire area from which you dug up the stinkhorns. If you haven’t had success removing stinkhorn mushrooms, lime will help by making the soil uninhabitable for the fungus. Using a shovel or trowel, spread the lime over the patch of soil that has been producing stinkhorn fungi. Lime is a caustic substance, so be careful when handling it.  You should be able to purchase lime at a local hardware store, plant nursery, or gardening center. Before applying the lime to the soil, read the instructions printed on the package. You may need to first dampen the soil before laying down lime."

      "Dissolving Vitamins in Water",
      "Adding Fruits and Vegetables to Water"
    ],
    "document": [
      "There are two types of vitamins: water and fat soluble. Water soluble vitamins enter the bloodstream through water while fat soluble vitamins need dietary fat to dissolve. Learning which vitamins are water soluble can help you mix the right vitamins into your water and get optimal nutritional benefits from them.  Be aware that foods such as fruit, vegetables, potatoes, grains, and dairy foods are high in water-soluble vitamins.  Exposing water-soluble vitamins to heat can cause them to lose their potency or destroy them altogether.  Getting water-soluble vitamins is often easiest by steaming or grilling foods and pouring cooking water into soups or stews. A wide range of vitamins are water-soluble. Informing yourself which vitamins are water soluble can help figure out what supplements or foods to add to your water. The two most prominent water soluble vitamins are:  Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes tissue health and helps your body absorb iron. It may also help heal wounds.  B vitamins, including niacin and B-12, help maintain the health of your circulatory system, brain health, cell metabolism and nerve function. You need Vitamin C and the B vitamins to maintain your overall health, and it most cases you’ll get through by eating nutritious whole foods. However, being aware of how much you need daily can help you figure out what supplements you need to add to your water.  Women should get 75 mg vitamin C while men should aim for 90 mg.  Eating citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, broccoli, spinach and drinking 100% fruit juices can help you reach your vitamin C goal every day.  Get the recommended daily dose of the B-vitamins according to the specific vitamin. For example, adults need 2.4 mg of B-12 per day; 400 micrograms of B-9, which is also called folic acid; and 14 – 16 milligrams of B-3, or niacin, every day.  Eating a range of foods such as whole and fortified or enriched grains, nuts, peas, meat, shellfish, poultry, eggs, dairy, peanut butter, and bananas can help you get all of the B vitamins you need.",
      "You might find it hard to get enough vitamins and nutrients through your diet. While it’s ok to add a multi-vitamin or supplements to your water, try and get as many of these as possible from foods.  Consult with your doctor before taking vitamins and supplements to ensure they are safe for you. Be aware of vitamin “megadoses,” which may be detrimental to your health.  Taking too many of them for a long time can have harmful effects. Effervescent Vitamin and mineral supplements have up to 1g of salt per tablet. You can buy tablets to crush, a prepared powder, or liquid vitamin supplements, which will dissolve better than tablets. Deciding on the type of vitamin to take is an important step in knowing how to add vitamins to water.  Remember that Vitamins C and the B Complex are the only supplements you can mix with water to get their nutritional value. Other vitamins need fat to circulate through your system.  Buy single pills of vitamin C or B complex at your local pharmacy and crush them. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or health store specialist if there are powdered or liquid versions of the vitamins you can mix with water. If you decide to use vitamin pills in your water, you’ll need to pulverize them before you mix them into the water. Use a mortar and pestle or a pill crusher.  Make sure the vitamins are ground into a fine powder so that they mix easily into the water.  Be aware that not fully pulverizing the pills could make it difficult for your body to absorb them.  Crush only the recommended daily dose of your vitamin. If you chose to use a powdered vitamin or liquid form, read the packaging label. This can help you know the amount to mix with water for optimal absorption. Avoid taking more than the recommended value per day. This can help prevent serious health conditions from consuming too many vitamins. Once your supplement powder or liquid are ready, you’re ready to mix them with your water. Make sure to shake the mixture well in a clean bottle so that the vitamins are able to be easily absorbed in your system.  Use boiled or distilled water, not plain tap water. Fill the water bottle ¾ full and then add the vitamins. Consider adding them to warm water for better dissolving and absorption by your body.",
      "If you prefer to avoid supplements, you can also add whole fruits or vegetables with Vitamins C and B Complex to your water. This may add vitamins to water without chemicals and may add a pleasant flavor as well.  Add slices of lemon or orange or your water for a boost of vitamin C.  Add raspberries to your water for a boost of B vitamins. You can also get B vitamins from papayas, cantaloupe, and oranges. These can help flavor your water.  Try adding a little grapefruit juice. It is low in calories, rich in phytonutrients and anti-oxidants, as well as vitamin A and C. Although smoothies are often made with milk, you can add fruits and vegetables to water and blend them into a smoothie. This can help you can vitamins in your water.  Mix vegetables and fruits high in Vitamins C and B Complex to the water and some ice cubes. Consider choices like spinach, kale, strawberries, and blueberries. Remember that getting vitamins through food is the best way to get them. Adding fruits and veggies high in water-soluble vitamins may be the optimal way to do this. There are many waters or beverages on the market that claim to be vitamin-enhanced. But many don’t contain that many vitamins and also have a considerable amount of sugar. In fact, one expert said that vitamin waters are essentially just soft drinks. Drink these beverages if you are in a pinch or want the flavor."

      "After you’ve removed excess dirt and grass, you should pre-treat your grass stain for the best removal. Pretreat by dabbing a 50/50 mixture of warm water and white vinegar. Saturate the stain well to ensure deep penetration by the vinegar. Allow the watered down vinegar to sit for five minutes. Never use fruit vinegar for stain treatment. Only use plain white vinegar. After your vinegar solution has sat on the clothing item for five minutes, apply laundry detergent directly to the stain. If available, use a detergent that has bleach. Bleach contains enzymes which help break down grain stains. Using powder detergent? Try mixing a dash of water into the powder to make it paste-like, then spread over the stain. Once you’ve applied the detergent, massage the stain. You want to massage gently, as to not ruin the clothing, but firmly, to ensure you get deep into the stain. The longer you massage the more effective the treatment is likely to be. After massaging for several minutes, allow the detergent to sit. Once the stain has sat for 10-15 minutes, give it a rinse with cold water. Check to see if the stain has been removed. It should be significantly fainter, if not completely removed. If the stain isn’t banished, you can safely repeat the process with water, vinegar, and detergent until the garment is stain-free.",
      "If you’ve got a particularly stubborn grass stain, try using a homemade stain remover. Mix ¼ cup bleach, ¼ cup peroxide and ¾ cups cold water into a container. The combination of hydrogen peroxide with bleach will work as an incredible stain remover.  When working with bleach and peroxide, mix in a well-ventilated area to prevent inhalation of fumes. Never substitute bleach with ammonia. Ammonia is known to immediately set a stain.  Bleach is known to change the color of a garment. Always spot test on an inconspicuous location before applying the mixture to the stain. Place your homemade solution onto the stained area. Allow it to saturate the stain. Next, massage it in gently. Once you’ve massaged for several minutes, put the garment somewhere safe and allow it to sit. Ideally your solution can sit on your clothing for 30-60 minutes, but longer is better. Once your item has finished sitting, give it a thorough rinse. Check to see if the stain has disappeared. If there is still traces, feel free to apply your DIY-remover again. If it is gone, you can launder the clothing as normal.",
      "On the inside of your garment, there is a care label. Reading this label will give you an idea of what you can use on your garment safely. For example, an empty triangle is the symbol for bleach. If the triangle is black with a large “X” through it, you cannot use bleach of any sort. If the triangle is striped black and white, you can use non-chlorine bleach only. Before using any cleaning product or detergent, read the label. The label can help identify which products are best for which garment. It can also tell you if it is safe on the type of garment you are using. For example, a detergent with bleach will be best for a white garment, but may not be the best choice for a dark colored garment. Before putting anything on a stained item of clothing, do a test spot first. A test spot will allow you to check that you can use your stain removal solution on the clothing without causing permanent damage like changing the colour. The inside hem is a great location to test a solution because it is very inconspicuous. Before doing anything with your item, you should remove excess dirt or grass from the stained location. Blot, rather than rub, to try get the excess out. Rubbing will only cause the stain to move further into your clothing. Struggling to get some dirt off? Try holding the clothing taut between your fingers, and flicking from the inside of the garment. This should forcefully fling off any excess mud.",
      "Isopropyl alcohol is a solvent that will dislodge any color from stains. This includes the green pigment left behind by grass. To wet the stain, take a sponge or cotton swab and generously dab with alcohol.  Rubbing alcohol, also known as isopropyl alcohol, works on removing grass stains because it dissolves the green pigment left behind in a grass stain. If you’re working on a delicate fabric, try a 50:50 solution of water and alcohol. Note that adding water means it may take longer to dry. Allow the stain to complete air dry before moving forward. The alcohol will evaporate out of the stain and most of the pigment should be dislodged. After the stain is dry, rinse it with cool water. Using cool water prevents the stain from setting. Use of hot water, or heat at all, will set the stain and make it more difficult to remove. Apply a small amount of detergent to the stain. Massage for at least five minutes, but the longer the better. Once you’re satisfied with your massaging, rinse the stain with cold water until the water runs clear. Allow the garment to air dry. Once it is dry, check to see if the stain is gone. If not, repeat the process. If the stain has been removed, you can launder the item as normal."

      "Before attempting to bend the steel bar, you need to wrap it in material to make it easier to grip and bend, as well as to protect your hands as you bend it. Suitable wrapping materials include the following: Leather. Leather is the toughest material you can use to wrap the steel with and is the best material for adding leverage to your grip.    {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\/aid1771335-v4-728px-Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":322,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"510\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  Cordura. Cordura, a synthetic canvas-like fabric, is used in professionally created bending wraps. It's as puncture resistant and durable as leather, but not as good in adding leverage to your grip. Cordura is initially stiff, but becomes more supple over time as it absorbs the oils from your skin.    {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b1\\/Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b1\\/Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\\/aid1771335-v4-728px-Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":322,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"510\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  Heavy cloth. A heavy cloth, such as a shop cloth or rag, is the cheapest suitable wrapping material, and has been traditionally used for nail bending feats. However, it is nowhere near as durable or puncture-proof as either leather or Cordura.    {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/96\\/Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/9\\/96\\/Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet3.jpg\\/aid1771335-v4-728px-Bend-Steel-Step-5Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":322,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"510\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} If you're using leather, cut strips twelve inches (30 cm) long by four inches (10 cm) wide. If you're using either Cordura or heavy cloth, fold the material into strips of these dimensions. The chalk will keep the wrap from slipping once it's wrapped around the steel.",
      "If you're using either the double overhand or palms down grip, your thumbs should be pushing into the nail or bar through the wrapping, while your index, middle, and ring fingers are wrapped tightly around the bar. If you're using the double underhand grip, your pinkies should grip the bar the tightest, while your index, middle, and ring fingers grip the bar slightly less tightly. Push your fulcrum fingers into the steel as you start bending the ends of the bar toward each other. Your wrists will channel the driving force from your arm muscles, concentrated in your index fingers with the double overhand or palms down grip, the index finger of your far hand with the reverse grip, or your upper palms with the double underhand grip. Your goal is to bend the bar to at least a 45-degree angle. Keep up the bending pressure from your fulcrum fingers and your driving muscles as you bend the steel further, until your fulcrum fingers start to touch.  If you're bending from the double overhand position, you can go from making the initial bend to continuing the bend in a single motion without changing your hand grip. If you're bending from the palms down or reverse position, you may have to change to the double overhand position to continue bending the steel. Ideally, you want to make this part of the bend in a single, smooth motion. If you're not strong enough to do that, you can make multiple attempts in rapid succession, using as much force as you can muster. Don't rest too long between attempts, or the steel will cool, making it harder to bend. Press the ends of the bar together until you can lace your fingers together; the ends should be about 2 inches (5 cm) apart. Then, use your clasped hands and upper arms like a nutcracker to finish bending the steel.  You may have to remove some of the wrapping around the steel if it gets in the way. You may also have to grasp the bent steel in one hand and clasp that hand with your other hand, squeezing both the steel and your hand. As with the sweep, crush the bar's ends together should follow quickly after making the 90-degree bend so that the steel doesn't have time to cool.",
      "You can grip the steel bar in one of four ways: double overhand, double underhand, palms down, and reverse. Each method has its own individual techniques.  In the double overhand grip, you hold the bar close to your body, preferably just under the chin, with your hands gripping the steel from above. This method transfers the greatest force from your arm muscles into the bend and is the best grip to use on thicker bars.    {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/ca\\/Bend-Steel-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Bend-Steel-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/ca\\/Bend-Steel-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/aid1771335-v4-728px-Bend-Steel-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":322,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"510\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}  In the double underhand grip, you also hold the bar close to your body, although at about the center of the breastbone.

      "Most steel bars are either hot-rolled or cold-rolled; a cold rolled bar is shinier than a hot rolled bar, but is also harder to bend. Stainless steel is even harder to bend. The stronger the steel, the more the bend will approximate a \"V\", while the weaker the steel, the more the bend will look like a \"U.\" Most strongmen who bend steel bars prefer to work with lengths of five to seven inches (12.5 to 17.5 cm). (A common strongman feat was bending a 60-penny nail, which is 6 inches [15 cm] long.) The shorter the bar, the harder it is to bend, as shorter lengths give less bending leverage than longer lengths; however, some prefer a six inch (15 cm) bar to a seven inch (17.5 cm) bar because of the way the stock was formed. You can buy steel bars in the optimal length for hand-bending from some online retailers or buy longer bars either online or from your local hardware store and cut off a piece of the desired length. To cut the steel bar, use a pair of bolt cutters, preferably about 24 inches (60 cm) long. Wear safety goggles when cutting, as short pieces can travel at high speed when cut from the larger bar stock. Grind or file off the cut end to smooth it. Thicker bars are harder to bend than thinner bars. Doubling the diameter quadruples the amount of force required to bend the bar; it takes four times the torque to bend a 3/8-inch (9.6 mm) bar as it does a 3/16-inch (4.8 mm) bar."

      "You'll need a power drill, a dozen craft sticks, paint and brush (optional), a photograph (optional), a craft knife, glue, water, and embroidery floss. Do this for the rest of your craft sticks. Make sure all the holes are drilled at the same spot on all the sticks. Use caution when cutting with a power drill. Wear eye protection and do the cutting on a flat surface. This will be the top of your fan and will spread out more than the base. Allow them to dry thoroughly. You may find that some colors, particularly reds, will need 2 or even 3 coats. Make sure the sticks are touching, without any gaps in between them. Enlarge a photograph or cut a magazine photo to the size of the sticks you measured. Make sure your image is the exact same size of the sticks when touching. The image should completely fit over the sticks. If sticks are still visible at the sides, you should enlarge or cut a bigger image. If your photo hangs over the side of the sticks, you need to trim the image down. Use a craft knife to score the picture lightly along the sides of each stick. This will help keep them in order after cutting. Make sure you're numbering the back of the photo and not the picture itself. Use a craft knife to ensure a neat, straight cut. Hold a ruler tightly against the cutting line and slide the knife along the edge of the ruler, pressing hard enough to cut through the picture. Be extremely careful when using the craft knife. In a small container, mix equal parts of craft glue and water. You'll need to brush the glue mix on the back of one picture strip. Center the strip on a stick, and brush a thin coat of the mixture on all sides of the stick and picture. Repeat this for the remaining strips and sticks. Let them dry completely. You can check to make sure your image is correct, by spreading the sticks back out to see if they're in order. Tie a knot in embroidery floss or 1/8-inch (.32 cm) ribbon. Thread the other end through the holes that are 1/4 inch (.64 cm) from the bottom of the sticks. Tie a knot to secure the bottom of the fan. Spread the tops of the sticks so they lie next to one another and tie a knot in the floss while the fan is open. Add a dot of glue to the knots and let them dry completely before opening and closing your fan.",
      "You can leave it square, cut it into a circle, round the bottom and make the top taper for a spade shape, or cut it into a heart. The side of the fan that will be hidden should be facing up at you. Make sure to keep glue off the part of the stick that will extend out from the piece of cardstock. Ensure that a good portion of the stick is extended out from the paper, so you will have a handle to hold. This will hide the stick and create a sturdy double-sided fan. Be sure to spread glue onto the back of the handle, as well as around all edges of the fan. Once it's dry, you can use your fan or embellish it.",
      "You can use a tempera or acrylic paint to decorate your craft sticks or paper. Note that if painting the paper, it's easier to paint before folding your fan. Let your paper or sticks dry completely before using. Using glue or double-sided tape, attach bits of ribbon, lace, buttons, feathers, stickers or beads. Make sure not to add items that are heavy, since they could tear your fan. You can easily make your fan take on a whole new shape by making a few simple cuts. While your paper is folded like an accordion, cut into the top or sides of the folds. Keep your cuts small. When you open your fan, you'll see the small cuts across all the folds.",
      "You can use larger paper, but this size is easy to find and work with. Set the paper in portrait orientation, meaning it's taller than it is wider. Practice with plain or scrap paper when you start learning. You can then switch to more decorative papers once you're comfortable with the technique. Using a pencil and ruler, draw vertical lines 3/4 inch to 1 inch (1.9 cm to 2.54 cm) apart. These should go straight from the bottom to top of the paper. For larger wall fans, move the lines apart in proportion to the paper size. Smaller fans could have smaller folds, which will make the fan seem more detailed. Fold on the first line, bringing the right side of the paper toward you. Use a bone folder to press the crease firmly. You should now see a peak. You should it in the opposite direction of the first fold, creasing the fold with the bone folder. You should now see a dip in the paper, or a valley. You'll start seeing these dips and peaks. They should alternate between these mountains and valleys. You should be grasping the gathered portion between your fingers, while the vertical pleats of the paper extend up and out. The paper fans out. Alternately, you could glue each fold to the next. Place the glue along the bottom of the fan where you've gathered it. If you are using glue, let it dry completely before opening the fan. You can now use the fan or embellish it."

      "Normally, your child won’t experience pain from a loose tooth. If their tooth is painful, it’s possible that they have tooth decay or an injury. Just to be safe, take your child to the dentist to make sure they’re okay. The dentist may decide to pull or treat the tooth themselves. Try not to worry because it’s likely that everything is just fine. If you know your child has experienced a mouth injury, they may need dental care. Your dentist will examine your child’s mouth to figure out if the tooth is loose because of the injury or because it’s time for the tooth to fall out. Then, they’ll help you decide how to treat the loose tooth. They may recommend you go ahead and pull the tooth, but they might also recommend alternative treatments. You likely won’t need to worry about this, but it’s possible for the tooth to break off as you remove it. If this happens, your child needs immediate care because the fragments could cause pain or lead to an infection. Take your child to the dentist to get the fragments removed. Fragments occur more often after a tooth is injured. It’s totally normal for the socket to bleed after you pull the tooth, so try not to worry. However, the bleeding should stop after about 15 minutes of pressing gauze into the socket. Check the bleeding after 15 minutes. If the socket is still bleeding, go to the doctor, an urgent care center, or the emergency room so a doctor can help. A dentist or doctor can help stop the bleeding, so don’t worry. Your child likely won’t develop an infection, so try not to worry about it. However, you need to take them to the dentist immediately if you notice signs of a possible infection. The dentist will help them get the treatment they need to feel better. Go to the dentist immediately if you have the following symptoms:  Fever Pain Bad breath Unpleasant taste in your mouth",
      "Have your child use their tongue or their hands to gently grip the loose tooth and try to wiggle it back and forth. If they’re able to move the tooth easily, then it may be ready to be pulled. If the tooth doesn’t move easily, trying to pull it before it’s ready can cause unnecessary pain, bleeding, and infections. If the tooth does not easily move around easily, wait a few days and then try testing it again. When a tooth is ready to be pulled, the nerve will dissolve and only a small thread of gum tissue will hold the tooth in place. As your child wiggles their loose tooth, ask them if it hurts at all. If it does, then the nerve may still be attached and the tooth isn’t ready to be pulled yet.  Your child may feel some slight discomfort in their gums when they wiggle their tooth, but it shouldn’t cause them any pain if it’s ready to be pulled. You may also see a permanent tooth appearing near the loose tooth, which is totally normal. In addition to the nerve dying away, blood vessels that were attached to the tooth will dissolve as well when the tooth is ready to be removed. While your child wiggles their tooth, check their gums to see if there’s any blood. If there is, then it’s too early to try to pull the tooth.",
      "Talk to your child about pulling their tooth to settle any fears or anxieties that they may have about it. Explain to them that their tooth is loose and will fall out soon, and ask if it’s alright for you to gently pull it out. If your child wants the tooth to fall out on its own, then let them wait. If they’re ready for you to pull it out, you can do it without them being afraid.  Abruptly pulling out a tooth can scare your child and cause unnecessary pain if they struggle. Some children are excited about their teeth coming out, but many have anxieties about potential pain or bleeding. It’s important that you wash your hands thoroughly to prevent infections. Turn on your faucet, let the water warm up, and hold your hands underneath the stream to get them wet. Add a few drops of hand soap or rub a soap bar between your palms and work the soap into a lather by rubbing your hands together. Then, rinse off the soap and dry your hands to remove dirt and germs from the surface of your skin so you don’t introduce them into your child’s mouth.  Dirty hands can cause an infection or illness and should never enter your or your child's mouth. If you have a pair of sterile rubber gloves, it might be good to wear these as well to further reduce the risk of infection. You need your child to hold still for you to take out their tooth, so before you begin, tell them that everything will be okay and that it will be over before they know it. If it helps, you can promise them a reward or a treat if they’re able to stay calm while you pull out their tooth.  For example, you could tell your child that the tooth fairy will come to take their tooth and leave them a present, or you could promise them some ice cream after you pull out their tooth. This is a very formative time for your child, and you don't want to do something that will cause your child to associate the experience with fear, pain, or panic. Take a cotton ball or a piece of gauze and rub the front and back of the tooth you plan to pull to dry it off and make it easier to grip. Wipe the tooth gently and calmly explain to your child that you’re about to pull their tooth and will be over quickly to settle any anxieties that they may have.  If your child sees that you’re calm, then they’re more likely to relax. If you don't have a cotton ball or gauze available, a tissue will work, too. Just make sure it’s clean! Use sterile gauze to add an extra barrier between your hands and your child’s mouth and to provide you with extra grip to hold the tooth. Take about a 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) long strip of gauze and place it between your thumb and index finger so both of your fingertips are covered by it. If you don’t have any sterile gauze, you can use a strip of clean paper towel to help you grip the tooth. Using the gauze pad, grasp the tooth at its base, where it meets the gum. Gently pull the tooth and slightly wiggle it to help work it free. Continue pulling and wiggling until it pops out. Try to pull it out as quickly as you can to keep your child from getting anxious and moving around.  If the tooth is loose enough, it should pop right out with little trouble. If it doesn't come out after a firm pull, it isn't ready yet. Don't continue to pull on a tooth that isn’t ready to come out or you could hurt your child. Wait a few days and then try again. Even if the tooth was very loose, there will still be some bleeding. Take a fresh, sterile piece of gauze and compress the tooth socket with your forefinger and thumb. Have the child bite on the gauze piece for 10 minutes or so. This will help to control the bleeding and promote quicker wound healing. Take 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water and dissolve 1 teaspoon (5.69 g) of table salt into it. Have your child swish the solution around in their mouth for about 30 seconds and then spit it out in the sink to wash the open wound left after pulling the tooth to help prevent infection.  Have your child swish saltwater in their mouth once a day for the next 3-4 days to keep the wound clean. Make sure your child doesn’t swallow the saltwater or it could make them ill."

      "Whether you’re planning an outing, a group trip or going in on a gift for someone, make sure to include this person from the beginning. If they are a part of the planning, they’ll be able to tell you what their budget is and what they are able to contribute.  For example, let your cheap sibling be the first to know if you’re thinking of doing a group gift for your parents. If they want a less expensive option, they are able to suggest ideas themselves. If you had an expensive gift in mind that you’re set on, realize it may be a priority to you, but not to the other people involved.  Understand that they may not be willing to contribute as much financially to the gift, but allow them to put in what they can and help in other ways (like organization and communication). Understanding lessens feelings of resentment for everyone involved. Sometimes, people are unaware that they are doing something wrong. Maybe they assumed an invitation out meant an offer to pay as well. Make sure when you plan to hang out with this person that you set clear expectations from the beginning.  If you're eating out together, ask your server for separate checks at the beginning of the meal. If you're going out as a group, let everyone know in advance that the bill will be split equally per person. If you're hosting a \"bring your own [fill in the blank]\" party, let the person know everyone is expected to bring something. If they’re prepared upfront, they don’t have an excuse for cheap behavior. If expectations have been set, and the behavior continues, you may have to confront the problem directly. If the cheap person you’re dealing with is a good friend or family member, avoiding them isn't an option. It’s not about what you’re doing, but who you’re doing it with. Plan low or no-cost activities with your cheap friend.  Take a hike or some other physical activity. Watch a movie at home. Go to a park. Cook together. Look up free things to do near your city. If you want to do something with this person that you don’t think they'll be willing to pay for, consider giving it to them as a gift. This gives you the opportunity to enjoy time with your loved one without money becoming an issue.  Let’s say you’ve always wanted to take a trip with this person, but you know they won’t include it in their budget. Treat them to a short getaway for their birthday. This takes the pressure of money off of both of you. It is important that you don’t expect an equivalent gift in return. Your friend can give you a thoughtful gift without spending the same amount of money. Don’t let yourself get too hung up on price tags. If the cheap person is a colleague or an acquaintance, your best option may be to avoid going out with them altogether. You’ll be a more pleasant co-worker if you’re not carrying resentment.  Suggest bringing your lunches from home and eat together in the breakroom. Tell them you need to save money, and aren't able to go out.",
      "Confronting people about money related issues can be difficult. Preparing yourself in advance will result in the best outcome. Know what you’ll say in advance. This prevents you from going on and on, straying off topic or saying things you don’t mean. You're not calling out your friend just to make them feel bad. The best way to get a solution, is to suggest one yourself.  You can try, “We’ll take turns choosing where we go. You can choose the next outing.” Reassure them that you don’t have to spend money to have fun together. Go through the conversation in your head. Include how you think they’ll respond. Picture the positive outcome that you hope to get from the confrontation. If thinking about confronting this person brings up negative emotions, you may not be ready to confront them yet. Confrontations, no matter how tactful, don’t always end well. Prepare for a stubborn friend to get angry or remain in denial. Know how you’ll respond if the confrontation takes a bad turn. Emotional confrontations rarely go well. If you allow yourself to get upset and start lecturing the person, they are likely to respond emotionally simply because of your approach. When stating your complaint, don’t include your opinions or judgements. It comes off as condescending. You don’t want this person to feel like you are insulting their character. Stay focused on the unwanted behavior, not the person. A helpful technique often used in therapy is “When you [unwanted action], I feel [emotional response]” statements. This approach allows the person to see the direct effects of their behavior. It also shows that you are coming from a genuine place of hurt, not simply complaining about them.   For example, “When you never offer to pay for the check, I feel like you don’t value our friendship.” Or, “When you ‘forget your wallet’ every time we hang out, I feel like I’m being taken advantage of.” If you’ve approached the problem with maturity and tact and still get bad results, then consider whether this person is a positive addition to your life.  If you still consider this person a valuable part of your life, then you must learn how to cope with this problem in your life long term. If this person brings nothing but negativity and hardship to your life, then end communication with them. You can rest assured that you did your part in trying to resolve the problem."

    ],
    "document": [
      "Hamsters tend to sleep very deeply. In the wild, they will burrow deep into the ground where they can sleep relatively undisturbed. If you wake him up suddenly to hold him, he will likely interpret this as trouble (e.g., a predator) being nearby. If you would like to wake him up, do so gently. For example, you can speak softly to him. You can also gently ruffle your hand in his bedding. Hamsters are very prone to injuries from falling, so you should keep your hamster fairly close to the ground when you are holding him. Do not lift him more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) off the floor.  If he tries to make a run for it, keeping him close to the floor lessens the likelihood of injuring himself if he jumps. Consider holding him when you are lying back on the floor, which would keep him even closer to the ground. Talking to your hamster in a calm and soothing voice will help him feel more comfortable with being held. However, kissing noises can actually be frightening to him. Scruffing your hamster to pick him up can put immense pressure on his head. This pressure may be enough to cause his eyes to prolapse. You should also never pick up your hamster by one of his appendages. Not only would this likely injure your hamster, but he would also be even more disoriented by being lifted in the air by his legs. Hamsters do not know how to make an association between actions and consequences. Therefore, punishing him by yelling at him or physically punishing him will only lead to your hamster seeing you as the enemy.  A firm 'no' should be the strongest punishment you use. Blowing in his face, particularly when he bites you, should be enough to deter him from doing the action again.",
      "If you just brought your hamster home, chances are he will need a little time to get used to you before he will enjoy being handled and held. Wait at least 12 to 24 hours before trying to hold him.  Crouch near your hamster's cage and speak to him in a soft, friendly voice. You can also get him comfortable with your presence by simply reading a book or watching TV in the same room as him. Make sure your hamster can see you and knows you are a friend, not a predator. In the wild, hamsters are grabbed only by a predator, so your hamster will need to learn that you are not acting as a predator when you hold him. Start by placing your hand in his cage and leaving it there for him to investigate.  So as not to startle your hamster, hold your hand limply in his cage. It would also be helpful to hold your hand as a clenched fist initially. You can unclench your fist, with your palm facing upward, as he becomes more comfortable with your hand. Hamsters have a tendency to nibble as a way to test their environment. If your hamster starts to nibble at your hand,  gently  pull your hand away. Jerking your hand away will startle him and may make him more reluctant to approach your hand. Your hamster may be very wary of your hand. If this is the case, try placing treats in your hand to encourage him to approach you. When he is comfortable accepting treats from your hand, he will be more amenable to you picking him up.  Ideal treats are those that your hamster would normally eat in the wild. For example, you can treat him with fresh, rinsed vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) and fruits (e.g., bananas, berries).  Make sure to chop the treats in small pieces before feeding them to your hamster.",
      "Hamsters rely on their noses to navigate their environment, and strong smells can cause them distress. Washing your hands before handling your hamster will help him feel more comfortable. Use an unscented soap—a fruit-scented soap may make your hamster see your hand as food. Washing your hands is especially important if you have more than one hamster. The scent of another hamster on your hands could make the hamster you are handling feel like he is being attacked. In the wild, hamsters have few defenses other than running. Any sudden changes in your hamster's environment can be very alarming to him, so it is very important that he can see your hand approaching him. When you place your hand in your hamster's cage, leave it there for at least a few seconds so that he can acclimate to it. It is very important for your hamster to feel secure in your hands when you hold him. When he climbs into your hand, cup your hand under him to support him. Cup your other hand so that he can rest comfortably and securely in the palms of both of your hands.  If your hamster does not want to climb in your hands, consider using a scoop. Allow him to walk into the scoop before lifting him up. You can them transfer him from the scoop to your hand when you have him out of the cage.  You can also use a 1-liter plastic soda bottle, cut in half, like a scoop. Place the bottom half of the bottle in your hand, and let your hamster crawl into it. He will feel the warmth of your hand, but will not be able to bite your hand through the plastic. Make sure the bottle's edges are smooth. With time, your hamster will become more comfortable with being held and you will not need to lift him with a scoop. Being lifted up can be very disorienting and frightening for your hamster. Before lifting him up, face him towards you in your hands. This will give him a frame of reference and will make him less likely to jump, as you lift him up. Lift him up  slowly  and  gently.   Be aware that your hamster may start biting your hand as you lift him up. His bites will likely not be enough to break the skin but will serve as more of a warning signal that he is feeling alarmed.  If he starts to bite, gently blow a puff of air in his face. The hamster will take a step back and blink, wondering what he just smelled. This gives you time to free your hand from his grip. Keeping your hamster close to your body as you hold him will keep him safe. It will also prevent him from trying to run or jump away. Because your hamster is not used to being held, he will probably not want to be held for long periods of time. If he seems agitated or is trying to bite you, gently lower him back in his cage.  Gently lower your hamster back in his cage. Hamsters can easily injure themselves if they fall, so you should lower your hamster until he can easily walk out of your hands and onto the bottom of his cage. You can spread out your palm and allow him to simply step off your hand. Hold him for a short period of time initially (less than a minute), then work your way to longer stretches of time as he becomes more comfortable with being held."

      "Rapid prompting involves continuously asking questions to the autistic person, and letting them answer using writing, pointing to a letter board, speaking, or whatever works best. It encourages the autistic person to communicate and engage with the world more. RDI focuses on developing skills such as theory of mind, independent thinking, consideration of others, and more. It is a long-term therapy. Behavioral therapy can teach rote tasks using extrinsic rewards, and can be useful for concrete skills such as hand-washing, listening to the word \"stop,\" and tying shoes. Unfortunately, there are many stories of goals that involve compliance, forced normalization, and abuse. Choose therapists carefully and make sure the focus is on teaching your loved one skills, not on forcing them to conform. CBT is a form of talk therapy that can help identify distorted thoughts, such as \"Everybody will laugh at me if I flap my hands\" or \"I am a burden to my family,\" and evaluate their accuracy. An occupational therapist can work with you and/or your loved one to provide strategies to meet the autistic person's needs.  A sensory diet is a set of activities to do at home, like climbing trees, finger painting, swinging, blowing bubbles, et cetera. It can help meet the autistic person's needs and acclimate them to various stimuli. It can also be a lot of fun. The therapist can also help redirect harmful stims (e.g. hitting one's head) towards ones that fulfill the same need without causing harm (e.g. hitting a pillow, applying deep pressure to the head). There is no scientific evidence that any of them are helpful at all, some involve specific risks, but certain people find them useful. The following is a list of treatments that fit this category and examples of what they may involve:  Energy therapy - reiki, acupuncture, Therapeutic Touch Alternative medical systems - aromatherapy, homeopathy Manipulative and body-based method - deep pressure, acupressure, hydro massage Mind-body intervention - auditory integration, meditation, dance therapy Biologically based therapy - using herbs, special diet, and vitamins  Always consult a doctor before making a major change to your own or a loved one's diet or lifestyle. Some alternative therapies, such as chelation therapy or MMS, are potentially deadly. If the autistic person is upset by the therapy, or fails to improve, find a new therapy. From common snake oil peddlers to certified BCBAs, there are people who will distort truths and support ideas that can harm you or your loved one. Trust your instincts, don't let fearmongering make you panic, and don't continue a therapy if you think it is upsetting you or your loved one too much.  Therapy should not be extremely painful or distressing. A therapist should take the patient's unhappiness seriously. 40 hours per week of therapy is as intense as a full-time job. This can be overwhelming. Small children do not have adult attention spans. Your child will be fine with 1-2 hours per day or less, and there's no rush.  Transparency is a reasonable request. Therapists should not prevent you from witnessing a situation, or dodge your questions. People who claim to cure autism are not being honest. Autism is probably genetic, not caused by vaccines or parasites. Your instincts matter. If a therapist is telling you to ignore your gut feeling, that you're being irrational, or that you would intervene if you saw what they were doing to your loved one, this is a problem.",
      "Health care providers rely on behavioral symptoms and/or written questionnaires during routine checkups. There are screening tests that can also be done during these visits. If your doctor does not regularly screen for autism, ask for her to do so. There is no one-size-fits-all approach for autism. Tailor treatment to the individual's needs. Stop asking \"What do autistic people need?” and instead ask “What does this specific person need?”  For example, one autistic person may have excellent self-care skills and above-average school performance, but need sensory integration therapy and social skills training. Another might be highly social but unable to care for herself and in need of counseling for depression. While there is no cure for autism, some of its challenging aspects and comorbid conditions can be helped through medication.   Anxiety Elevated energy level Self-injurious behavior Inability to concentrate Depression Seizures Severe outburst of anger or aggression  Many autistic people also experience comorbid disabilities/health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, epilepsy, digestive issues, depression, ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and more. These are all treatable.",
      "Autistic people can undergo tremendous amounts of pressure to perform \"normally,\" and the best way to help them is to respect them. Make it clear that you will listen to them. If they feel supported at home, they will communicate and adapt better, and feel happy. Children learn to understand speech by hearing others speak, and talking to an uncommunicative person will encourage them to open up (even if the conversations are fairly one-sided for now). If you know what their special interests are, start conversations about them. Read their body language as you talk to them. For example, if you ask your daughter \"Did you play with your friends today?\" and she squeals happily and waves her arms, this is her answer. This communication is a stepping stone and should be encouraged. Act with the assumption that your loved one can hear and understand you, even if it doesn't look like it. Treat them like they are fundamentally good and intelligent. Positive expectations can help them bloom. If your loved one is in the room, assume they can hear what you're saying. If you talk about how hard it is to live with an autistic child, they'll worry that they make your life worse by existing. Save your adult fears for when the children are out of the room. Let them know that they're autistic. This can help them have words for their experiences, and dispel any confusion that they're \"broken\" or \"bad.\" Let them know that they're just different, that this is okay, and you love them for who they are."

      "Understanding Serving Sizes",

      "Consuming Recommended Amounts Based on Daily Values"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Serving size refers to how much of an item you are intended to eat in a single meal. Every number listed beneath “total fat” is calculated based on the amount contained in a single serving. So if the saturated fat on a label is listed at 6 grams but the number of servings is listed as 3, it means that there are a total of 18 grams of saturated fat in the container. Serving sizes are paired with the metric amount for each serving. This is helpful if you're trying to figure out how healthy a serving will be compared to how filling it is probably going to be. Knowing the servings per container is essential to understanding the rest of the numbers on a food label. When a label lists percentages for fat, cholesterol, sodium, or protein, they're referring to the percentage in a single individual serving. So if a jar of salsa has 10% of your daily serving of sodium but there are 20 servings in the jar, then the entire jar contains 200% of your daily recommended sodium intake. Knowing how you're going to use a food item is going to inform how you interpret the daily values. For example, if you're going to use an entire can of pinto beans in a chili recipe, and you know that there are 4 servings in the can but you're feeding 2 people, multiply each daily value by 4 and then divide by 2 to figure out how much fat, sodium, or cholesterol each person is going to consume. Using the serving size to interpret daily values is important because most people don't measure out specific servings when eating; knowing how much fat or sodium is in an entire package is easier to conceptualize for a lot of people.",
      "A calorie is a unit of energy, and can come from a variety of different sources. How many calories you consume in a day determines how much energy you provide for your body. If you consume too many calories on a daily basis, you can gain weight as the energy is converted to fat. If you eat fewer calories than your body needs, you can burn fat and lose weight.  Ingredients that are calorie-dense, like butter, oil, or sugar, tend to be bad for you. Foods that tend to have a low caloric content are usually good for you, like avocado, celery, or corn. Empty calories refer to calories that are low in nutritional value, like pizza, soda, or sausage. The next row on the label is fat, and it is accompanied by 2 different types of fat underneath the total number content. Fat helps provide cell development and stores energy in the body. It is found in a lot of plants and animals, and isn't necessarily bad for you if you don't have too much of it.  Saturated fat refers to fats that come from animals. They are worse for your body than unsaturated fats. Trans fats are a kind of unsaturated fat found in oils. They are especially bad for you, and you should avoid foods with a lot of trans fat in them at all costs. Cholesterol is a fat-like material that occurs naturally in your body. You need some forms of cholesterol to regulate hormones, but too much cholesterol can increase your risk for heart disease. Avoid foods with high cholesterol values whenever you can to keep your heart happy and healthy.  There are 3 main types of cholesterol: HDL, LDL, and VLDL. They refer to the density of the cholesterol. Your body needs some HDL to keep your liver healthy, but LDL and VLDL should be avoided. Red meats and junk foods tend to be high in cholesterol. Under cholesterol, you can find the sodium content in a single serving. Sodium is found in salt, and your body needs less than 500 milligrams a day. Too much sodium can cause your blood pressure to rise, which can increase your risk of stroke, heart failure, osteoporosis, and cancer. Stay away from foods that are high in sodium whenever you can.  If you're trying to cut down on sodium, consider cutting soda and junk food out of your diet completely. Try to consume less than 20% of your daily value in sodium every day. Carbohydrates are nutrients that produce calories. They generate fuel for the nervous system and muscles, and help your body metabolize fats. Carbohydrates can be bad for you if they come from a source that is high in fat, sodium, or cholesterol (such as some pasta dishes, pizza, or dairy products).  Eating too many carbohydrates can put you at risk of weight gain and type 2 diabetes. Not eating enough carbohydrates can result in hypoglycemia or energy loss. Fiber is a nutrient found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. Fiber helps your digestive tract and aids in the burning of fat. Eating fiber is a good way to promote a healthy diet, and foods that tend to be high in fiber are usually very good for you. Aim to consume at least 20-30 grams of fiber every day.  Fiber can also counteract high cholesterol levels if you consume enough of it on a daily basis. There are fiber supplements that you can take to artificially raise your fiber intake every day. There are 2 types of sugar, natural and added sugar. Natural sugars are found in fruit and dairy products and aren't bad for you in small amounts. Added sugars are harder for your body to digest, and should be avoided whenever possible. Natural sugars usually come in foods that are high in fiber or protein, while added sugars are can lead to weight gain, heart problems, or type 2 diabetes. Added sugars are only listed on some food labels. To make sure that there are no added sugars, look for the phrase “sugar free” printed on a container or check for corn sweetener, high-fructose corn syrup, or sugar in the ingredients list. Protein is a nutrient that promotes muscle growth and health. It is often found in meat, but also appears naturally in nuts, legumes, and eggs. Protein also helps the immune system and aids your body's metabolism. Don't focus exclusively on a food's protein content though, since a lot of high-protein foods often come alongside high fat, sodium, or cholesterol contents.  Try to get protein in foods that are also low in carbohydrates or calories. Seafood, vegetables, and lean meats are all excellent sources of protein. You can increase your daily protein intake by mixing protein powder into shakes if you want to get enough protein without increasing the amount that you're eating every day. Under the protein or fiber, you'll see a black bar separating another set of ingredients. These are vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that are found in the food. The most common inclusions are vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. These nutrients are good for you, and if the list under this black bar is longer, then the food is probably healthy for you.  Vitamin A helps promote vision and keeps your immune and reproductive systems operating at a healthy level. It also helps your lungs, kidneys, and other organs functioning normally.  Vitamin C helps repair body tissue and promotes healthy skin.  Calcium keeps your bones healthy and strong. It also helps blood clot and makes it easier for muscles to contract. Calcium consumption is important when you're young.  Iron transports oxygen in your blood and helps to convert nutrients into energy. If you're iron deficient, you could become anemic.",
      "2,000 calories is the recommended daily amount for women and 2,500 is the recommended daily amount for men. Each daily value percentage is based on these caloric intakes. You may want to consume more calories every day if you're using more energy than the average person, but you may want to consume fewer than 2,000 calories if you're dieting. Change the way you interpret the daily values based on how many calories you're trying to consume every day. If you're trying to cut down on calories, 20% of your daily value in fat is high. If you're trying to consume more calories every day, 20% may be on the lower side. Keep your fat intake under 100% of the recommended value. 65% is a healthy number to shoot for, but you may want to consume a little more if you're low on energy or trying to build muscle mass. Saturated fat should account for less than 7% of your daily caloric intake. Butter, oils, pastries, and red meat tends to be high in saturated fat. Avoid eating these foods more than once a day. Try to only consume around 65% of your daily value in cholesterol and try to eat foods that are low in LDL or VLDL. HDL foods include fruit, fish, beans, and whole grains. Consuming a single fast food meal or large steak can single-handedly send you over 100% of your daily value in cholesterol.  An easy way to consume good cholesterol is to replace red meats with fish and use olive oil instead of salad dressing. Your cholesterol intake should never exceed 300 mg a day. 20% of your daily value in sodium (per serving) is considered high. This means that with 3 meals in a day, you should keep your sodium intake under 60%. If you can't, try to avoid exceeding 100% of your daily value (2,300 milligrams). Pizza, hot dogs, breads, and processed meats tend to be extremely high in sodium, so avoid these foods whenever you can. Avoid adding salt to meats and eggs when you're cooking. Adding salt to a dish is the easiest way to go over 100% of your recommended daily value. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, avoid getting under 900 or more than 1,300 calories from carbohydrates a day. If you don't eat enough carbohydrates, you'll feel lethargic as your blood sugar drops. If you eat too many, you can gain weight and feel bloated throughout your day. Vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products are excellent sources of carbohydrates. You need at least 25 grams of fiber every day to come from the food you consume. An easy way to reach this goal is to consume at least 1 serving of whole grains with every meal that you eat. Fruit and vegetables tend to be high in fiber as well. While 25 grams is 100% of the recommended value, 30 grams of fiber is a good goal if you eat more than 2,000 calories a day. Sugar can be tricky because you want some natural sugars in your diet, but added sugars should be avoided at all cost. Most fruits contain a little natural sugar, and can provide a healthy snack or side dish.  There is no daily recommended value for sugar. Added sugars include artificial sweeteners and corn syrups. Look for “sugar free” on food containers to ensure that you're eating food with no added sugars. This label doesn't mean that there isn't any natural sugar in it though. Proteins do not have a daily value listed because where they come from is more important than how much protein there is. Generally speaking, the threshold for protein intake is generally 25-35 grams per meal. Get your protein from sources that are low in cholesterol and fat, like fish, grains, beans, and vegetables. Protein is essential when it comes to promoting healthy muscle growth and maintaining a good energy level throughout your day. When it comes to nutrients, 5% or less is considered low and 20% or higher is considered high. This means that an item that lists its fat content at 4% can be considered to be low fat. However, if there are 6 servings in the item and you plan on eating the entire thing, the fat content will suddenly become high (at 24%). Keep in mind that you do not need to consume 100% of a daily value of bad nutrients to stay healthy.  100% of a daily value is a limit, not a goal. Trans fat and saturated fat are listed separately under fat because they're especially bad for you. Avoid these fats whenever possible. Vitamin A, C, iron, and calcium are all good for your body. 100% of the daily value in these nutrients is a minimum, not a threshold. Dried fruits, nuts, grains, yogurts, and vegetables all tend to be high in these nutrients. You can also take supplements to make sure that you get at least 100% of these nutrients every day. On boxes or cans with bigger labels, there is a section all the way at the bottom that contains footnotes on the total recommended amounts of each item on the list. The column on the left is based on a daily diet of 2,000 calories, and the column on the right is for 2,500 calories. The 2 biggest offenders when it comes to unhealthy ingredients are added sugars and high fructose corn syrup. Check the ingredients list for these items when scanning a food label and try to avoid them whenever possible.  The ingredients list will literally say “added sugars.” The word “sugar” is used to refer to natural sugars and aren't necessarily bad for you. Less than 5% of your daily caloric intake should come from added sugars."

      "When you're looking at the basic form and structure of a piece of writing, consider how that affects the telling of the story. Ask yourself if the story could have been told in another format and how it could have been told from a different perspective.  For example, you may be close reading an epic poem. The poem tells a story, but the fact that it's written in poetry rather than prose may detract from the story rather than enhance it. You might also consider whether that particular form or structure is unpopular or uncommon. If the text is written in some rare form, that may make it less accessible and detract from the story or the message the author is trying to convey. Consider also any disruptions or differences between the author's use of the form and the traditional form. Any deviations from the standard may be intended to set a particular tone, or they may serve a purpose within the writing itself. If you notice this deviations, think about whether they help or hurt the piece. Great authors have a distinct personal style that they bring to their work. Beyond that, a particular style may lend itself more to one type of story than another. Punctuation, sentence length, and paragraph structure are all part of the writer's style.  For example, Ernest Hemingway wrote direct, concise sentences. His writing style lent itself well to the action-packed stories that he wrote. However, that sort of writing style might not work very well in a romance novel. Assume that every aspect of the author's writing style was carefully and deliberately chosen to serve the story as a whole. Ask yourself how the style works with the subject matter and theme of the work itself. Poets and fictional prose writers are more likely to use patterns and repetition to reinforce themes in the work or make particular details stand out. Patterns can also be used to evoke a particular mood in the reader.  When you identify patterns, ask yourself why the author employed that particular pattern. Judge whether it actually serves the purpose the author intended, or whether it's distracting. You may also notice patterns in non-fiction writing, in terms of a particular item or event that keeps coming up over and over again. Out of all the tools in a writer's toolbox, word choice can be the most powerful. Particularly if the author has used an unusual or archaic term, think about why that particular word was chosen over any other.  For example, suppose you're close reading a passage in which the protagonist has entered a library. The author refers to the volumes on the shelves as \"tomes\" rather than \"books.\" This word evokes an entirely different image in most readers' heads. Ask yourself if that image is in keeping with the overall feel of the book itself. Word choice and language in dialogue is used to create characters and tell you something about their personality. In a good piece of writing, the characters won't all talk in the same way. They'll each have their own rhythm and verbal tics, just as real people do. Think about how the language of the characters helps build those characters into individuals, and if the characters are dynamic or flat. Syntax is, generally, the way a piece of writing is arranged using grammar and punctuation. You'll notice this more when you read aloud than when you're reading silently. Reading a passage aloud gives you a better sense of the rhythm and flow of the words. Just be sure to pay attention to the punctuation so you know when to pause.  If you notice any unusual sentence structures, think about what effect this is meant to have on the reader. You might also notice an abrupt change in sentence structure, such as a one-word sentence. Typically the change is intended to emphasize or draw your attention to something. Think about what your attention is drawn to and why that might be important. Particularly if you're reading poetry or fiction, someone is telling you a story. Who is telling that story, and why, and what their limitations are, can impact the story itself.  If you're reading a story written in first person, think about the narrator and their reasons for telling this story. Separate aspects of the story they would know from other parts of the story that are merely speculation or conjecture on the narrator's part. Ask yourself whether the narrator is reliable, and why or why not. If you're reading something written in third person, determine whether the narrator is limited or omniscient. If you have an omniscient third-person narrator, consider whether knowing the inner thoughts and motivations of all the characters helps or hinders the story. It can also help your analysis to imagine the story being told from a different point of view. For example, how would the story of \"The Great Gatsby\" be different if it was told from Daisy's point of view? Questions that start with how and why are some of your most valuable questions as you explore a text more deeply with close reading. Don't take anything as assumed, or trust it just because that's what you were told by the author (or the narrator).  Don't worry about getting the \"right\" answer to these questions. While there may be an interpretation of a text that is commonly (or even universally) accepted, that doesn't make it the only correct interpretation, as long as you can support your interpretation with information from the text. You may have access to the author's interpretation, and what they intended when they wrote the text you've read. However, the author's interpretation is not the only interpretation. It's perfectly legitimate for you to get something different out of the text than what the author intended.",
      "Every author who sits down to write something – be it a work of non-fiction, a poem, or a work of fiction – has a reason for doing so. They have information they want to convey to you, or a story they want to tell. Sometimes the author's true purpose is obscured within the writing itself. For example, fiction writers may use an allegory or satire to make a political point or say something about society. Understanding who the author was and the time period when they were writing can help you better analyze the text and place it in context with other works.  The author's background can be important in evaluating your own reaction to the work. For example, historical attitudes about gender, sexuality, and religion may seem strange or even offensive to modern-day readers. As part of your research into the author's background, you should also try to find out what other authors they were associated with. You may want to read some of the work of those other authors to better understand how your author's style developed and evolved. Different pieces of writing often borrow ideas, images, and themes from other works that came before. If you're reading something written more recently, you may find connections to films or television shows as well.  Think about the purpose behind those connections. Consider whether the connection was intentionally made by the author, or was just circumstantial. Sometimes authors connect to pre-existing works as a short-cut to build a particular mood or image in the reader's mind. For example, if you're reading a short story about a mad scientist who is designing a theme park, one of the characters might mention Jurassic Park. Assuming you're familiar with Jurassic Park, you already have a fully formed image in your head that the author didn't have to create from scratch. A text that is a candidate for close reading typically is one that speaks to a particular aspect of existence and of the human condition. After you've gone deep into the text itself, bring it back out into the world and think about what it contributes to human understanding.  Ask yourself what the text as a whole causes you to think or wonder about. In some cases, it may be that after reading the text you're left with more questions than you have answers. If you're tasked with writing an essay or other paper on the text, this sort of big-picture thinking can help you find the theme for your paper.",
      "When you close read, you start with the text itself. While you may already be familiar with the author, close reading requires you to initially view the text in isolation.  Try to put anything you already know about the history or background of the text to the side. For at least your first few readings, don't consider anything outside the text. If the text is short, it’s best to read it at least 3 or 4 times. Read it through once, as you normally would, for comprehension. Then you're ready to dive into a close reading. After a quick read-through, you should have a general idea what the text you just read is about. You may want to jot down a few words that describe the main idea or theme of what you just read. You might also notice a particular image or idea that recurs throughout the text. A recurring image may have symbolic meaning. Make note of these as well. If the text is short, you can take notes during your second read-through. If it’s long, you can take notes as you read the first time. Go slowly and annotate the text as you read, underlining key words and making notes in the margins.  If something is confusing to you or doesn't make sense, put a question mark next to the line. You may also want to jot down a thought or question that you have about it. Make notes in the margins (or on a separate sheet of paper if you're reading from a library book) discussing your thoughts and reactions to the text as you read. Think of yourself as in a conversation with the author of the text. Be careful not to highlight or underline too much. If you find yourself thinking that everything is important, stop and read through it again to find the purpose of the work before you start annotating. As you're reading, the text will make you feel a certain way. Keep tabs on how the text is making you feel, and dig into why the text is affecting you that way. You might also make notes if it brings up things in your own life.  For example, if you are reading a passage about a young woman attending university for the first time, it might bring up memories of your own first days of school. Depending on how that experience was for you, the passage may make you feel wistful, anxious, or nostalgic. Some passages you read may stir up feelings of anger or resentment based on your religious, political, or ethical beliefs. Note these as well. Later on when you're putting the work in context, you can evaluate the author's intentions or reasons for including those passages in the work. Having to guess at the meaning of a word can destroy your understanding of the text. Particularly if you're reading something written hundreds of years ago, words used may have a different meaning than they do now. Be sure to specify the meaning based on the context of the work.  Some words also may have different meanings depending on the context in which they are used. In some disciplines, such as sociology or law, you may encounter common words that are actually terms of art that have a specialized meaning within that field. Keep a list of words you have to look up so you can refer to it later. This can also help you increase your vocabulary. At this point, you'll have a general reaction to the text as a whole. You may like it or dislike it, or you may have a more emotional reaction to the subject matter. In some cases, you may find that you enjoyed reading something that you ordinarily wouldn't have been interested in.  You can use deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, or a mixture of both. Take note of your process and the reasons behind your reasoning when considering how to react to the text or parts of it. Dig into your reactions and think about why you had the reaction you did. For example, you may have related to the subject matter personally. It may be something you know a lot about or have strong feelings about. If your reaction is based on something outside the text, such as your personal feelings or beliefs, you may want to put that aside while you analyze the text itself. You can come back to it later when you're putting the work in context."

      "Everyone is eligible for colon cancer screening beginning at the age of 50; however, if you have a family history of colon cancer, or a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, both of which increase your risk of developing colon cancer) you may be eligible to begin screening earlier. Don't wait to discuss this with your doctor — even if you are still young, it is important to notify your doctor if you have any risk factors. See your doctor at age 50 to begin self-screening, and earlier if you believe you have additional risk factors (in which case your doctor will let you know at what age you are eligible to begin). The first thing you will need to do in order to self-screen for colon cancer is to obtain the at-home stool testing package. You will need to visit your family doctor to obtain this, and she will explain the procedure to you during this visit as well.  One stool test is called the Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT). This looks for blood in your stool that is not visible to the naked eye. It is the most commonly used self-screening test for colon cancer.  Another stool test option is called the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). This is almost the same as FOBT, except instead of detecting blood via heme it detects it via antibodies directed at human hemoglobin.  The final self-screening stool test option is called Cologuard. This evaluates both for the presence of blood in the stool, as well as for DNA that has been correlated to a higher risk for colon cancer. It is quite new and therefore not currently recommended as the standard of care; however, studies indicate that the new Cologuard test could potentially have a greater ability to detect colon cancer than either the FOBT or the FIT tests. Once you have the package at home with you, you are ready to begin testing at the time of your next bowel movement. Take note of how many stool samples you will need. Some self-screening packages request three samples, often each the size of a smear on a piece of toilet paper. Others ask for only one sample, but it may require the whole bowel movement to be packaged and sent into the lab.  One way to collect bowel samples more easily is to place a piece of plastic wrap over the toilet bowl, allowing it to hang just above the water level. After your bowel movement, you can then collect the stool sample (in the required amount) before flushing the rest down the toilet. Ensure that no urine contaminates your stool sample. It is important to store your stool sample at room temperature until you have a chance to return it to the lab. This should be done within seven days following the collection of your stool sample. After you have collected your sample and placed it in the appropriate areas of the packaging, you will need to return it to the lab for analysis. The address of the lab should be listed on the side of the package — normally, you can return it to any medical lab in your area, or to the hospital lab, whichever is most convenient for you to get to. After the lab has finished analyzing your stool, you will want to go in to see your family doctor again to review the results of your stool test. Depending on whether the result is positive (suspicious for possible colon cancer) or negative (not worrisome), your doctor will help you to plan your next steps, if any further investigative steps need to be taken.",
      "If the result of your stool test comes back as negative for blood (or DNA), you can take confidence in knowing that your risk of colon cancer at this time is very low. Of course, no test is perfect, so there is always the slight possibility of a testing error, but more likely than not you are not at risk. Your doctor will advise you to proceed with your life as normal. No further testing will be indicated at this time.  The stool test is generally repeated every one to two years for people 50 and older, in order to ensure regular screening.  Make a note to yourself to follow up with your family doctor again at this time for a repeat stool test. If the result of your stool test comes back positive, you will need to proceed with further investigations at this time. The next step is a colonoscopy, which is where a tube is inserted through the anus all the way up your colon so that your doctor can directly visualize the walls of the colon and look for any suspicious lesions or polyps. If there are any, these can be biopsied at the time of the test and evaluated under the microscope for the presence of cancer.  If your colonoscopy shows nothing suspicious, you are in the clear and safe to go on with life as normal. If your colonoscopy reveals colon cancer, you will need to consult a medical oncologist (a cancer specialist) about how best to treat you colon cancer. It is important not to get overly worried about a screening test. This is because the purpose of the screening test is not to diagnose cancer, but rather, to figure out who is at a higher risk and as such needs to have a colonoscopy (which is the official diagnostic test).  If you test positive for blood in your stool, there is a chance that you have colon cancer, but it is not diagnostic. If possible, try not to worry too much until you have followed through with the actual colonoscopy. Also, the good news is that, if you receive regular screening, colon cancer can be caught early in the stages where it can be treated and cured (90% of colon cancers caught early are able to be cured)."

      "If you don't mind adding holes to your wall, you can simply screw hooks into the wall. Space them at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart horizontally, so your necklaces don't get tangled. You can even hide them somewhere, such as behind a hinged mirror or behind the clothes in your closet. Measure your necklaces so you know how long they are. That way, you leave enough space between rows if you need more than one row. You can find key holders at big box stores, thrift stores, and home organization stores. One usually consists of a small plaque with hooks at the bottom to hang keys from. Since the hooks are already built in, all you need to do is hang up the key holder and put your necklaces on it. Place the holder somewhere convenient, such as in your bathroom or closet. Find decorative drawer knobs at home improvement stores, flea markets, and/or big box stores. Screw them into a piece of flat driftwood in a row about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Hang the necklaces on the knobs. This hanging method is decorative, so you can simply hang it on the wall by your bed or closet. If you don't have more than 5 or 10 necklaces, a jewelry tree can be a good option. You can find these at craft stores, big box stores, or online. They have branches where you can hang your necklaces as you go.  This option usually doesn't work for more necklaces because jewelry trees usually don't have enough branches to hang them all individually. You can also create your own jewelry tree from tree branches. Gather tree branches from your yard. Arrange them in a heavy, pretty vase. You may need to add glass beads to the vase to weigh the branches down. Choose a piece of sturdy cork board. Stretch fabric over it one way, and attach it to the back with thumbtacks or staples. Stretch it the other way, and secure it to the back with thumbtacks or staples. Smooth out any wrinkles and secure the fabric at the corners. Add thumb tacks to the front to hang your necklaces from. Place the cork board on a vanity or dresser, and lean it against the wall for easy placement. Pick up some branches from your backyard or a nearby park. Use yarn or zip-ties where 2 branches meet to secure them together in an arrangement you like. Hang the branches on the wall, and hang your necklaces from the branches. Paint an old drawer or shadow box in a color you like. Cover the inside panel with cork board, and then decorate the cork board with fabric or paint. Use pins or thumbtacks to hang your necklaces from, and hang the drawer or shadow box on the wall. Alternatively, screw or glue in knobs to hang necklaces from. Screw a towel rod into the wall or a door. Hang s-shaped shower hooks on the towel rod, and spread them out evenly. Place your necklaces on the hooks, lining them up by style or color. A pocket organizer is a piece of fabric with pockets in it and a hook at the top. Place a necklace in each pocket, arranged by color or style. Hang the organizer in an easily accessible place. Some of these organizers have zippers on the pockets, making the organizer a breeze to take with you on trips.",
      "Choose a large decorative tray that's wide enough to hold your necklaces length-wise. Lay them out in a row in the tray, organizing by color or style as you go. The tray doesn't need to be made for jewelry. Try using a vintage serving tray, for instance. No matter where you buy jewelry, you often end up with small cardboard boxes. Use paperclips to attach them together. Set 2 bottoms side-by-side, and put the paperclip over the joined edges. Lay the boxes out in shallow drawer or tray. Place a necklace in each jewelry box. It's fine to let costume jewelry be out in the open, but you should protect more expensive jewelry from dust and damage. Place each necklace in its own jewelry box, and put the boxes away for safe keeping. You can also use jewelry boxes that have individual spaces for necklaces. Many of these are decorative and will look lovely sitting on a dresser or vanity.",
      "Cut a straw down one side with a box cutter or craft knife to create one long slit. Thread one side of the necklace through the slit so that side of the necklace is held in place by the straw. The straw will help keep the necklace from tangling with other necklaces.  Lay the necklaces out flat in the drawer. Line the bottom of the drawer with a piece of velvet to keep the necklaces from sliding around. Fasten the ends shut so the strands aren't loose. Find trays with long slots in them that you can lay in the drawers. Your necklaces can go in the trays, keeping them safe and organized. You can even use plastic silverware dividers for this purpose. Spice jars usually have just enough space to fit a single necklace. Put one necklace in each jar, and place them in your drawer. Place a non-skid surface underneath to keep the jars from sliding around.  Some spice jars are magnetic, so if you prefer, you can use the magnets to attach them to a mirror or metal surface instead of putting them in the drawer. Stick to beaded necklaces, as delicate necklaces might get tangled up in the jars. Grab an old teacup from your kitchen, and place your everyday necklaces in it. Alternatively, if you have a deeper drawer with extra space, you can line multiple teacups up in the drawer. Place a necklace in each cup to keep them organized."

      "This is an important first step for further training. Begin calling your dog by its name as soon as you adopt it. Even though the dog won't understand that you are talking about it right away, the repetition over time will help it to learn that you are talking about it. Pick a name for your dog that is easy to say. This will allow you to teach the dog its name more easily. This is an important bit of training that is key to having a happy and healthy relationship with your pet. House training a dog is a bit different than teaching commands. Dogs instinctually want to keep their bathroom spot separate from where they sleep and eat. Because of this, house training a dog is more about showing the dog the boundaries of home and bathroom than directing the dog when to go to the bathroom.  The key to house training is taking your dog out on a regular basis. When you first begin training your dog, there will probably be accidents between trips outside, as the dog is not used to the routine yet. However, over time the dog's system will adjust to the regular intervals between trips outside. If a dog goes to the bathroom in the house, immediately take it outside to finish its business. The important part of this is taking the dog outside immediately. A dog doesn't have the ability to make a connection between going to the bathroom inside and being taken outside unless these things happen basically simultaneously. Dobermans, like all dogs, need to be socialized at a young age. This means that you must take your puppy to parks, dog-friendly stores, and other places your pup will meet new people. You want your puppy to constantly be meeting new people, so that it understands that this is a normal, and pleasant, part of life. If your puppy goes with little socialization, he or she will not be friendly to other dogs in the future. This will prove to be a major problem. If you adopt an adult dog that has not been socialized you should begin remedial socialization with them. This means that you need to start with the basics to get them used to people and animals out in the world.  Start by building trust with the animal. It needs to trust and follow your commands in order to be trained how to respond to strangers and other animals. Once you have bonded with your adult dog, then start doing short excursions into public. You should keep your dog away from actual contact with strangers and animals at first, simply letting the dog see that others out in the world mean it no harm. Gradually introduce the dog to new people. Get a friend to help with this training. Have the person stand near the dog in a non-threatening position, but not so close that the dog could actually make contact. Have your helper use a kind voice and hold treats for the dog, so that it gradually goes to the helper on its own. Also introduce your dog to other dogs. This is a delicate and gradual process, in which the dog first needs to see and smell the other dog before being allowed to get close enough to make contact with the other dog. This may take quite awhile if your dog is aggressive to other dogs. Over days, and probably weeks, gradually expose your dog to the sights and smells of other dogs.",
      "Get your dog into a standing position and position yourself in its line of sight. Focus the dog's attention on a treat in your hand. Raise that hand in front of the dog’s nose to let it get the scent, then to above its head level. When you hold the treat above the dog’s head, most dogs will naturally sit to get a better view of it.  Give the dog an immediate treat and praise. Follow the routine of treat and praise and say “good sit” when the dog is performing the behavior. Your pup may be slow at first, but more treats and praise will speed up its response. Make sure that you do not praise the dog until its actually sitting. If you praise halfway through the sit, the dog will think that is what you want. Also, make sure that you do not praise it for getting back up, or you will get that behavior instead of the sit. If your dog does not sit with the treat technique, you can use your leash and collar. Stand next to the dog, facing the same direction as it. Place a little backward pressure on the collar to encourage a sit. You may even need to encourage the sit by adding a little gentle scoop behind the dog’s hind legs. Gently lean the dog backward with the help of the collar while doing this. As soon as it sits, give the dog immediate praise and reward. Praise natural sitting behavior. Look for times throughout the day when your dog just sits on his own. Praise that behavior, and pretty soon you'll have a dog that sits for attention instead of jumping or barking at you. The “come” is used whenever you want your dog to come to you. This command is potentially life-saving, as it can prevent your dog from running off if he gets loose. Begin by getting your dog’s attention. You want to make it run toward you. Use praise and your “happy voice” to encourage the dog to move toward you. Once the dog comes, give immediate praise.  Pair the behavior with the verbal command. As your dog begins to realize it will be rewarded for coming to you, start giving the verbal command “come.” When it responds to the command, reinforce it in praise by pairing it with “good”: “good come!” Move the training to more public spaces. Because the “come” command could save your dog's life, it must learn to respond to it even when it's distracted. Move the training sessions from your home or yard to a public park. There are more sights, sounds, and smells demanding his attention there. Give enormous rewards. Because this command is so important, the praise you give for performing it should be extravagant. Responding to the \"come\" command should be the best part of your dog's day. Take your dog on regular walks with a leash. This is important not just for training, but for its physical and mental health. Depending on what breed of dog you have, the dog may need a lot of exercise to keep it happy and in shape.  Discourage pulling. Most dogs will pull on the leash when they're learning to take walks. When it starts pulling, stop immediately. Don't take another step until the dog comes to your side and focuses its attention on you. Change directions. An even more effective method is to walk in the opposite direction and encourage your dog to come with you. Once it has caught up, praise and treat it. Make it fun to be by your side. Your dog's natural impulse is to chart its own course and investigate its environment. You need to make walking by your side more appealing that that. Use an enthusiastic voice when changing directions, and lavish the dog with praise when it comes back to your side. Pair the behavior with a verbal command. Once the dog walks consistently at your side, you can give the behavior a name, like “heel\" or “let’s go.”",
      "A young Dobie will not need much more than a collar. As your dog ages, however, you will notice its strength increase. For most females dogs this is not a problem, but for the deeper-chested males you may need to purchase a head collar. A head collar is best because it establishes dominance. While using the head collar, you walk right next to your dog's head. The head collar is much like a horse halter. Instead of constantly pulling the collar and being dragged the Gentle Leader, a great brand of head collar, only needs a quick, sharp pull to control the dog.  Most dogs take a while to get used to the head collar, but if you are doing it right it will not hurt them. Make sure you follow all the instructions given to you when you purchase the head collar. Gentle leaders are available at your local pet store. Pinch collars are also effective, but establish a bond based on fear. These should be used as a last resort. Solid training will eliminate any need for a pinch collar. Give your dog a reward when it does something correctly instead of punishing them when they do something wrong. Reward-based training helps your dog create a positive link between the desirable action and getting a reward. The dog then learns what actions go with what cues and carries out the actions in order to earn a reward. This is a humane and highly effective training method.  Dobies have a strong food drive but overfeeding can lead to health and behavior problems. Try toys instead, because food aggression is common with Dobies. When your dog does misbehave, because all dogs misbehave sometimes, try to get to the bottom of the behavior. If you know why the dog is doing bad things, you can possibly alleviate the problem, and thus the bad behavior. If all else fails, get rid of temptation for the dog. Move items it destroys or eats out of its space, so that you are not setting the dog up to fail. Doberman need firm handling. Many people take that instruction as an excuse to be mean to their dog. Firm handling just means that the Doberman is a fairly dominant dog, and needs to be taught right from wrong at an early age. Teach your Doberman that you are its leader when it is a puppy, because being bossed around by a large dog isn't fun.  Dogs can detect and reflect the emotions around them. So if your dog is behaving well, don't go overboard on the reward, because your dog can sense your happiness. When you dog is not behaving well, don't punish your Dobie horribly. It knows you're unhappy. Don't be scarce on discipline. Dobies should respond well to a firm \"no\". The scold should be directed at him/her, so at the dog and point at them. Dobermans don't respond well to physical punishments, and hitting or physically punishing your dog is animal abuse.  Do not deliberately stare a dog in the eye, especially if they may be aggressive. This is considered hostile, and you may inadvertently be challenging the dog to a fight. The key to training is teaching your dog through repetition. Tell your dog what you want it to do and never give it any mixed signals. This can be harder than you would think, so pay attention to your actions as much as your dogs."

      "Drain the shucked oysters and reserve the liquid. Use a sharp kitchen knife to rough chop the oysters into smaller pieces.  Use a container of pre-shucked oysters for this recipe instead of fresh oysters. The actual oysters will be filtered out of the sauce later, so you do not need to worry about cutting them into precise sizes. Making them smaller can help release the flavor faster, though, which is why chopping the oysters beforehand is generally a good idea. Place the chopped oysters in a small saucepan with the reserved oyster juice and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it on high until the liquid reaches a steady, rolling boil. Stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally to prevent the oysters from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, allowing the liquid to drop to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Keep an eye on the saucepan during this time. You do not need to stir the mixture inside, but you should make sure that the liquid remains at a steady simmer. Adjust the heat settings as necessary. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Sprinkle in 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of salt and stir well to combine. Pour the contents of the saucepan through a sieve or strainer. Save the liquid and discard the solid ingredients.  If you want to save the cooked oysters, you can do so by transferring them to a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid. Place the container in the refrigerator and store the oysters for up to four days. Pour the liquid portion of the mixture back into your saucepan after filtering out the solids. Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) light soy sauce to the mixture and stir well. Pour 1/2 to 1 Tbsp (7.5 to 15 ml) dark soy sauce into the mixture and stir it in, as well.  Using both light and dark soy sauces will give the taste of the oyster sauce more depth, but if you only have one type of soy sauce on hand, simply use a full 2-1/2 to 5 Tbsp (37.5 to 75 ml) of that soy sauce, instead. If you aren't sure about how much soy sauce to add, start by adding a smaller portion. Taste test the results and add more soy sauce if you want a stronger flavor. Return the saucepan to the stove and heat it on high until the liquid reaches a rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Keep the lid off the pan this time. The oyster sauce should thicken as some of the liquid simmers away, but the thickening process will be hindered if you keep the lid on. Let the oyster sauce cool for a few minutes before you use it. If you want to save the sauce for later, pour it into a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid and refrigerate it for up to one week.",
      "Collect 4 tsp (20 ml) of canning juice from a can of shucked oysters. Pour this liquid into a small bowl. You will not need to use the oysters for this recipe. You can discard them or use them for another recipe. Transfer the oysters to a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid and refrigerate for up to one or two weeks. Pour 8 tsp (40 ml) of soy sauce into the bowl of oyster juices. Use a whisk to thoroughly mix the liquids together.  You could use light or dark soy sauce, or a combination of the two. Alternatively, if you do not have any soy sauce, you could use teriyaki. Sprinkle 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar into the liquid and whisk rapidly until the sugar is fully dissolved. Taste the oyster sauce. If necessary, add another 1 tsp (5 ml) of oyster juice and/or another 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar. Mix well. You can add more soy sauce, as well, but do so carefully to avoid making the mixture too salty. Neither the saltiness of the soy sauce nor the sweetness of the sugar should be too overpowering. The oyster sauce can be used immediately, but if you want to save it for another time, pour it into an airtight plastic or glass container and refrigerate for up to one week.",
      "Place the mushrooms and flax seeds in separate bowls. Pour water over the contents of both dishes and allow them to absorb that water for a full four hours.  Place the mushrooms in a dish and pour enough cool water inside to cover them by a full 1 inch (2.5 cm). Soak for four hours, drain the water, then rinse with running water. Cut the mushrooms into strips and set aside. Place the flax seeds in a small bowl and pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water over them. Let soak for four hours. The flax seeds should absorb the water during this time. Pour the vegetable oil into a medium saucepan or deep skillet. Warm the oil on the stove over medium-high heat. Scatter the sliced ginger in the hot oil. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the ginger turns golden-brown. Remove the ginger from the oil when ready. Set it aside temporarily. Toss in the prepared mushrooms and drizzle in the sesame oil. Reduce the heat to medium, and stir-fry for several minutes until the sesame oil becomes fragrant. You should only need to cook these ingredients for a minute or so before the heat draws out the scent of the sesame oil. Stir-fry the contents of the pan for 30 to 60 seconds, blending the seasonings in thoroughly. If you do not have both light and dark soy sauces, use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of whatever soy sauce you have on hand. Pour the water and sugar into the pan and stir them into the rest of the contents. Cover, and let simmer for a full 10 minutes. Watch the contents of the pan. You do not need to stir the mixture, but you need to make sure that it remains at a gentle simmer for the full 10 minutes. Adjust the heat settings as needed to maintain that simmer. Remove the pan from the stove and transfer the mixture inside to a large bowl. Allow it to drop to room temperature. Pour the cooled mixture into a blender. Add the flax seeds, as well as the pre-cooked ginger, and pulse the ingredients together until texture becomes smooth. You won't be filtering out any solid ingredients for this recipe, so any visible chunks left behind need to be very small and hardly noticeable. Pour the pureed sauce into a saucepan and return it to the stove. Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat for roughly 5 minutes. Essentially, you're just heating the sauce through during this step. You don't want it to boil or simmer. You can serve the vegan oyster sauce now or pour it into a plastic or glass container with an airtight lid. Refrigerate it for up to one week."

      "In Italy, it’s normal to go to lunch around 1:00 in the afternoon and dinner around 8:00 in the evening. If you’re wanting to truly blend into the culture, don’t arrive at the restaurant any earlier than these times. Keep in mind that most Italian restaurants close between lunch and dinner. If you order every single course option, you’ll likely have way too much food to eat. It is completely normal in Italy to choose 2 or so different courses to order and to pass on the rest. Keep in mind that the portions for each course are smaller than in the United States. In Italian culture, it’s seen as rude to drop off the check when it isn’t asked for. Make sure to ask for the check when you want it. In Italy, it’s appropriate to subtly raise a hand, make eye contact with your server, and say, “Il conte per favore.” This means, “The check, please.” In Italy, tipping the server is unnecessary and gratuity will never be added to your bill. In most instances, you’ll stand out as a foreigner If you tip the server. However, if you’re at a nice restaurant and you feel like you’ve been treated extremely well, consider tipping 10%. It’s socially acceptable and recommended that you tip 18-20% at restaurants in the United States, whether or not they’re Italian.",
      "At meals, it’s most common to order water and/or wine to drink. Most Italian restaurants have both flat and sparkling bottled water, but not tap water. They’ll probably have red, white, and sparkling wines available for you to choose from. When eating at a restaurant in Italy, the server will likely ask you, “Da bere?” which means “To drink?” Answer with something like, “un litro di aqua naturale,” which means “a liter of flat water. ” In Italian, “antipasta” means “before the meal.” This is similar to an appetizer and often includes cured meats, cured cheeses, fried vegetables, olives, or toasted bread with tomatoes (“bruschetta”). Order antipasti before any other courses. Once you’ve decided on an appetizer at a restaurant in Italy, the server may ask, “Che facciamo?” meaning, “What are we making?” Respond with something like, “Per antipasto facciamo un carpaccio.” This means, “For an appetizer, let’s make a carpaccio.” Next, choose a pasta, risotto, or soup from the “Primo” section of the menu. There will likely be many different pasta dishes to choose from that come in a variety of shapes and are served with a variety of sauces. In Italy, the server may say, “Per primo?” meaning “For your first course?” to which you can reply something like, “Per primo facciamo spaghetti alla carbonara.” After pasta, you’ll most likely order red meat, poultry, or fish as the second course. The second course typically doesn’t come with any sides. Choose a meat from the “Secondo” section of the menu. If eating in Italy, your server may ask, “Per secondo?” which means “For the second course?” You may say something like, “Per secondo facciamo, una bistecca alla fiorentina.” ” Following the second course, you’ll be served a side dish of your choice, often served with a salad. At this point, order vegetables, potatoes, or any other side listed on the menu. A server in a restaurant in Italy may get your side dish course by asking, “Salata, contorno?” which means, “Salad, side dish?” In response, say “Si grazie, un insalata e patatine fritte.” This means, “Yes please, a salad and french fries.” ” You’ll probably be offered dessert at this point in your meal. This is often a fruit selection, but tiramisu and/or other sweet treats may also be on the menu. Make your selection and tell the server what you want. If you’re in Italy, the server will likely say, “Poi un dolche?” to which you can reply, “Si, un tiramisù.” If you want coffee after your meal, there are a few different ways you can have it prepared for you. Either order a “normale,” which is an espresso shot, or a “macchiato,” which means coffee with a drop of milk. You can also order a “lungo,” meaning “long” coffee, which is similar to a normale but is brewed with twice as much water, making it bigger and more diluted than an espresso shot. “Digestivi” is a beverage that typically contains liquor and fruit juice. Order and drink it after your last course if you want to do like the Italians do and settle your stomach.",
      "Many make the mistake of pronouncing bruschetta like “brewshhetta.” However, “ch” in Italian sounds like a hard “k.” If you’re ordering bruschetta as your antipasto, remember to enunciate that hard “k.” ” Sometimes people think that gnocchi is pronounced like “nookie.” While it’s true that the “g” is silent, this isn’t quite right. Say “nyoh-kee” if you decide to order these potato dumplings as your primo. Instead of saying “minestron-ee,” pronounce this word with a softer emphasis on the last “e.” There are no silent vowels on the end of Italian words, but this doesn’t mean that they’re harsh-sounding. While the spelling of this Italian pizza is the same as an alcoholic beverage you may be familiar with, their pronunciations are a little different. Don’t include the “r” in the second syllable if you choose to order a margarita pizza. As a good rule of thumb, it’s best to pronounce every syllable of each Italian word if you have no idea how to say it. This will increase your chances of saying it correctly and/or being understood."

      "Before you can even start writing your letter, you need to decide what stationery to use. Notebook paper is always a safe option, but it’s not the only one. If you recently went on a trip with your family, use a postcard from that location. Or if you have special stationary that you really love, use that instead. To do this, write your note on a 6” by 6” piece of paper (or any square-shaped paper). Fold the paper twice over so your paper is divided into four equal quadrants. Fold the top point down to meet the crease in the center. Fold the bottom point up so it touches the top point. Fold your right side to meet the crease in the center and then do the same with the left side. Flip the heart over and fold the top points down. If you’re passing your note in an envelope, feel free to gussy up the envelope as well. You can add stickers or use stencils to write your crush’s name out. If you want to be funny, try cutting out your crush’s name using letters from a magazine and taping them to the envelope so it looks like a ransom note.  Keep in mind that he might not like stickers as much as you do. Less is usually more when it comes to decorating your note, unless you want the note to look over-the-top on purpose. If the note is serious in tone, it's probably best to keep it simple: just write his name in plain letters on the envelope. To make your envelope a little more colorful and fun, try painting it. To do this, all you will need is your envelope, some paint and a brush. Try painting wavy lines in different colored stripes.  When painting, make sure to keep your brush flat and drag it across the surface. Let the envelope dry before you put your letter inside.",
      "If you really like this boy, tell him that. Figure out what you want this note to achieve. Do you want him to give you his number so you can text him? Ask for his number in your note. Do you want to hang out with him after school? Ask him to come over to your house to watch a movie. Figure out what you want to achieve with your note and writing it will become so much easier.  Be honest with yourself as well. Don't tell him it's okay if he doesn't like you, you're okay with just being friends if that's not true. Make sure whatever you put in your note is truthful, otherwise you're starting off on the wrong foot. It’s also okay to say you don’t know what to say. Telling him “I don’t know how to tell you this, but I really like you” is very endearing and he’ll be flattered that you were even brave enough to try. There’s no right way to tell someone you like them, so you can feel free to be as creative as you want. Try writing a poem to let him know how you feel.  Your poem doesn’t have to rhyme if you don’t want it to. There are many different types and lengths of poems, so fool around and see which one feels right for you. If all else fails, go back to the classics. You can’t go wrong with a little “Roses are red, violets are blue, this poem is stupid, but I still like you.” If you have trouble putting what you feel into your own words, use somebody else’s. Include a quote from your favorite movie or book or add a song lyric that makes you think of him. It doesn’t matter what you say, as long as he gets the idea that you like him. Use your note to express things you might be embarrassed to say in person. Compliment his hair or his clothes or his personality; whatever it is that makes him attractive to you, tell him. Even if he decides that he’s not interested in you, he’ll still appreciate the compliments. If you and your crush are already friends, chances are you have at least one inside joke. Include that joke in your note; these details are unique and specific to your relationship and he’ll appreciate that you thought to include it. Your love letter doesn’t just have to be a letter. If you feel self-conscious explaining yourself in words, try explaining yourself in song. Make your crush a mixed CD or playlist of all the songs that make you think of him. If you’re artistic, draw him a picture of you and him together.  Whatever you decide to give him, make sure you include some kind of note with your name on it. You wouldn’t want to give him a gift and make him guess where it’s coming from. The note with your gift doesn’t have to be highly detailed. It can be as simple as To Jack, From Jill. The gift is what you’re explaining yourself with, so the note accompanying it can be very low-key.",
      "If you frequently pass your crush in the halls, plan on giving him the note during that time. You won’t have too much time before you have to get to your next class, so you won’t have to worry about standing around and talking awkwardly.  If you’re too nervous or anxious to pass the note yourself, give it to a friend to pass on. Make sure you choose a friend that you trust, just in case they decide to read the note themselves and tell others what it says. You could also give him the note in class. He’ll probably be thrilled to have something to do (other than focusing on the lesson and studying, of course). Just make sure it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.

If you don’t want to give the note directly to your crush and you feel weird asking someone else to do it, slide the note through the slots in his locker.

Some people believe that e-mail is not romantic, but that’s actually not the case. As long as you’re being honest and sharing your feelings, your crush won’t really care how you send them over. You can also send your note as a text or Facebook message. Whatever medium you feel most comfortable using, do that. If you’re absolutely convinced that you couldn’t possibly send your crush a letter with your name on it, try leaving your name off. Your crush won’t know who his secret admirer is, but some people like a mystery. Just know that if you want to actually pursue a relationship with your crush, you’re going to have to come clean about it eventually."

      "to show confidence. By practicing the physical act of appearing confident, you will actually start to feel more confident. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, hold your chin up, relax your shoulders, and breathe deeply. This will naturally make you seem more attractive to anyone who's around you. The more you practice good posture, the more natural it will feel. Speaking slowly gives other people the impression that you're confident and knowledgeable. You will also seem more authoritative if you slightly lower your vocal range as you speak.  When you're telling a story, think about each sentence and how it relates to what you're saying. Don't be afraid to leave a pause between sentences while you're speaking. It seems more confident than using filler words like \"um\" or \"like.\" People who are more physically engaged while they're speaking seem more confident than those who do not.  Gesture with your hands to emphasize strong points. Think about how to use your body to convey a message. For instance, you could lean forward and rest your hand on your chin when you're interested in what someone else is saying. No matter what you look like, you'll be the most attractive when you're happy with how you look. Wear clothes that make you feel comfortable. If you wear makeup, play up the features that you like the most. Alpha males are attracted to confidence, and wearing too much makeup can make you seem insecure. Keep your makeup natural-looking on most of your face. If you do go bold, emphasize one feature of your face at a time.  For instance, if you wear a bold red lip, opt for a subtle smoky eye and subtle eyeliner. If you go for a dramatic winged liner and dark eyeshadow, try pairing it with a nude lip and a little blush. Smelling good can make you seem more attractive. A little goes a long way, though. Spritz a little of the fragrance on your wrists, then touch your wrists to your neck to transfer the scent.",
      "Keep your alpha man interested by having your own interests and goals outside of him. You’ll both have more to talk about at the end of the day if you’re busy pursuing your own career or hobbies. If anyone tries to keep you from pursuing your own interests, remove yourself from the situation and find someone who will appreciate your independence. Most alpha males need time every so often to hang out with their friends or to pursue their hobbies. Show him that you appreciate who he is by encouraging him to do these things.  If he loves to fish, ask him if he'd like to take the weekend to go on a fishing trip while you visit your family. If you know his friends have a poker night on Thursdays, consider taking a class on Thursday nights. That way, he can still enjoy his time with his friends, and you won't be sitting at home waiting for him. An alpha male can run the risk of feeling like he’s alone at the top of the pack. Let him know it’s you and him against the world by offering a supportive shoulder whenever he’s feeling stressed.  If you know he’s had a long day, call and order his favorite take-out and make some time for just the two of you. Try saying something like, “I know you had a big meeting today. How did it go?” A lot of alpha males are used to strutting through life without ever being challenged. If you feel like he’s wrong, let him know. He might be surprised at first but he’ll respect you more in the long run.  Try not to challenge him in front of other people. No one likes to feel embarrassed, especially alpha males. Wait until the two of you are alone to talk about something you didn’t like. You might say something like, “I know you were annoyed that the food took a long time to come out, but I didn’t like that you were rude to our waiter.” When you're ready to take your relationship to the next level, don't assume that he will automatically know. Specifically tell him that you like him and you're interested in being exclusive with each other.  If he agrees to a committed relationship, set aside some time to celebrate! If he seems reluctant to commit to you, say something like, \"I'm sorry you made that decision. I hope you find what you're looking for,\" then move on with your life. You deserve someone who will give you their undivided attention.",
      "Alpha males are defined primarily by their dominant characteristics. If he’s really an alpha, he’ll want to feel like he’s in control of the chase. If you catch his eye at a party or in a club, smile at him to let him know you’re interested, but let him be the one to come to you.  If he asks for your phone number, don't ask him for his. That way he'll have to be the one to call or text first. If the two of you are hanging out and having a good time, let him ask you out for a second date. Every situation is different, so if you think he's interested but he doesn't ask you out, go ahead and ask him out instead. If you want to attract a top-tier mate, you need to know your worth. By valuing yourself, you’ll show him that he should value you too.  Show him that you're confident by accepting compliments without deflecting them and talking about your accomplishments. Just as you know your strengths, you should also be humble about your weaknesses. You don’t have to tell him what they are, but don’t act like you’re too good for him. Make him feel like he’s number one by telling him all the things you like about him. Building up his ego will make him want to have you around. Try saying something like, “I love how you’re always working to better yourself,” or “It’s so much fun to watch you work the room at a party.” Appeal to his inner provider by making him feel like you need him. Ask him to help you with small things that you have a hard time with or don’t enjoy doing, like opening a jar that’s stuck or calling to make reservations at a restaurant. There’s no need to pretend you’re weak to attract your alpha male. You can be strong and confident while still needing him. Think of things that play to his strengths, then ask for his help. Alpha males like to make decisions, but that doesn't mean they'll always want to be the one with a plan. Let him know a few things you'd like to do, then sit back and enjoy as he makes it happen.  For instance, if there's a movie you really want to see, let him know you'd be interested in going to the movies for a date. Spontaneous dates can keep things fresh. If the weather's nice, ask him if he'd like to eat lunch in a nearby park. Most alpha males enjoy regularly trying something they've never done before, just to keep life interesting and challenging. Take a day trip to a nearby museum neither of you have ever visited, try out a new restaurant, or hike to a hidden waterfall just outside of town."

      "Especially if the item came from a secondhand store or a friend, regardless of the fiber content of the item, you should make sure there are no signs that the item is infested. It is possible that stray caterpillars could be attached to the clothing and end up hatching in your closet. In the United States, most infestations come from webbing clothes moths, but you should still inspect for both.  Look for patches of silk webbing and feeding tube which webbing clothes moths leave behind. Casemaking moths' cases will change to match the color of the clothing they're eating. For this reason, you should always look for numerous, suspicious small holes as this your best warning sign for an infestation. Frequently clean your closet from top to bottom; moths like to live in places where it's dark and they're undisturbed. Move things around: move your clothes out, wipe things down with detergent-soaked clothes, and vacuum the floors and drawers. You might think that your clothes, particularly those made out of cotton and manmade fibers, will be okay as long as your wool is stored separately. But moths like to eat the tiny detritus left behind from human skin, like sweat, as well as food particles. Make sure your clothes have always been washed before they return to your closet space. You can use vacuum sealing, ziplock bags, or even plastic containers with airtight lids to store your wool garments when you're not using them. This is particularly helpful in the spring and summer months. You can also line these spaces with anti-moth paper, cedar, or even mothballs to make them extra secure. Most if not all of these items should be available from Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, Target, or Walmart.  Be careful: storing clothes in an airtight container can only keep new infestations from happening; if your clothing already has eggs on it, they'll hatch and eat the clothes anyway. Be sure you've properly cleaned your clothing first. Make sure the containers are also dry, as are your clothes, to prevent mold. The strong smell of cedar helps to camouflage your clothes from moths. You can invest in cedar furniture to store clothing, but if that's too expensive, cedarwood hangers, cedarwood blocks, and even oil diffusers that use cedarwood's aromatic oils are affordable solutions. JCPenney, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Amazon will all carry them.  There has been some limited evidence suggesting that Eastern Red Cedar (actually a juniper) contains an aromatic oil that, over time and with a sufficient enough concentration, will kill small moth larvae. However, a closet would provide too much air circulation to be lethal to larvae, and would probably only serve as a deterrent for the adult moths. Eastern Red cedar is only effective for a few years. After a while, the aromatic oil contained within the wood will evaporate, rendering it ineffective in a fight against moths. It's long been thought that certain herbs and food products could protect your clothes from moths. The theory is that, for the same reason that cedar is effective (a very powerful odor), moths can be similarly kept at bay by other strong odors. In a recent experiment, researchers found that cinnamon, cloves, and lavender were all effective at keep moths from eating clothing. You can make sachets or put out a bowl of scented oil in your closet.  Some aromatic herbs, like bay leaves, eucalyptus, lemon peel, and mint proved to be ineffective in the experiment, so be careful about which herbs you use. Beware that some of these scents are very difficult to get out of clothing, in case you or loved ones dislike or have any allergies to these plants. Whether you're trying to prevent an infestation from occurring for the first time, or trying to prevent one from recurring, you should check your clothing throughout the year. Look for signs of an infestation, which generally amount to suspicious and multiple holes in your clothing.  Although this is particularly important during the months your clothes are not stored in plastic containers, it's also important to check at least once after you've stored them: adults live for about 75 to 80 days, and eggs hatch into larvae after 4-10 days. If moth eggs managed to make their way into the storage item and go unchecked, you may come back to ruined clothing months too late.  Moving and shuffling your clothes around during this process is actually very helpful because moths do not like to lay their eggs in places that are frequently disturbed.",
      "You first step is to figure out where your moth infestation originated. Look for holes in any garments made out of animal fibers to try to find out where the moths have been leaving their eggs, since it's the larvae that feed on them after they hatch. Commonly what will happen is that someone buys a piece of secondhand clothing that's already been infested, thus transferring the infestation to their own closet. Depending on the source's financial and sentimental value as well as the extent of the infestation, you may either decide to have the item cleaned and repaired, or it may be more cost effective and safe for the rest of your wardrobe to simply dispose of the infested items. For items that are made of wool or animal products, this means taking them to the dry cleaner's. Let the workers know that you want the clothes cleaned specifically for moths so that they'll use chemicals that will kill moth eggs. Everything else needs to go into the wash with hot water, preferably around 120° Fahrenheit (roughly 49° Celsius), to be sure that any stray caterpillars are destroyed. Finish this process off by drying them in the sunlight, which is known to kill larvae. After you've found the source and gotten your clothes cleaning underway, you need to clean your closet. Moths' eggs can end up in a whole host of places: your floor, the tops and bottoms of shelves, and even the ceiling. Do a thorough job of vacuuming and dusting, especially in the corners and any carpeted areas.  Moth eggs can hide in carpet and under furniture, so it's very important that you thoroughly vacuum everywhere.  Although you do not need to use a special spray for solid, wood surfaces where dusting is easy, there are special sprays that you can buy to use on your clothing and carpet to repel and kill moths. ContainerStore.com, GreenFibres.com, Lakeland.co.uk, and RoullierWhite.com all sell sprays ranging from $7.50 to $18.60 per bottle. These traps lure male moths to powder that contains the pheromones of female moths. This powder sticks to their wings and gives the male moths the false appearance of female moths. With both male and female moths confused as to who to breed with, the breeding cycle can be effectively ended. Mothballs are an effective way to kill moths. They contain naphthalene, which is made from crude oil or coal tar, and turns from a solid to a toxic gas. When it's inhaled, it reacts with cells, breaking them down and damaging tissue.  Items like coats that have pockets can be protected by putting mothballs in the pockets. Be careful: using mothballs around small children and pets is potentially very dangerous, especially if ingested.  Clothing that has been stored with mothballs should be washed afterward to prevent anemia (when blood doesn't carry oxygen through the body) caused by naphthalene vapors. If you develop a headache, nausea, dizziness, or vomiting after being exposed to mothballs, discontinue using and dispose of the mothballs. High temperatures will kill moth eggs and larvae. So using an iron, which applies direct, high heat to your clothing, will kill moth eggs and larvae clinging to your clothes. It is perfectly safe to iron your wool clothing unless the garment's tags say 'do not iron' or 'dry clean only.' If the clothing item can be ironed, set your iron to the 'wool' setting, use a steam heat, and press from the inside with a pressing cloth between the iron and your clothes. Sub-zero temperatures will kill any larvae or moths in any of their developing stages. If you live in a place that gets cold enough, you can leave your items outside for the day. Otherwise, you can pack them into the freezer for a few days without needing to pack them into plastic bags.  Make sure if you've washed your clothes first that they are completely dry before freezing them or else you risk moisture turning into ice crystals on the cloth. Some sources indicate to freeze your clothes in plastic bags for a week to be sure any pests are completely dead. If all other efforts to rid your closet of a moth infestation fail, you can always turn to a professional pest control service for help. There are usually 24-hour emergency call out services available that you can use to book a last-minute appointment. While this method will most likely be the priciest, it will also probably be the most thorough.  Reach out to a local fumigator by looking up pest control in your phonebook or doing an online search using keywords like \"pest control near me.\" Try finding a number of services to compare pricing, and look to websites like Yelp or Angie's List for customer reviews. Be aware that if you choose to go with fumigation, they will most likely be using commercial pesticides. You and any children or pets you have may need to avoid any areas that have been fumigated for a day or more."

      "Direct sunlight enables more rapid algae growth. Help minimize algae proliferation by keeping your fountain in a shady or covered area.  If a completely shaded area is not available, a partially shaded area may still help slow algae growth. Also consider placing a cover such as an umbrella or awning in the area near your fountain to help provide shade if no natural shade is available. Once you’ve put your fountain where you want it, fill it with clean tap water, from a garden hose, for example. Then, connect your fountain to a power source by plugging it into an electrical outlet. You can also opt for chlorinated water instead, as it will act as a disinfectant and prevent unwanted biological growth. The best time to start using algae prevention products is right after you have set up or deep cleaned your fountain. Commercial products are available online as well as at home improvement and maintenance stores.   If you are concerned about the health and safety of wildlife using your fountain, look for animal-safe products. Most products found in pet stores and hardware stores will be animal-safe, but it is important to check the labels. Common products include Algae Shield and SeaKlear. If wildlife is not a concern, such as with indoor fountains, a cap of bleach may also work as a preventative measure. Before applying an anti-algae agent to your fountain, check the manufacturer's instructions to make sure that the product you purchased will not damage your current fountain setup. Product instructions will vary by product, but often all you need to do is add the product to the water on a regular basis to the running fountain.",
      "If you find that your fountain has developed noticeable algae, the first thing you need to do is thoroughly scrub the individual components of your fountain. Take your fountain apart and clean each surface using soap and hot water and allow to air dry before reassembling. Wipe down the fountain with distilled white vinegar or a solution of 1 cup of bleach per gallon of water before soaping and rinsing the fountain. Rinse bleach thoroughly. Unlike preventative treatments, algaecides are meant to kill off existing algae growths within a fountain. Algaecides are available in home improvement stores as well as online and specialty retailers.  Check the algaecide bottle to see how to properly use the product. Check the bottle to see how much product should be added to the water and at what frequency. Non-metallic algaecides work better in fountains as they are less likely to stain. If heavy algae growth continues for extended periods in your fountain, consider replacing the pump to get better water movement and circulation. You may be able to do this yourself, or you may want to call in an expert depending on the size of your fountain and your level of experience. Fountain pump systems can differ greatly. Check with your manufacturer to see what components your fountain requires.",
      "Changing the water helps eliminate current living algae and prevents buildup in your fountain’s pump system. Completely empty your fountain of cold water and allow it air dry before filling the fountain. If possible, rinse down your fountain and wipe away any buildup or residue from the fountain surface as well as any decorative features such as stones before refilling it. The pump is responsible for cycling water through the fountain, reducing algae's ability to grow. Scrub the pump's parts with a sponge or a firm-bristled toothbrush and distilled water. If you need to open the pump in order to get at interior parts, follow the manufacturer's instructions. All pumps are different, and what works for one pump may not work for another. The pump cannot function unless it is entirely underwater. Keep the pump submerged to keep water cycling through and prevent algae from building and growing on the surface. It is common to have to add water to your fountain for the first several days after setting it up in order to ensure the pump stays submerged. Your fountain should receive a deep cleaning every two months. Turn off and drain the fountain and wipe it down with a fountain cleaning solution, which may be available from a specialty retailer or online, or dish soap.  Opt for dish soap if you are looking for a product that is friendly to animals such as birds and small mammals that may make use of your fountain. Go over the fountain with a toothbrush to scrape off algae and other organic matter. Be sure to thoroughly rinse the fountain after using soap, as it may damage the fountain if left on its surface. Clean the fountain's tubes using pipe cleaners, such as can be found at any hardware or craft store, to scrub out the pipe interiors."

      "This is where the footing, or foundation, of your column will be. It's important that you build the footing down into the ground as opposed to on the surface so that your column is stable. The depth and dimensions of the hole will depend on several factors, like the size of your column, how much weight it will support, and the kind of ground you're building on. If you're not sure, do some research online or consult with a professional mason.  As a rule of thumb, the hole should be at least 12 inches (30 cm) deep. Make sure the hole is at least 4 inches (10 cm) longer and wider than your column will be so you have enough room to build the footing. Verify that the bottom of the hole you dug is level before you proceed. If it's not level, your brick column won't be either, so you'll want to level it first. Cut a wooden plank or stud into 4 pieces—1 piece for each side of the frame—and nail them together to make a square frame. Then, place the frame in the hole you dug so it's laying flat on the bottom of the hole. Since you'll be using the empty inside of the frame to make your footing, make sure the frame is 4 inches (10 cm) longer and wider than your column will be when measured from the inside edges of the wood and not the outside edges. For example, if you want to build a concrete column that's 24 by 24 inches (61 cm × 61 cm), you'd want to make a frame that's 28 by 28 inches (71 cm × 71 cm) when measured from the inside edges of the frame. and let it dry completely. Once you've poured the concrete, take a piece of wood and drag it across the surface of the frame to scrape off any excess concrete and smooth out the surface so it's level for your column. Then, wait for the concrete to dry.  How long it takes for the concrete to dry will depend on the type of concrete you use. Some concrete can take weeks to fully cure, while others are designed to dry in a few hours. If you want to speed up your project, try using a fast-setting concrete mix so you can pour the concrete and start working on your column all on the same day.  Alternatively if the column isn't load-bearing or very tall, you can later bricks and more in an area 18 inches (46 cm) deep and 4 inches (10 cm) wider than the column. Dry-laying your bricks is just arranging them on the footing in the pattern you'll be using without actually securing them to the footing with mortar. Simply take all the bricks you'll use for the first course (the first layer of your column) and lay them on top of the footing so the ends are touching and they form a square or rectangle. Don't put a brick in the center of the course since the center of your brick column will be hollow. Also, leave a 3⁄8 inch (0.95 cm) space between each neighboring brick so you can connect them with mortar later on.  When the bricks are centered on the footing, there should be 4 inches (10 cm) of footing extending off of each side. Use a pencil to trace all around the outer edge of the course and then along the inner edge of the course so you're left with 2 rectangles or squares, 1 inside of the other. This will give you an outline to use when you spread the first layer of mortar on the footing. When you reach a gap between the bricks, just draw a straight line across the gap to the next brick as if the gap wasn't there.",
      "Use a trowel to apply the mortar to the footing, and try to stay inside the reference lines as much as possible. However, it's OK if you go outside of the lines a little bit—you can always scrape the mortar off later before it dries. Don't apply any mortar to the center of the footing, which is outside of the outline you drew. You only want to apply mortar where you'll be laying bricks. The center of the footing is where the inside of your column will be, which will be hollow. Take the same bricks you used to dry-lay and mark the footing and set them on the mortar in the same pattern you did before. Before you lay each brick, spread a 3⁄8 inch (0.95 cm) layer of mortar on the end that will be joined with the next brick in the pattern. When you're finished, all of the bricks should be connected with mortar and evenly spaced apart.  You want to make sure that you're applying an even layer of mortar to each brick so that your column has a uniform, balanced appearance when it's finished. Make a weep hole in the base layer of bricks by coating a pencil with vegetable oil and inserting it into one of the bottom mortar joints. Pull the pencil out once the mortar is dry. This helps drain any moisture that may accumulate inside your column. First, spread a 3⁄8 inch (0.95 cm) layer of mortar on top of the first course of bricks using the trowel. Then, take the same number of bricks as you used for the first course and place them on the mortar in the same pattern, just rotated 180 degrees. This will give your brick column the alternating pattern that is typically used in brick structures. For example, if you're staring down at your first course of bricks and there are 2 horizontal bricks on top, 1 vertical brick on each side, and 1 horizontal brick on the bottom, you would lay the second course of bricks so there are 2 horizontal bricks on the bottom, 1 vertical brick on each side, and 1 horizontal brick on top. The number of courses you add depends on how tall you want your brick column to be. Just remember to always rotate the pattern 180 degrees after each course of bricks you lay. Make sure you maintain a consistent thickness with the mortar you apply between courses and bricks. If the bricks aren't level, you want to catch it early on so you don't compound the issue and realize your column is off once the mortar is already dry. To check if the column is level, hold a level against each side, including the top. If something isn't level, tap or push the bricks into the right position with the butt end of your trowel and then check them with the level again.  Run strings in each corner of your column from the bottom to the top and make sure they're straight with a level. This way you can make sure your bricks are straight and level as you build them up. Don't add another course until you're certain all of the existing bricks are level. Wire mesh will add extra support that can help your brick column withstand heavier loads. To add the mesh, cut a strip that's as long and wide as the column. Then, apply a thin layer of mortar over the top course of bricks and lay the mesh over it. Finally, apply another thin layer of mortar over the top of the mesh before adding the next course. You can find wire mesh online or at your local hardware store. When you finish laying every fifth course, test all of the mortar joints on the column by pressing your finger into them. If any of the joints resist minimal pressure, they're hard enough to be smoothed out. Just take a jointing tool and go over those joints with it to scrape off the excess mortar. When you're finished, the joints should appear flush with the bricks.  Make sure you do this after every fifth course. Otherwise, some of the joints could harden too much, and you might not be able to smooth them out. Use a masonry brush to clean your bricks as you build up so they look neater.",
      "Apply the mesh as you did throughout the rest of the column. Just spread a thin layer of mortar over the top course, put down the mesh, and top it with another thin layer of mortar. Don't skip this step. You'll need the wire mesh to help support the final course of bricks, which will have an extra brick in it. Since this will be the top of your brick column, you want to cover the hole in the center so it's not visible. To add the center brick, wait until you've put down the first 2 bricks in the final course. Then, lay the center brick and finish the rest of the course. If there are any joints you haven't smoothed out yet, wait until they harden to the point where they resist minimal pressure. Then, use your jointing tool to scrape off the excess mortar so they're flush with the bricks. Be careful you don't wait too long or the mortar could dry and you'll lose your chance to smooth out the joints. A capstone can be brick, concrete or stone, and it's put on top of a brick column to give it a nice, finished appearance. If you're interested in adding a capstone to your column, get one that's around 3 inches (7.6 cm) longer and wider than the column. Then, spread a layer of mortar on top of the column and center the capstone on top of it.  You can also make a brick capstone by using bricks that are larger than the ones you used in your column. Cut your bricks in half and lay them with their sides facing out for added strength and visual appeal."

      "Rewards can be a powerful motivator! Whenever you accomplish a goal—even a little one—take a moment to reward yourself. Your rewards don’t have to be anything elaborate or fancy. It could be something as simple as watching a funny 5-minute video after completing a short reading assignment. Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger accomplishments. For example, you might go out for pizza with a friend after handing in an important paper. You don’t have to save all the rewards for when you’re done working. Sometimes it can help to give your mood a lift before you get down to a task. Take a few minutes to enjoy a favorite snack or check your social media. Just make sure you limit yourself to a specific amount of time (like 10 minutes, for example) so that you don’t end up getting totally distracted and wasting a few hours. Working with a friend can make homework more enjoyable. You and your buddy can also help keep each other on track. Make sure you choose a friend who is serious about getting their work done so that you don’t end up goofing off and distracting each other.  Doing homework with a friend doesn’t necessarily mean collaborating on the same assignments. You can just spend time together while you each do your own work. Check with your teacher first before working together with a friend on an assignment. They may want you to do the work by yourself. Some people work best when they first get up in the morning, whereas others feel more energized in the late afternoon or evening. You might also find that some study environments work better for you than others. Experiment to figure out what works best for you.  For example, if you’re a morning person, try doing your homework right after you eat breakfast. If you tend to get distracted while working at your desk at home, experiment with doing your homework in the library or a coffee shop instead. Some people also find it helpful to change their routine from time to time. If you find yourself getting bored, try working at a different time from usual or finding a new study space. Setting specific goals can help you stay motivated and make your work feel more manageable. To get the most from your goals, make them Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART). Write down your goals and be sure to celebrate whenever you achieve one, no matter how small! Setting vague goals can lead to frustration. Instead of saying, “I’m going to get all my homework done this week,” try something more specific—e.g., “I’m going to work on my English essay for 1 hour every day this week.” Even if you’re not that excited about the classes you’re taking right now, looking at the big picture and setting some personal goals for yourself can help. Think about the ways that doing well in school will help you in the long run.  For example, maybe you want to get good grades so you can get into your dream college, or possibly you’re working towards an exciting career. Doing a good job in your classes can also be its own reward—knowing that you worked hard and did your best is a great self-esteem booster!",
      "It’s hard to concentrate on homework if you’re tired, hungry, or uncomfortable. Try to get plenty of sleep if you know you’ll have to do a bunch of homework the next day, and don’t try to work on an empty stomach or with a full bladder!  If you feel physically tense, do some yoga or light stretches before you begin to work. Doing breathing exercises can also help you feel more comfortable and alert. If you’re not already in comfy clothes, get changed before you start working. This may mean joggers, sweatpants, pjs, shorts, underwear, or even being completely naked. It's your choice. Your environment can make a big difference in how well you focus on your work. Before you begin doing your homework, find a spot that is quiet, well-lit, and gives you plenty of space to spread out.  You’ll want a place where you can sit comfortably, but don’t get too comfortable. If you do homework in bed or on a cozy couch, you may be tempted to fall asleep! If you have to work at home, ask anyone who lives with you to give you a little quiet time while you do your homework. If you’re constantly looking at your Facebook feed or checking your Instagram notifications, you won’t get much work done. Put your phone in a place where you can’t get at it easily, like inside your bag or in a desk drawer. Turn off notifications if they distract you.  If you can’t resist messing around on your phone or visiting time-wasting websites on your computer, consider installing an app or a browser extension that blocks tempting apps and sites. Don’t try to work with a TV or radio on. If you listen to music while you do your homework, choose something that’s quiet and not too exciting, like some gentle classical music. While you study, keep a bottle of water and some snacks on hand. Staying hydrated and eating healthy foods can help you wake up, focus, and stay alert.

Try working for an hour to an hour and a half and then taking a 15-minute break. This will give your tired brain a chance to rest and recharge.  During your breaks, you can go for a walk, have a snack, do a little meditation, or even put your head down for a quick power nap. You can also use your breaks to reward yourself with a fun video or a quick game on your phone. If you’ve reached the point where you can’t stand to look at your assignment any more, take a break and then try switching to another task for a while. This way you can give your brain a break (and get some variety) while still being productive.  For example, if you’ve been working on an essay for an hour or two, take a break and then switch to doing some math problems. Don’t try to do more than one task at once, though. Trying to multitask will disrupt your focus and cause you to make more mistakes.",
      "When you’re in school, it can be hard to stay on top of all your obligations. Setting a consistent schedule for yourself can help you stay on track and make all that work feel more manageable. Set aside specific times each day to do your studying and homework, and stick to the schedule as closely as possible.   Setting a schedule also makes it easier to avoid procrastinating. Make sure to schedule in time for breaks and relaxation, too! It may be tempting to put off big, difficult assignments for last and do the easy ones first. However, letting the more important tasks wait will ultimately lead to panic, frustration, and missed deadlines. Look at all your assignments and decide which ones are most important or urgent and which ones you can put on the back burner for now.  Make an ordered list of all your tasks. Try to prioritize ones that are due soon, count towards a major part of your grade, or seem like they will be the most complicated to complete. Put assignments that aren’t due for a while or that you know you can finish quickly and easily at the bottom. Large or complicated assignments can feel overwhelming if you try to approach them all at once. Instead, break them down into smaller chunks and approach them one piece at a time. This will help big tasks feel much more manageable—plus, you can reward yourself for each chunk of the assignment that you complete! For example, if you’re writing a big paper, you might break it up into pieces like doing the research, composing a bibliography, writing an outline, drafting the introduction, and so on. If you a hard time staying on task and organizing your time, productivity apps can be a big help. Try downloading an app like Todoist, Hours, or Any.do to help you keep track of deadlines, create to-do lists, and monitor how much time you’re spending on each assignment. Productivity apps are helpful for some people, but they’re not for everyone. Make sure you don’t spend so much time worrying about the app that it starts to cut into your homework time!"

      "Though your costume is almost finished, you will need a few more accessories to pull of the classic Peter Pan look. If you have a brown belt, cinch it across your waist over the green tunic. You can also tie a length of brown fabric or a rope at your waist if you don’t want to buy a belt. Peter Pan carries a small dagger at his side in a holster attached to his belt. Buy a small toy dagger at a Halloween store or a costume shop. If it doesn’t come with a holster simply keep it at your side tucked into your belt. Since it's a toy, there’s no chance of it hurting you!  Don’t use a real knife. Even if you want to pull of a great costume, it’s not worth the risk of accidentally poking yourself! You can also make a dagger out of cardboard and paint it to look like a knife. Wear a pair of brown or tan shoes with your costume, preferably moccasins or short boots. If you don’t have the perfect pair of shoes, don’t worry too much: people will be so impressed with your costume that they probably won’t be looking at your feet.",
      "The tights are the easiest part of the costume to plan. If you don’t already own a pair, go to a store like Walmart and H&M and buy a pair of dark green or greenish-brown leggings or tights. If you are buying nylon tights, try to purchase ones that are opaque instead of see-through. If you feel uncomfortable wearing leggings or tights, buy a pair of sweatpants or linen pants with a skinny fit. You can also wear green cut-off shorts if you don’t want to wear long pants. If you don’t already own one, buy a large shirt in a yellow-green color. Make sure that the shirt is a little large and fits like a tunic, ending midway down the thigh.  Make sure that you or whoever the costume is for tries on the shirt before you purchase it. The tunic is an iconic part of the Peter Pan costume, so a short or tight shirt won’t look as good. You can buy a regular T-shirt or polo shirt, or a shirt made from linen or another similar material for a more earthy feel. Peter Pan’s tunic is known for having a zig-zag cut along the bottom and the sleeves, giving it a playful look. Try on the shirt and use a pen to draw a large zig-zag pattern near the hem of the shirt and around the sleeves.  If you are happy with the size of the shirt, make the zig-zag pattern close to the edge of the fabric. If you feel the shirt is too big, draw the zig-zag higher up, so that you will be able to cut the shirt to the length that you want. Also draw a V along the neck of the shirt if it’s not already a V-neck. Lay the shirt down flat on a table and use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the lines you drew on the shirt. Try to cut crisply and cleanly so that the shirt doesn’t look frayed or ragged. Try the shirt on again and look in a mirror. If you notice that the zig zag looks uneven, take the shirt off again and refine the cut.",
      "The cap is the most work intensive aspect of the costume since you will have to construct it yourself. You will need a yard of green felt, a pair of scissors, a needle or a sewing machine, green thread, a hot glue gun and a red feather. You can buy all these supplies at Hobby Lobby, Michaels or another art supply store. If you don’t want to sew, you can do a no-sew version of the cap by simply taking a green beanie and flipping up the edges. Glue a red feather to one side of the beanie to create a perfectly good Peter Pan cap! Draw a triangle with a pen onto the felt. The shape should be roughly the size of the cap as seen from the side, so make sure to make it large enough for your head or the head of the person the costume is for. Don’t draw a perfect triangle, instead make the top tip of the triangle curved as opposed to straight and off-center as opposed to directly centered. To estimate what size the triangle should be, hold the cloth up to your head to get a good idea. Since the hat isn't going to be fitted snugly to your head, you just need to get an approximate estimate. Draw another shape that is roughly the shape of a knife blade, starting out as rectangular and ending in a pointed tip. This will be the brim of the hat. Make sure that the length of this section is about a ½ inch longer than the length of the rounded triangle you just made. Cut it out with a pair of scissors. Take the rounded triangle and the slanted piece of felt and lay them down on the remaining felt. Use a pen to trace around these shapes. Cut out the shapes with scissors to create identical copies of the shapes you already made. Line up the larger triangles by putting one triangle over the other. Use a needle and thread to sew using straight stitches.Sew the two pieces of fabric together along the sides of the triangle about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) from the edge, leaving the bottom open. You can also Use a Sewing Machine to sew the two pieces together. You are sewing along what will be the inside of the hat, so don't worry if your stitches aren't perfect. After you finish sewing the body of the cap, flip the cap right-side in to hide your stitches. Then one of the long slanted pieces of felt and place it so that it’s just overlapping the bottom edge of the cap on the inside. Pin the strip where it overlaps around the bottom of the cap. Do the same on the other side for the other piece of fabric, making sure that the thick ends are next to each other and the thin ends are touching. Using a needle and thread or a sewing machine, sew the brim piece along the bottom edge of the cap where you pinned it. Also sew lengthwise along the overlap where the two thick sides of each long triangle meet. After you are done sewing, remove the pins. Then flip up the pieces to make the brim! Take a red long feather and stick it into one side of the hat in the brim. Make sure that the feather is pointed at a jaunty, 45 degree angle. When you are satisfied with the way it looks, glue it in place using the hot glue gun."

Place seven shells into each house beginning with the house that is closest to your storehouse.  If you have more than 49 shells, then put the extras into your storehouse. If you have less than 49 shells, then some of your houses will have fewer than seven shells or may even be empty. Empty houses are considered “burnt.” If a player drops a shell into a burnt house, then that seed goes straight into his or her opponent’s storehouse. Play your next round of Congkak just like you played the first round. Observe all of the same rules as you play, but you do not need to count up the shells at the end of each round.

      "The congkak board consists of two rows of seven holes called the houses and two bigger holes called the storehouse or home. Each player uses the side of the board that is closest to him or her. Each player starts the game with seven shells in his or her houses. The object of the Congkak is to move your shells into the storehouse that is situated on your left-hand side. You move your shells by picking up all of the shells in one of your houses and depositing one into each of the houses to the left of the space. The first person to empty all of his or her houses is the winner.  You may also put one shell into your storehouse, but do not put any shells into your opponent’s storehouse. If you drop a shell into an empty house that you own, then you get to take all of the shells from your opponent’s house that is across from your house and put them into your storehouse.

Before the game starts fill your seven houses with seven shells or Congkak seeds. Make sure that your opponent does the same.  Both of you should leave your storehouses empty.

You can determine who will go first by flipping a coin, allowing the youngest player to go first, or letting the person who won the last game you played together go first.",

In this case, you may scoop up the shells from another of your houses and deposit them into other houses. Empty storehouses on your opponent’s side of the board will create an obstacle for you. During a turn, if you drop your last shell into one of your opponent’s empty houses, then you lose a turn. Try your best to avoid your opponent’s empty houses so that you do not lose any turns. The goal of Congkak is to have the most shells in your storehouse at the end of the game. During a turn, if you manage to drop your last shell into an empty house on your side of the board, then you get to collect the shells that are opposite that house. Take the shells from the corresponding house on your opponent’s side of the board and put them into your storehouse. After you and your opponent have both emptied your houses, the game is over.

    "document": [
      "When acting, it's important to lose yourself in a scene to an extent. Emotion is very fluid. As you act out a scene, try to let the emotional resonance flow through you naturally.  Allow your emotions to be fluid. If you try to constrict or control the emotional arch of the scene, your performance may feel forced. Try to really get inside your character's head and experience what that character is feeling. This will be easier to do if you have, as we discussed earlier, truly made an effort to get to know your character.  It is very hard to try to sustain or control emotion. While you should be aware of yourself and your body, you may find yourself suddenly being struck by a line. If you find your voice wavering or getting upset, go with it. Allow yourself to embrace your emotional response in any given scene. Humor can be a great way to shake up an emotional scene. As so many actors and actresses play up the drama, you can stand out in a scene by playing up the humor. Even in dark moments, there may be slightly humorous lines embedded in a scene. Try to focus energy on moments of levity rather than glossing over them. Your audience will appreciate a laugh between the tears and respond well to an actor who can deliver funny lines with ease. When playing an emotion, try to shake up the scene by playing that emotion in a non-obvious way. That is, play the opposite. This may make your character's emotions feel more intense for an audience.  If your character is angry, you may be inclined to yell or raise your voice. However, what about stone cold anger? You can instead convey anger through silence or quiet words. If your character is sad, maybe portray him in a manic light. Your character is trying to mask his sadness by appearing resilient and cheerful. When it comes to an antagonistic character, avoid playing the character as openly malevolent. Instead, play the character as polite, friendly even. Oftentimes, villains that appear cheery can be even scarier to audiences than outright angry villains. This may not work every time. You may want to do some trial and error in rehearsal to see if playing the opposite works. It's a technique worth trying, however, if you're acting out a dramatic scene. A scene should be somewhat self-contained. When acting out an emotional scene, do not try to change your character's emotional reaction too much in the course of that scene. Try to stick to one, overarching emotion and concentrate on that for the entirety of the scene. If your character is sad, play him as sad. If he's happy, play him as happy. You can change your tone, and the manner in which your character is playing an emotion. However, you should try to center yourself on one key emotion. When acting out a dramatic scene, you may be inclined to overact. Oftentimes, you lose control of your voice and end up shouting or talking too loudly. Try to be aware of the volume of your voice and keep your tone even and in control.  Even if your character is supposed to be angry, shouting too loudly can be a bad idea. You'll have a hard time controlling the tone of your voice, and how you're delivering the lines, if you're screaming on stage. Keep your voice somewhat quiet and even. Paying attention to physicality can help. If you feel your voice is inadequate when it comes to conveying drama, you may unconsciously raise your voice. However, tune into the physical when you feel you're not delivering in a scene. Do something with your body to convey feelings of anger, sadness, and frustration. This will help you feel like you're portraying your emotions effectively, lessening your need to overexert your voice. In an emotional scene, focus on what your character needs in that moment. Why is this moment important to your character? Focus less on the scene's significance to the overall story arch and more on its significance to your character.  If a character is arguing with someone else, do not focus on arguing against the other character. Instead, think of it as your character arguing for that particular relationship. Your character wants his relationship with this person to play out in a certain way. That's the fulcrum of the emotion in this scene.  Getting to know your character can really help here. If you perform a scene and feel so-so about your job, spend more time reviewing the work and getting inside your character's head. This can give you more insight into your character's needs, allowing you to channel them while acting.",
      "Crying on cue can be a challenge for many actors, but a lot of emotional scenes require crying. If you're struggling to find a way to bring tears to your character's eyes, try using reverse psychology. Thinking as your character, think to yourself, \"I'm not going to cry. No matter what, I won't let them see me cry.\" In real life, you've probably had an experience when you've tried to holdback tears. Channeling the desire not to cry, despite needing to, can help trigger tears on stage. You can also consider moments that made you cry in the past. If you know you have to cry during a scene, spend some time thinking of sad moments before stepping onto the stage.  It may help to do a free write on the topic of sad moments, jotting down the saddest moments you can recall. This will give you a stockpile of sad memories you can use in the event you need to cry on cue. You do not have to focus solely on your own personal experiences. It may be too stressful to channel personal experiences. Instead, try to think of a moment from a book, movie, or TV show that made you cry. Crying is very much a physical reaction. If you go through the physical motions involved in crying, this may trigger actual tears. Consider what you do when you cry in real life. Maybe you start to breathe heavily, sniffle, and make small sobbing sounds. Start to engage in these actions. You may find that, in response, your body produces tears. If you're really in a bind to make yourself cry, you can look at the stage lights. Bright stage lights may irritate the eyes, resulting in tears. Many professional actors use this trick if they're struggling to cry in a particular scene.",
      "Before acting out an emotional scene, take a minute to familiarize yourself with the context of that scene. Understanding what's happening around a scene can help you better understand your character's motivation and emotions.  Read the scene in full. If you have the time, read the full script from which the scene is taken. This will give you a sense of what is at stake in this moment. Consider the character you're playing. What is this character feeling during this scene? How does this character's past, present, and future come into play during the scene? What is the context of this moment? If a character is yelling, arguing, or crying, there was obviously some buildup to this point. Try to look for the complex underlying layers of a character in a dramatic scene. For example, a character may be crying at his father's funeral. He is sad, of course, but there may be other factors at play. What was the character's relationship with his father like? What emotions might the character be experiencing? What memories is he recalling in this scene? For best effects in a dramatic scene, think about character over situation. Audiences are familiar with a variety of sad and dramatic scenarios. What makes a drama interesting is a particular character's reaction to that scenario.  Consider your character's emotional investment in a given moment. If your character is arguing with someone else, why is that character drawn into this argument? What is going on in the character's head on a deeper level?  A good experiment to help can be a free write in which you write from a character's point of view. Try to imagine how that character is feeling in this moment. Pretend you're the character, writing a diary entry after the scene took place. Really dig deep, considering the character's past and present, and try to write how you imagine the character feels. Audiences get bored with drama for the sake of drama. If you can show why this dramatic moment matters, in context of a specific character, this will ground your audience. They may respond more favorably to your performance. While scanning your scene, take note of exclamation points that appear in the writing. Actors are often unsure how to handle exclamation points. Do they signal that your character should talk louder? Do they signal excitement, anger, fear? The answer depends on the scene's context. You should understand the use of exclamation points, and how you should read them, going into a scene.  An exclamation point usually indicates a line should be delivered with slightly more force. However, the added force can stem from a variety of reasons. A character may be overjoyed. However, she may also be frightened or angry. Read the scene in full to get a sense of how to deliver a line with an exclamation point at the end. A line like, \"What a beautiful day!\" can be read several different ways depending on context. If your character is exhausted after having a long fight with her mother, it likely indicates frustration. You could read the line with a sarcastic tone. If the line is delivered during the main character's wedding day, it may indicate joy. You can deliver the line with an upbeat, excited tone. Actors often get so caught up in portraying the emotion of a scene they forget the physical action in the stage directions. Physical action can often carry a lot of emotional weight in a scene. A character may, for example, touch his or her face when talking, indicating he or she is nervous. Make sure you read the scene for physical action and incorporate that action into your performance.  A lot of physicality goes into a scene. What the characters are doing in a scene speaks volumes. Read stage directions carefully and see how your character moves. Maybe your character keeps rearranging furniture nervously while talking, for example. Make sure to incorporate this into your performance. You should also strive to pay attention to your body, even if there are not specific stage directions. In acting, you'll use your entire body to convey emotion. How might a character stand if he's feeling tense? How might a happy person gesticulate? Keep character emotions in mind and try to use your body to reflect what a character is feeling."

    "document": [
      "Depending on your history and severity of your gallbladder disease, your doctor will suggest a treatment plan. Your treatment plan can include watchful waiting, diet modifications, medication, shock-wave therapy, or elective surgery. Fasting and starvation diets can make your illness worse because they make your bile even more likely to turn into gallstones. You might need to get IV (intravenous, or into your vein) fluids so you don’t get dehydrated. If you have an infection in your gallbladder, you will need antibiotics. Take them exactly as prescribed. Your doctor may also give you pain medication to make you more comfortable. Use these only as directed, and don’t take more than your doctor tells you to. Cholecystitis often comes back and can sometimes be severe, so you may need surgery to remove your gallbladder. When you have surgery will depend on how serious your symptoms are – sometimes it will be within two days of seeing your doctor, but other times you may be able to wait a little while. If a tumor is causing your gallbladder problems, you will need to have it removed.  Most gallbladder surgeries are done with small instruments and cameras through tiny incisions (laparoscopic surgery), so you won’t even have big scars. You don’t need your gallbladder! Other parts of your body can take over your gallbladder’s job once it’s removed. You should be able to return to your normal activities in about two weeks if you have laparoscopic surgery. In the meantime, take time off of work to rest. Don't drive for the first week. Incorporate slow walking into your day after a few days of rest, and gradually increase your activity. Start eating a normal, healthy diet when you get home from the hospital. Ask your doctor if you have any specific questions about recovery. Ask your doctor for recovery guidelines if you have open surgery. Open surgery requires more extensive recovery than laparoscopic surgery. If you can’t have surgery for some reason, ask your doctor about medications. The medications ursodiol (Actigall) and chenodiol (Chenix) can dissolve some kinds of gallstones, but this can take months or even years to work. Your gallstones might also return once the treatment is stopped, so this options isn’t the best choice if you can have surgery instead. Only about 15% of people with gallstones can successfully use shockwave treatment, called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy. This uses painless shock waves to break up stones while you sit in a bath. Ask your doctor if this may work for you. It’s most effective if you have only one gallstone that’s smaller than 2cm in diameter. Alternative medicine practitioners suggest a gallbladder cleanse to break up gallstones – a mix of olive oil, herbs, and fruit juice (there’s no set specific recipe). There’s no data showing these work, and they may be risky to your health. Talk to your doctor first if you're interested in trying one.",
      "Go to the hospital prepared to participate in testing. You will probably have a blood sample taken, and they may look at your gallbladder with an ultrasound machine or CT scan. Do these important tests as soon as your doctor recommends it.  You may also need a HIDA scan – a test that watches how bile moves in and out of your gallbladder. This involves injecting radioactive dye into your body. Tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney problems before this test. A procedure call ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) can both diagnose and remove gallstones. It does not remove your gallbladder. Limit your alcohol consumption to less than 1 ounce (30 milliliters) per day. Drinking this small amount is not harmful, and some women may even see a slight reduction in gallbladder disease when drinking this small amount of alcohol every day. Eating fatty foods raises your risk of getting gallstones. Eat healthy by limiting the fat in your diet, and eating a lot of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  Base your meals on whole grain pasta and rice with fresh vegetables. Eat low-fat proteins like salmon and skinless chicken. If you eat red meat, choose lean cuts and only have small portions. Keep a regular meal schedule and don’t skip meals. Fasting can increase your risk for gallstones.",
      "The most common indication of cholecystitis is pain after you eat, especially after eating a large or fatty meal. The pain is usually in your upper right abdomen. See your doctor if this occurs regularly or suddenly.  The pain can sometimes also be felt in your right shoulder, between your shoulder blades on your back, or in the center of your abdomen just below your breastbone. It may also feel tender when you touch your abdomen. Pain can last from a few minutes to hours. You may also have nausea, vomiting, or a fever (a temperature of 100.4°F/38°C or higher). Cholecystitis is often caused by gallstones that block the bile duct and cause bile build-up in the gallbladder. It’s important to see your doctor to resolve the problem and prevent complications like gallbladder rupture. Seek emergency care if you have stomach or abdominal pain that is so severe you can’t sit still or get comfortable. This can be a sign of a serious illness that needs prompt treatment. Have someone drive you to the hospital, or call emergency services for help.  If you get a high fever of 104°F/40°C or higher, or the whites of your eyes turn yellow, call for emergency care. If you have acute symptoms, you need to go to the hospital immediately for a prompt diagnosis and to receive intravenous fluids. A surgical consultation is also necessary.  Although you may not need immediate surgery, inpatient care and initial supportive care are necessary."

      "Don’t be afraid to be completely open and honest with your teenager about the concerns and expectations you have for him. Make sure he understands that he can come to you with any questions he may have. Explain that you understand that he is more grown up now, but that his food allergies are still something that he needs to pay careful attention to. Listen to him when he tells you his concerns about privacy and about having his independence. Even though you may really want to get your points across, it is important to not dismiss these concerns. Privacy and independence are very important during teenage years and if you ignore these needs, your teenager will be more likely to tune you out. ” Let your teenager know what to do in certain situations by discussing “what ifs.” Let him know what to do if he forgets his medicine or if one of his friends won’t stop pressuring him to try a new type of food. What if an allergic reaction happens when he is away from home and around his friends? By discussing these potential situations, it can help you and your teen to better understand these concerns and anxieties about their food allergies. This may also help to build trust between you and your teen by helping you to see that your teen may already know the answers to some of these “what if” questions. By displaying your confidence in your teen, it will help him to follow the guidelines he needs to follow when it comes to his food allergies. Letting him know that you are confident in his ability to handle things on his own, lets him know that you are willing to work with him to keep him safe when he is away from the comfort of his own home.",
      "Using role-playing to prepare for situations can make the preparation a little more fun for you and your child. Prepare for common situations like ordering out in a restaurant or telling a friend that your child cannot have a certain type of food when it is offered to him.  This is especially helpful as the child gets older. Work with your child to create a plan for a school event or a friend’s party by understanding what makes him feel comfortable and uncomfortable in certain situations. By including him in the process, he will be more likely to follow the plan that is laid out.",
      "By modeling these behaviors to your child, it will get him in the routine of always doing these things whether he is at home or away from home. He will become comfortable with these routines and it will not feel like a challenge to complete them every time he eats.",
      "No child wants to feel weird or different from his friends. Help him realize that his allergy is not a big deal by making sure he will not have to read labels or talk about his allergy in front of his friends. Make a food plan for your child before he goes out with his friends and discuss it with him so that he knows what he will be eating in advance and won’t have to think about it while he is out. For younger children that are not your own, speak with the parents who will be in charge of your child while he is out. Inform them of his food allergy and be very specific about what he can and cannot eat. Also make sure your child is well aware of what to do in case of an attack when he is out by himself. Food allergies can cause some children a great deal of anxiety. This is why it is important to always remain calm when talking about their allergy and to use a matter-of-fact tone when conveying information about the allergy."

It's a green button near the top of the page. This is on the left side of the page. Below the Personal Use, click the operating system for which you want to download the installer. This will prompt the installer file to begin downloading onto your computer. You may need to specify a save location or click Save File before the file will download. Double-click the downloaded file, then click through the on-screen prompts until you've installed Novabench. On a Mac, you'll drag the Novabench app icon onto the \"Applications\" folder icon to begin the installation process.",
      "You'll need to know your video card's full name in order to find it on Novabench's score page, and you should remember the score your video card received to compare it with the average score for your video card. Go to https://novabench.com/parts/gpu in your computer's web browser. This link is just above the search box near the top of the page. In most web browsers, you can press Ctrl+F (Windows) or ⌘ Command+F (Mac) to open the page search text box in the upper-right side of the page. You may have to click the text box before proceeding. Type in the name of your video card as specified by Novabench. Doing so will locate your video card on the Novabench page. In some cases, typing in the full name of your video card will take you to that result on this page. If so, you don't need to press ↵ Enter. You'll see the score to the right of the video card's name. Ideally, your computer's benchmark score will be at or above this score.  For example, if your GPU's score is higher than the one noted on Novabench's page, your video card is running above average. If your GPU's score is significantly lower than the one noted on Novabench's page, you are either running too many programs at once or your video card is beginning to fail.",

Novabench may open automatically after the installation completes. You'll find your video card to the right of the \"Graphics\" heading in the middle of the Novabench window. You'll also see your video card's temperature here. Keep an eye on this—if you notice a huge spike in temperature during the benchmark test, your video card may be inadequately ventilated or cooled. This button is in the middle of the window. Novabench will run a few diagnostic tests before proceeding to the GPU (video card) test. During the GPU test—which resembles a 3D animated scene playing out—look at the \"FPS\" number in the upper-left side of the window.  If the FPS is below 30, your computer's video card is struggling to render the test. An FPS value below 60 indicates that your computer won't handle some high-resolution video games. Below the \"GPU\" heading, you'll see a three-digit score. This is your video card's current score under your computer's current circumstances. Now that you have the score, you can compare your video card to the video card's average score on Novabench's website. A score of below 400 to 500 indicates that your video card can't handle hefty operations such as intensive HD video editing, high-quality gaming, and so on."

      "When trying to get past a writing block or a brainstorming lag, take at least ten minutes to sit down and write. Force yourself to write for the full ten minutes, no matter what comes of it. The act of putting pen to paper will  stimulate the part of your mind that generates ideas. Mind mapping is a brainstorming strategy that allows you to map out different tangents of thought to stimulate new ideas. Get a piece of paper, poster board, or whiteboard and write your goal in the center. Write subtopics and related thoughts around the goal, and continue branching out from them to develop your train of thought. For example, a mind map about the environmental goal \"Going Green\" could branch into subtopics such as \"Reducing Waste\", \"Eco-travel\", and \"Global Warming\". For a fresh perspective on a topic, attempt \"rolestorming\". Picture yourself as someone else (e.g. a parent, friend, colleague, or partner) and imagine how you would approach a scenario as them. You can extend this brainstorming technique to famous people or historical figures (e.g. Albert Einstein, Bill Gates). To open your mind to new ideas, try meditation. Find a peaceful place to sit quietly and focus on the question at hand (e.g. \"How can I promote my new business on my limited budget?\"). Bring a pen and paper to jot down ideas, and meditate for about 30 minutes, or until a good idea comes to you. To avoid worrying about the time, set an alarm on your phone to signal the 30 minute mark). Remove the limitations that may be hindering your brainstorming progress by approaching the subject as if there were no obstacles. While this process may not yield feasible solutions right away, it will open your mind to possibilities you would not look at otherwise. For instance, when planning a surprise party, you might overlook certain venues because of financial constraints, such as an expensive French restaurant that your friend would love to try. By allowing your mind to go there during brainstorming, you might get the idea to simulate the restaurant and meal for a house party. Group brainstorming sessions can allow you to develop your thoughts by feeding off of the ideas of others. If you are working on a group project or collaboration, schedule brainstorming time in a quiet location with few distractions. If you are working on your own project, ask friends or colleagues if you can bounce ideas off of them and get their input.",
      "Exercising can raise your focus for 2-3 hours, upping your brainstorming power. It can also boost your mood by raising serotonin levels in the  brain, and increase your overall productivity. To keep your mind in top shape, get at least  thirty minutes of exercise a day (e.g. walking, running, bicycling), preferably before you sit down to work out ideas. Make sure to get adequate sleep to reach your full creative and intellectual potential. Lack of sleep can cause loss of focus, lapses in memory, and may contribute to depression. The required amount of sleep for optimal functioning is:  9-11 hours a day for children 8.5-9.5 hours a day for teenagers 7-9 hours a day for adults Eating a well-balanced, healthy diet is integral to improving brain function. Try to infuse your diet with \"smart” foods that aid with cognitive function and improve concentration. These foods include:  Fish Whole grains Nuts Dark chocolate Blueberries",
      "A new experience can offer exactly the change of perspective you need to stimulate new ideas. Do something out of the ordinary to get out of your routine and provide inspiration. For instance, if you live in the city, plan a camping weekend for a change of pace. For inspiration, look to motivational speakers by attending lectures or watching TED talks. Check the websites for local universities to see listing of scheduled lectures that might provide you with the proper inspiration. Visit www.TED.com/talks to browse a large library of motivational talks by topic. Music can complement your brainstorming sessions, or be the inspiration for your ideas in and of itself. Try to listen to a wide range of music to vary your musical experience (e.g. if you're a fan of classic rock, make an effort to listen to jazz or R&B music for a new experience). Look online or in local newspapers for concerts or smaller performances near you."

      "Before you start drilling, make sure you have eye protection to stop any metal shrapnel or sparks. The slivers of steel the drill can toss up are sharp and could cause damage to your eyes. Consider wearing a long-sleeved shirt and closed-toe shoes before working with metal. Find the divot you created on the steel and place the drill bit in it. Make sure you hold your drill straight so you don’t make a crooked hole in the steel. Use a low RPM setting and keep a steady pressure as you push the bit through the metal. Start and stop drilling often to give the steel a chance to cool down and lubricate the area. Drilling at a faster speed could damage the steel or the drill.  Use light, but steady pressure when drilling smaller holes so you don’t break your drill bit. If you’re working with a softer steel, stay consistent at a medium speed so the metal shavings don’t melt. Keep all your clothing away from the drill bit so it doesn’t get caught. Keep a firm grip on the drill, but ease off a bit of the pressure. Squeeze the trigger on the drill in short bursts until the bit goes through the other side. Keep the drill bit spinning while you pull it out from the hole. The drill may catch on the steel and try to spin in your hands. Keep your face away from the drill in case this happens.",
      "Use plastic clamps or metal C-clamps. Tighten the clamp or vice to your workbench so the metal is secure and will not move while you try to drill. If the clamp is loose, the metal could spin while you drill it and cause you harm.  If you’re working with a heavier piece of steel, you do not have to clamp it down. If you’re drilling through a painted surface, put stir sticks or shims between the clamp and your piece of steel so the clamps don’t dent or scratch the metal. Measure out where you want to place the hole in the steel. Take the diameter of the drill bit into consideration when you place your hole. Make a dot on the steel with a pencil to mark where the location of the hole’s center. Use a permanent marker if pencil doesn’t show up on the steel. Place the tip of the center punch on the mark you’ve drawn on the steel. Use a hammer to tap the punch slightly to make a small dent. This helps keep your drill in the right spot rather than it moving around while you try to make the hole. Use a nail if you don’t have a center punch.",
      "Repeat the process with a drill bit for the size you want the final hole. Place the center of the bit in the existing hole and slowly drill through it again, lubricating the metal when necessary. Pulse the drill bit when you reach the end of the hole.  For very large holes, gradually work up towards the diameter you want. It may take 3 or 4 different bits before you have the hole size you want. If you see smoke while you’re drilling, either slow down or use more lubricant. Some drills may have a level built into their body, but if not, use a level to make sure you’re drilling your hole straight. The steel and the drill will be hot to the touch by the time you’re finished. Give the bit at least 5 minutes to cool before changing it to a larger bit or putting it away. Use a shop cloth or a brush to wipe away any residue from drilling. Throw the shrapnel in a sharps container or separate bin. Make sure the steel is completely dry and free of debris when you’re finished cleaning it. Never wipe the metal shrapnel with your bare hands since it is sharp and could cut you. Use a medium or heavy rasp on the surface of the steel to remove any sharp edges around the hole. Work lightly so you don’t damage the rest of the steel. If your rasp fits inside the hole you drilled, you can also smooth the inside of the hole for a clean and uniform look.",
      "If you're only drilling a few holes through steel, you can use a regular high-speed steel bit. If you're drilling a lot of holes, or through hardened steel, then a cobalt steel bit or black oxide bit is a better choice.  Most drill bits are sold in a set with multiple sizes. If your drill bit is dull, it's not difficult to sharpen the drill bit yourself. Place the drill bit in your drill and tighten it so it’s held firmly in your drill. The smaller drill bit puts less pressure on the metal and allows you to drill larger holes easier later on. For example, if you want the hole to be 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) at the end, start by drilling a hole that’s 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm). Drill presses are heavy duty machines that make sure your drill bit goes straight through the metal with the most accuracy. See if there is a workshop around you where you can use their drill press or purchase one for yourself.  There are 2 different models of drill press that you can purchase. Choose a bench drill press for a compact option that will fit right on your workbench. Pick a floor model drill press if you plan on frequently working with larger pieces of steel. If you plan on offering metal fabrication services to others, consider getting a drill press for the most accuracy. WD40 is for getting water out of rusted bolts. Place the lubricant on the end of the drill bit and on the sheet of steel you plan to drill. This helps protect the drill bit and the metal to make a smooth cut.  Spray the steel periodically while you’re drilling to keep it lubricated and reduce friction. Look for a 3-in-1 oil with a telescoping spout so you can lubricate the drill bit as it’s running."

      "For new and small rose plants, it’s best to use organic fertilizers to avoid burning their delicate roots. Add nutrients to the soil before planting your rose bush, and after you first plant them, with natural fertilizers. Wait until after they bloom the first time before using any chemical fertilizers.  In early spring, before roses come out of dormancy and start to bloom, using natural fertilizers is the best way to get roses accustomed to new nutrients in the soil. Look for fertilizers labeled organic at a local garden supply store, or use the recipes in the homemade fertilizers section. To keep a steady amount of nutrients flowing into your roses’ soil, use natural fertilizers every 4 weeks from early spring until 3-4 weeks before they enter dormancy. Work whatever fertilizer you choose into the upper soil levels.  Spread solid or granular natural fertilizers in a circle around the top of the soil about 6 in (15 cm) from the base of the bush and work it into the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil with a small cultivator. Liquid natural fertilizers can be poured in a circle about 6 in (15 cm) from the base of the bush. Applying fertilizers too late in the growing season could cause young, soft growth that’s easily damaged by the first frost. To encourage your roses to begin preparing for winter dormancy, stop fertilizing them 35-40 days, or 6-8 weeks, before the first frost. In many areas, this will be around mid-August. Use the first frost prediction for your exact region to be sure.",
      "Using chemical fertilizers too early can burn new or recently dormant rose roots. Wait until after your roses’ very first bloom, and after you prune them in the early spring and see new growth, to use chemical fertilizer. This first fertilization is sufficient for most species types of roses. The numbers on fertilizers stand for Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium content. General-use fertilizers have a balance of the 3 nutrients, and come in 10-10-10, or 12-12-12, which is a bit stronger. Either is fine to use for most rose types. For granular fertilizers, work this amount of fertilizer into the top 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil surrounding your bush with a cultivator. Then water your rose thoroughly.  Liquid chemical fertilizers have different amount specifications for each dose, so read the instructions carefully before applying them. Remember to only apply chemical fertilizers after the plant is well-established in the spring. Always read the instructions for the correct amount of fertilizer before applying it. Some specialty roses, like hybrid teas or floribundas, benefit from a second fertilization in mid-summer. This helps them to stay healthy through the remaining summer months. Apply 4–8 oz (110–230 g) of granular fertilizer in a band around the base of your bush. Still other roses are known to be repeat-bloomers, and benefit from a third and final fertilizing in mid-July. This can also be beneficial if you have a particularly long growing season, or plants continue blooming through October and November. Follow the same procedures for this application as you did for the first 2 in early spring and mid-summer. If you’d rather do 1 chemical fertilizer application and be done with it for the year, try getting a timed-release fertilizer. These capsule fertilizers release their nutrients throughout the season in either 4, 6, or 8 months.  Generally these fertilizers use about 4 oz (110 g) per plant and are applied in May, but read the instructions carefully before using them Write the dates you apply fertilizer on a calendar to avoid over or underfeeding your roses. If you apply fertilizers too late in the growing season, you could get young, soft growth that’s easily damaged by the first frost. To encourage your roses to begin preparing for dormancy, stop fertilizing them 35-40 days, or 6-8 weeks, before the first frost. In many areas, this will be around mid-August. Use the first frost prediction for your exact region to be sure.",
      "A popular early spring natural fertilizer recipe can be made by combining 4 oz (110 g) Epsom salt, 8 oz (230 g) bone meal, 8 oz (230 g) cottonseed meal, 4 oz (110 g) blood meal, and 4 oz (110 g) fish meal. Water your bush thoroughly first, spread the mixture around the base of the plant below its outer perimeter, and work the mixture into the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil with a cultivator until it’s buried.  Water your bush thoroughly again after working the fertilizer into the soil. You can find these ingredients at nurseries and garden supply stores that sell natural or organic fertilizers. Another natural fertilizer method uses alfalfa pellets. You can use non-food grade ones, sold at garden supply stores, or rabbit food alfalfa pellets. Spread 8–12 oz (230–340 g) of the pellets over the soil under your bush’s outer perimeter, and work it into the top 2 in (5.1 cm) of soil. An alternative is to make alfalfa tea. Fill a 30 US gal (110 L) plastic garbage can with 64–80 oz (1,800–2,300 g) alfalfa pellets and the rest with water. Let the mixture sit covered for 3-5 days and stir it once per day, then strain any remaining solids from the water. Water your roses with the tea every 4 weeks during growing season. To use banana peels, you can either bury them and let them compost before planting your roses, or bury them 4–6 in (10–15 cm) deep under the outer perimeter of your rose bush. They will compost under the ground and provide new sources of potassium for your roses.  This method is best used in conjunction with another natural method, like coffee grounds or alfalfa pellets. Grind the banana peels in a blender or chop them into fine pieces to promote faster composting. Spread 48 oz (1,400 g) of used coffee grounds on a cookie sheet lined with newspaper. Allow them to dry completely, then sprinkle them around the outer perimeter of your rose bush then water it thoroughly. Make a liquid solution of this fertilizer by soaking 48 oz (1,400 g) coffee grounds in 5 gallons (19 L) of water for 2-3 days. Then saturate the soil around the bush in place of watering it one day. Grass and weeds soak up nutrients from the soil that can be reused as fertilizer. Fill a 5 gallons (19 L) bucket with grass clippings and weeds like nettles, horsetail, and chickweed and add water to the full bucket until it’s full of grass, weeds, and water. Let the bucket sit in the sun for 2 days. Dilute 8  fl oz (240 mL) in 80  fl oz (2,400 mL) and use 24  fl oz (710 mL) of it to water a medium rose bush. Use old, dry, composted chicken, cow, or horse manure for this recipe. Wrap some manure in a cloth bag, old towel, or T-shirt and place it at the bottom of a 5 gallons (19 L) bucket. Fill the bucket to the top with water and let it sit in the shade for 3 days. Water your roses with the fertilizer as you would normally water it. Discard the “bag” you used and the manure inside after each use or put in a compost pile. Choose a dog or cat dry food with a 3% minimum sodium content. Sprinkle 16 oz (450 g) of it on the soil under the outer perimeter of your bush. Work it 2 in (5.1 cm) deep in the soil with a cultivator and cover the area with cardboard for a week so that animals don’t dig it up. Keep the cardboard wet and water your roses through the cardboard just as you would normally water them before removing it."

      "Making a list of everything that irritated, bugged, or annoyed you about your ex’s personality and/or lifestyle can help you to see why it would not have worked.  Start by writing down as many things as you can and then keep adding to the list as you think of other things.  For example, maybe your ex had a really outgoing personality and often got carried away in conversations with other people rather than focusing on you. Or, perhaps your ex was really into country music and you can’t stand that kind of music. List anything and everything that helps you to see how you and your ex were incompatible. If you want, you can also include in this list anything that your partner cited as a reason for ending the relationship (if he or she broke up with you). Dreaming a little about your ideal mate can also help you to move on. Try making another list where you write down all of the qualities that you want out of your next boyfriend or girlfriend, or of things that you want out of your next relationship.   For example, you might decide that you would prefer someone who is more introverted, likes to read, and who enjoys the same kind of music as you do. Or you might decide that you want a relationship that is honest, genuine, and loving. You might even consider what you can do to improve the chances of having this kind of relationship. What could you have done better in your last relationship? For example, if you had a habit of texting your ex constantly, then maybe you can try to give your next girlfriend or boyfriend some more independence. Think back on the things that you and your ex used to argue about to give yourself some more perspective about your incompatibility. You can think back to all the little fights you had or even just one big one.   For example, you might think back to a time when you argued for an hour over what to do over the weekend, or when you fought because you caught her flirting with another guy. You can also reflect on any warning signs that the relationship was ending. For example, did you start to argue more frequently? Did your ex start to talk to you less and less? After you have reflected on some of the things that indicate why your relationship did not work out, you may feel like laughing a little at how mismatched you and your ex were.  For example, you could look back on a silly fight that you had over what kind of pizza to order, or just laugh at how different the two of you were in general.",
      "Doing anything to make you feel brand new can be helpful.  It’s amazing how something so mundane can easily remind a person of their ex.  Try to make several changes to feel as if you’re living a much different life than you were before.  Change out your playlists.  Whether they are for easy-listening or they are your go-to workout songs, make changes so you don’t associate specific tunes with your ex. Move furniture into different locations.  If you were used to the couch and your ex took the recliner, move them to different locations and claim the recliner. Use different towels in the bathroom.  Go for anything different.  Size, shape, color, design, texture, change to something foreign. Load your dishwasher a different way.  Put the forks where the knives go.  Place the plates horizontal instead of vertical.  Make it something completely new to you. Delete shows from the DVR.  This is especially helpful if it’s a show you started watching because your ex liked it. The great thing about being single is you now can choose.  You can choose the exact opposite of your ex if you’d like.  Leave all memories in the past and find the new love of your life.  Pick someone who appreciates what your ex did not. Be careful to avoid the rebound.  Don’t settle for someone just because you’re used to being in a relationship. Some people see a breakup as a bridge towards improvement.  Learn to communicate more effectively.  Discover new things about yourself, and how you can improve in the next relationship.  You can’t control everything.  Use this as a way to get over any control issues you may have.  Realize there are some things, no matter how hard you try, that will not be as you wish. Learn how to forgive.  You may be angry, sad, or depressed, but breakups often serve as a great opportunity to find our kindness.  You'll be happier when you realize forgiveness, because your ex will no longer occupy your mind with ill feelings. Express relationship desires more clearly.  The result of failure is often analysis and improvement.  Figure out what was expressed incorrectly or inefficiently, and learn to tell your future partner precisely what you want in a relationship. Keep in mind that a breakup is an emotional injury and it might take longer than a week to be over your ex. Getting over someone is difficult and you will have a lot of emotions to process, so try to be patient. Just remember that if you keep trying, then you will get there.",
      "Release your feelings.  This is the best thing to do, to vent out whatever you feel and just have some alone time.  Don't suppress any emotions - confront the things upsetting and angering you and release them, whether it be by crying or screaming into a pillow. Use your next day to talk it through, and sort things out.  Talk to a friend or someone trusted about what you thought about your ex, but think more about why you broke up.  Talking to someone else means there's someone to verbalize your issues with, rather than trying to cope with everything on your own.  Remind yourself why you can deal without this relationship, and list ways to help you start moving on. This day is for clearing your head and setting yourself a clear sketch of the future without your ex. If you keep anything at all, be sure to think of it a token of friendship, not of your relationship.  If they bring bad memories, then throw them out or dispose of them in any way you desire.  Take down photos.  If photos linger, it shows you are still thinking of your ex, and some studies show it can actually cause physical pain.  Be sure to return anything to your ex that you know could cause issues.  If you have something valuable, and it was not a gift, it may be best to give it back.  It’s possible to be found civilly liable if the gift can be deemed as exploitation of your ex. You’re nearing the end of the week; so, use this day for relaxing and enjoyment.  Going out with a friend is a good idea.  Company can keep your mind off of any lingering feelings.  Make sure you don't go somewhere that will bring memories of your ex.   If you opt to spend the day alone instead, make sure you keep your mind off your ex and firmly on you.  Pamper yourself by going to the spa. Go somewhere and do something your ex never wanted to do. Read a novel and immerse yourself in a different world. Quite a bit of research indicates the key to recovering from a breakup is focusing inward on yourself.  Spend some time re-working your goals, values, and reminding yourself who you are.  Brush up on your independent skills and do whatever you can to make yourself strong.  Cook a good meal for yourself, something your ex didn’t like.  Think about how nice it is to eat this meal without any issues. Go to a lecture or reading on something that sparks your interest.  Analyze the message and see how it reflects upon your current situation. Use this day to really stop thinking about your ex.  This is where you plan your next steps.  Lay the groundwork for what you’re going to do next.  Putting pen to paper will not only provide you with a plan, but it will be something to which you can self-motivate and hold yourself accountable.  Include the next day you plan to go out.  Even if you don’t want to go out, force yourself  to stick to the plan. Determine what kind of person you desire.  Think about who you want, and ways in which you will not settle.  Find your soulmate this time. Set a date by which you’ll go on the next date.  Don’t let your ex dictate your happiness.  Find the next person who will help you forget about your ex. The final day can be thought of as the graduation from your breakup.  Essentially, you've done all the hard work. Do what makes you happy.  Try one of the following suggestions:  Go watch a movie.  Shoot for a genre other than drama or romance, so you’re not reminded of your breakup.  Be sure to splurge on all the popcorn and treats you desire. Sleep in.  Wake up whenever you want.  Plan on being lazy all day with PJs, a cup of coffee, and a marathon of your favorite show. Soak in the rays.  Lay out – on the beach if possible – and just enjoy a sunny day.  Listen to nature wash away any last vestiges of your ex.",
      "Ensure there are no interactions or confrontations for an entire week.  If you don’t see them for a week, you’re likely to do and think about other people and things.  Avoid all calls.  Don’t let your ex explain away any wrongdoings. Don’t read texts.  What they say isn’t important.  Defriend them on social media.  Don’t take a chance of seeing something they post that could further hurt you.  Be sure you change your relationship status to “single”. If you can’t avoid your ex because of work or school, then avoid eye contact and all conversation. Each day of the week you’re allowed to cry or mope for a specific amount of time.  As each day passes, lower the number.  The last day should be focused on minimal or zero grieving.  Think of it as ridding yourself of a sickness, like the cold.  For example:  1st Day - 60 minutes 2nd Day - 50 minutes 3rd Day - 40 minutes (and so on) Whether you’re an avid bowler or swimmer, be sure to continue doing whatever it is you love to do.  Mix in hobbies that are social so you’re not always alone.  In the week following your breakup, keep your mind off sadness and do everything you would normally do to make you happy. Meditation has been shown by multiple research sources to help with physical and emotional pain.  Each day work on meditating for a longer period of time.  Start with 15 minutes of meditation focused on quieting your mind, ignoring your anxiety about the breakup, and build yourself up to 45 minutes by the seventh day.  After the seventh day you should find some inner peace. Many people go through a breakout and let themselves waste away.  They skip showers, don’t get enough sleep, and generally make themselves miserable.  Then depression results from looking like a mess.  Don’t let this be you.  Take care of yourself the week following your breakup.   Go get your hair done.  A new ‘do may help you feel better, and like a new person. Take a long, hot shower.  Wash every inch of your body, thinking of scrubbing away any possible remaining particle of your ex that may remain. Get a clean shave.  Even if you don’t plan on going anywhere. Often times people have trouble sleeping after a breakup.  A little Benadryl can be used as a simple sleep aid.  Try to doze off without thinking of your ex. If you are having very serious issues, you may need to see a doctor for an antidepressant or prescription sleep pills. Breakups can be emotionally devastating.  Because of the time and emotion put into relationships, there is actually scientifically provable pain associated with heartache.  Seeing a therapist can help alleviate repressed emotions.  Studies have shown discussing break-ups can help process them, and help you overcome it. You may have to see the therapist more than once, but it’s possible just a single session can get you over your ex. Multiple studies have shown writing to be therapeutic, and leading to less negativity.  By writing about the breakup, and focusing on positive aspects of it, you’re likely to feel more optimistic, confident, and positive about the reason for the breakup.  Try writing for 15-30 minutes per day for the length of the week, and you’ll likely feel a lot better about the situation."

      "Water can also get into your house from outside, and preventing this will protect your house from excess moisture inside. Along with fixing leaks in the roof and elsewhere in the house, you can also get rid of water by making sure that water is drawn away from your house.  One way to do this is by installing extra gutters if necessary to direct rainwater away from your home. If you have trouble with groundwater coming in, consider installing vapor barriers in the basement and a sump pump system that will collect water. Gutters are an integral part of the system that keeps water away from your house, so it’s important to keep them clean and well maintained. Clean the gutters every fall and spring to remove dirt, debris, leaves, and other matter. Address leaks in your gutters as soon as you notice them. If you can't repair the leak, replace the section of damaged gutter. A crawl space that has a dirt floor is susceptible to mold, because moisture coming up from the ground can make the area wet all the time. To prevent this, dry out the area with fans, and then cover the dirt with a sheet of plastic. Covering the dirt won’t necessarily prevent moisture from coming up, but it will stop mold from growing in the crawl space itself.",
      "Mold grows where there's moisture, so keeping your house dry is one of the most important ways to prevent mold. Install a hygrometer in your home, as this will measure the moisture levels inside. Ideally, you want to keep the humidity level in your house below 60 percent to prevent mold growth. To prevent too much moisture from building up in the bathroom when you shower or bathe, open a window in the bathroom to vent out moisture. If you don’t have a window in the bathroom, leave the door open and open the closest window you can. Moisture from a shower or bath that sits on the walls of the shower or tub can lead to mold growth. The best way to stop this from happening is to wipe down the walls with a sponge, towel, or squeegee after every time you bathe. It’s important to get your whole family on board with wiping down the walls after every shower. When you're doing laundry, don’t leave wet clothes to sit in the washing machine, as mold will start to grow on the clothes. As soon as the washing cycle is complete, remove the clothes from the machine and transfer them to the drier or the line.  If you need help remembering to transfer clothes, set a timer when you do laundry. Similarly, never leave damp clothes or towels lying around on the floor or bunched up in a laundry basket. Always hang wet things to dry. If you don’t have a drier or prefer to line dry clothes to save energy, always hang the clothes outside. Any water that evaporates from the clothes will otherwise hang in the air in your home, and this can lead to mold growth on walls, floors, and other surfaces. In winter, if you have to hang clothes to dry inside, make sure the room is well-ventilated, that air is circulating, and that air and moisture from inside are pushed outside with fans. It only takes between 24 and 48 hours for mold to begin growing on wet surfaces. To prevent this, address standing water as soon as the spill, leak, or flood occurs. This includes water on:  Carpets and floors Furniture Clothing Bedding Foundation walls and basement floors Exhaust vents are important in many rooms in your house, including the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room. In the kitchen and bathroom, turn on exhaust fans anytime you cook or bathe. In the laundry room, make sure the drier is being vented to the outside. You should also make sure that your crawl space and basement are properly ventilated. If the air isn't circulating enough, install vents or fans. Some appliances are equipped with drip trays that catch water and moisture. This includes refrigerators, air conditioners, and dehumidifiers. Make sure you drain and clean these regularly to prevent mold from growing in them. Emptying drip trays will also prevent spills, leaks, and overflows, which can lead to moisture problems under the fridge, near window sills, and on basement floors. Keeping the air moving in your house and providing a source of fresh air will really help to control the humidity in your home. When the weather allows, open the windows to vent out stale air, and use ceiling fans year-round to circulate the air inside. If you don’t have ceiling fans, you can also use standing or oscillating fans to circulate air. A dehumidifier will remove any moisture from the air that you aren't able to prevent, and will help you control the humidity in the house. It’s particularly important to have dehumidifiers in damp areas, such as basements and crawl spaces. If you have a large home, consider setting up at least two dehumidifiers in different areas of the house. Areas that are prone to being wet shouldn’t be fully carpeted. This includes basements that are damp or prone to flooding, and bathrooms. Instead, remove the carpet and install area rugs if necessary. Area rugs are better than carpet because they can be removed, cleaned, and dried if they get wet. Cold surfaces such as walls, pipes, and tanks are susceptible to having condensation form on them. You can prevent this with extra insulation. Outfit metal pipes with insulating sleeves, wrap toilet and water tanks with insulating blankets, and add more insulation to basement, exterior wall, and attic floors, ceilings, and windows. If condensation has formed on any of these surfaces, dry it immediately and inspect it regularly to keep it dry. Leaks are a main cause of moisture problems in a house, which can come from pipes, appliances, the roof, and faucets and taps. Inspect your home regularly for leaks and signs of water damage, and repair issues immediately. Don’t forget to check for leaks:  Under sinks Around fridges, water coolers, and ice makers Under floors, especially in the basement Around air conditioners Near toilets, tubs, and showers",
      "Keeping your house vacuumed and dusted will remove mold spores that enter your home, and this will prevent the mold from taking root and growing. For the best results, vacuum and dust your entire home weekly. Ideally, you should use a vacuum that has a HEPA filter, but this isn't strictly necessary. Along with vacuuming, running filters or air purifiers in your house will also help to eliminate mold spores in the air. Filters can be particularly useful in damp areas like bathrooms, basements, and attics, as well as near entryways like doors and windows. HEPA filters are among the most effective filters, and are able to remove over 99 percent of pollutants from the air. Mold grows best in dark areas, so allowing natural light into your house can prevent it from growing. During the day, open all your curtains to allow natural light in. The heat from the sun will also help to dry up any moisture in the house. In summer, outfit your windows with lighter drapes and curtains that allow light to pass through. This isn't always practical in winter, because lightweight drapes allow too much cold air in. Just as mold prefers dark spaces, so too does it grow better in warm areas. In the summer, use your air conditioner to keep your house cool, dry, and comfortable.  Most molds cannot grow if the temperature is below 70 F (21 C). Keeping your house at this temperature would be very expensive and inefficient, but you can still use the air conditioner to keep the air dry and relatively cool. In winter, keep the heat as low as possible while still being comfortable."

      "Preventing Pregnancy as a Teen"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Education is, according to the statistics, your best weapon in preventing teen pregnancy. It has been shown repeatedly that the more a teen understands about where babies come from and how they can prevent pregnancy, the better off they will be. Of course, it's possible you were taught incorrectly too, so you'll want to refresh your memory before educating your teen.  Educating yourself might also make you more comfortable about the subject, especially if you're from a very conservative background. You can find information on sex from books in your local library, at a doctor's office, and even on the internet. When kids don’t get educated about sex, they’ll try to make their best guess about how stuff works. Often, those guesses are horribly, hilariously wrong. Now, as funny as some of these ideas can be (“You can get pregnant from kissing!”), sometimes misinformation can lead to your teen getting pregnant or getting someone else pregnant. You’ll want to make sure that any misconceptions they have are thoroughly dealt with so that they can make good choices for themselves.  You can find examples of pregnancy myths in the section of this article for teens. The best way to find out what bad ideas your teen has about sex is to talk to them about what they know. Ask them: “What do you know about sex? How does a woman get pregnant? What role does a man play? How do you think pregnancy can be prevented?” Even with open communication and a good relationship between the two of you, your teen might still feel uncomfortable about asking for what they need when it comes to preventing pregnancy. You can eliminate this concern by making sure that they can access birth control without having to ask you directly.  One option would be to teach them where to go to get birth control on their own and at low cost, such as by making their own doctor’s appointment. Another option would be to let them know that you’ll keep a fresh box of condoms at the back of the drawer in the bathroom. They can take condoms without having to ask and you will replace them if the box runs out. Now, no one’s advocating here that you just run into this 100% liberal and promoting sex to your teen as if there are no consequences. It’s important for you to talk to your teen about what you worry about and how sex can go wrong. If you communicate your concerns in a healthy, non-judgmental way, you’ll actually e more likely to convince them that they might want to wait. Talk to them about:  The health risks The emotional risks, and The risks to their future Drugs and alcohol are also a nearly unavoidable part of growing up. While your teen might normally make very good choices, it only takes one night of bad choices to wind up with a pregnant teen. Head this off at the pass by letting them know that if they’re going to do those things, they need to at least do them in a safe environment. Tell them that impaired judgement can lead to poor decisions about sex or no ability at all to even make the choice. Girls should be warned about what boys might do to them if they pass out and boys should be warned about how getting consent is crucial to having sex but that alcohol can make you forget that. If your teen has goals and hopes for the future, they’ll have much more incentive to stay away from sex or at least be responsible about the sex that they do have. Help them pursue their dreams in order to keep them busy and make their goals seem reachable. Encourage them and help them believe that they can be more than they are now. If your teen’s day is packed with activities, they’ll have less time and energy with which they can get themselves into trouble. Don’t expect that this will make them abstain from dating and physical intimacy altogether but it should remove some of the opportunities and certainly keep them from having sex just because they’re bored.  Get them signed up for clubs or extra classes which let them engage in their interests and hobbies. If their hobby is something that they can do at home, invest it getting them some tools so that they can fully immerse themselves in that activity. If you don’t have the money to pay for them to take an extra class in their favorite subject, talk to your local community center or community college. There may be grants or special tuition available to help your teen pursue these activities. At the end of the day, you can’t control the choices that your teen makes: you’re simply not driving the car that is their life. But if you need to, you can direct their path by limiting the roads they can take. Pay attention to what they’re doing. If they’re dating someone much older (for girls) or much younger (for guys), do what you can to make sure that they make good choices. You should also talk to them if their dating relationships seem to be very “serious”. If your teens are going out a lot to parties, it might be time to reign in their behavior. While these situations aren’t always easy to control, doing something is better than doing nothing.",
      "First, it's important to know how birth control works. You might get misinformation about how it causes abortions or how it can do all sorts of terrible things to your body, but those things aren't true. There are lots of different kinds of birth control, from condoms to implants, and all work by making sure that either a man's sperm never reaches a woman's egg or by ensuring that that egg can't implant. Do research for each type of birth control you want to consider. Knowing how it works will not only make you more comfortable about using it or recommending it, it will also help you use it correctly and choose one which is best for your habits. Some birth control needs to be used in a very specific way or it won't work, so if you're bad at remembering to do things (for example) you might not want to take some forms of birth control. Birth control doesn’t just mean pills. There are lots of forms of both medication and devices that all do roughly the same thing: keep you from getting pregnant. Choose what’s best for you and, to be extra safe, use more than one method at a time. This is especially important for teens and people that aren’t in serious, long term relationships. You can use:  Condoms. Condoms should be your first stop, since these protect from STDs as well as pregnancy. It doesn’t matter what gender you are, you should have these on hand. Even if you decide to use another form of birth control, wear condoms anyway. The pill. There are many different varieties of “the pill” but all are taken by a woman to keep her from getting pregnant. These do not cause an abortion, as you might have been told. Instead, they make a woman’s uterus inhospitable to an egg, preventing it from implanting. Usually, you take a pill every day and the pill is very small. This is an easy an effective form of birth control and it has many other benefits (like clearing acne and making your periods more comfortable). Implants and IUDs. There are several different implants and IUDs (intrauterine devices) available, all of them for women. Some of these go in your arm and some are fit into your uterus. All are considered some of the most effective forms of birth control. While it can be uncomfortable to put in, these are great options for teens because you can get it put in and then forget about it. Most of these devices are good for at least 3 years, and some for as many as 12. This means that you wouldn’t have to worry about getting pregnant until it was really time for you to get pregnant. Other methods. There are also many other methods, like the vaginal ring, the sponge, and the patch. Talk to your doctor about what options might be best for your situation and habits. No matter what form of birth control you use, make sure you’re using it correctly. Most forms of birth control are very effective and work 99% of the time, but that’s only if you use them the way they’re meant to be used. If you’re a teen, learn how to use your chosen method correctly. If you’re a parent or adult, do your own research and then make sure your teen knows what to do. You can find information about how to use each form correctly on Planned Parenthood’s website. A basic piece of advice in life is that any problem you have can generally be made better by talking about it. Talking about family planning methods with your parent, trusted adult, son, daughter, or other teen can seem awkward. We’re raised to feel uncomfortable discussing sexual topics. But by opening communication and just getting everything out there, everyone can be better informed and more comfortable. Like a monster under the bed, you’ll find that discussing sex in a practical and healthy way is less scary once you understand it.  Now, it can take more than one try to have the discussion you really need to have about family planning. Don’t give up! Parents wanting to discuss birth control can say something like, “Jon, you’re going to have  a lot of urges. You’re getting older and that’s normal. But a big part of being an adult is being responsible about the things that you want to do. I want to talk to you about what your responsibilities are now that you’re becoming a man.” Teens wanting to discuss birth control can say something like, “Mom, I’m getting older and I want to make sure that I don’t ruin my future before it starts. I’d rather get birth control that I might not need for awhile than make a bad choice. Can you help me figure out what I need to know before something goes wrong?” If someone does become pregnant, it’s important to know what options are available, so that you can make an informed choice about how you want to handle the situation. Since society tends to be really divided on what to do in this situation, you should get as many opinions as you can from many different sources. One good source of information is Planned Parenthood, which will discuss all of your possible options with you and let you decide what’s best for you. If you decide to keep the baby, they will also help you find services and resources.",
      "Start by educating yourself about how pregnancy starts. Many studies have found that the better education you have regarding how sex and pregnancy work, the better able you will be to make good decisions regarding sex. You can find lots of high quality information online using sources like Mayo Clinic and Wikipedia. The short version is that a man produces a substance in his body, called semen, which exits his body through the penis. This substance is deposited in a woman’s vagina (through sex or other means), where it combines with an egg in her uterus to form a baby. Women only have eggs in their uterus sometimes and even then, the egg doesn’t always get what it needs from the semen. This is why you won’t get pregnant every time you have sex. There are lots of myths about how you can get pregnant. If you know the truth from the facts, you’ll be much better able to protect yourself. Remember, when it doubt, play it safe. It’s better to wait until you have proper protection than risk getting pregnant because of something you read on Tumblr.  Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you have sex during your period.” Your body will usually release an egg half-way in between your periods...but loads of women can have an egg release just about any time in their cycle. In fact, this method may be more likely to get some women pregnant, so don’t rely on this to help you.  Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use the pull-out method.” The pull-out method is when the guy pulls his penis out of the vagina before ejaculating or “cumming” (orgasming and releasing his semen). The problem is that the penis will release fluid before ejaculation that can still get a girl pregnant! Using the pull-out method is very unreliable and for most people, the chances of getting pregnant with this form of “birth control” is about 30%.  Myth: “You can’t get pregnant if you use certain positions or have sex in certain places.” It doesn’t matter if you’re having sex in a pool/hot tub or if the girl is on top during sex. If there’s a penis in a vagina, pregnancy can happen.  Myth: “You can get pregnant if you do _______ afterwards.” Unless that blank is filled with medication or medical devices like Plan B or an IUD, then this is a total myth. Jumping jacks, douching, showering, peeing, eating certain foods: you name it, these things won’t help keep you from getting pregnant. We don’t want to sound like that guy at your church, but abstinence really is your best bet at not getting pregnant. Even the most effective forms of birth control only work most of the time. If you want to guarantee that you won’t get pregnant, find other ways of getting sexual release that don’t involve penetration.  Pregnancy isn’t the only risk of sex, either. It’s important to remember that. You also need to be safe and use protection to keep yourself from getting STDs.  There are also merits to taking things slow, in your relationship. While sex is fun and feels good, it adds a lot of complication. You might think you’ll have fewer problems once you start having sex but really you’ll have more. This is why, if you can make it work, it’s better to stay abstinent until you’re in a place in your life where you’re better able to deal with those complications. Full, penetrative sex isn’t the only way to get sexual release. If you don’t have access to birth control or if you just want to be super sure that you don't get pregnant or get anyone else pregnant, try other ways of getting physical that don't lead to babies.  Try something like mutual masturbation. This is where you stimulate yourself in front of your partner or you stimulate each other. As long as no penetration occurs and the man's semen is kept away from the vagina, no pregnancy can occur. This is also relatively safe in terms of protecting you from disease. You can try something like oral or anal sex. This should still be done with a condom, however, because both can still spread disease and infections. Talk to an adult that you trust about sex, sexual health, relationships, and pregnancy. They should at least be able to give you some advice. They might even be able to help you find resources so that you can better protect yourself from getting pregnant. Schedule some private time to talk with them and then tell them why you want to talk. It might be awkward at first and it might take more than one conversation, but you’ll find that having someone who can help you will make you much more comfortable and happy. Say something like, “Brian, I’m not comfortable going to mom and dad, but I really want to get intimate with my girlfriend and I’m worried about her getting pregnant. Can you help me choose the right condoms?” In lots of states, you can get birth control from doctors and pharmacies without your parents legally needing to be told. If you don’t feel comfortable talking to your family about your situation, make an appointment with an organization like Planned Parenthood. They’ll educate you and get you everything that you need at a price you can afford, so that your parents don’t need to know about what you’re doing.  You can find your local Planned Parenthood clinic by visiting their website.  If you live outside the US or in an area not serviced by Planned Parenthood, check with your local health department to get advice about what services might be available to you. There are lots of reasons that you might want to stay away from drugs and alcohol, but one of the major ones is that both can lead you to make really bad decisions. When you’re drunk or high, your brain doesn’t work as well as normal (that’s why it feels so good). This means that while you might normally make the smart choice and use a condom, your drunk brain doesn’t even consider it.  You also have to worry about what might happen while you’re passed out. When you’ve had so much alcohol or enough drugs to make it so that you can’t move or are passed out, you have no control over what other people do to your body. For example, more than 20% of teen pregnancies were the result of sex that was influenced by alcohol."

      "Drinking water will not only keep you healthy and hydrated, it can also act as an appetite suppressant. Sip lots of water throughout the day to prevent your stomach from becoming completely empty, leading to high hunger levels and the need to eat. By drinking lots of water, you can focus on staying hydrated, rather than on your diet. You should also drink a glass of water before you eat so your stomach feels more full and you can then eat smaller portions during your meal. This can help you to diet in a healthier way. Be a smart eater by packing small, healthy snacks in your bag that you can reach for inconspicuously throughout the day. This will allow you to stay full without eating empty calories. It will also make others less curious about your diet, as you will appear to be eating often throughout the day via snacking. Snacks like raw almonds, dark chocolate, and veggie sticks with peanut butter or hummus can help to keep you full and give you energy between meals. You can also cut up fruits like apples, pears, and bananas for healthy snacks that won’t lead to a sugar crash later in the day. . Distracted and unplanned eating has been proven to lead to weight gain and unsuccessful dieting. Avoid unplanned meals or distracted eating by planning out your meals for the week. Go shopping at the start of the week, or on the weekend if you work during the week, so you have all the necessary ingredients to make healthy meals for yourself at home that adhere to your diet. You may organize your meals based on a certain calorie intake per day or a weight loss goal. Try to plan your meals around your required calorie intake per day, which is based on your age, weight, and your level of physical activity. Remember that everyone will have different calorie intakes and no one diet can fulfill everyone’s dietary needs. Another key component to practicing healthy eating habits is being aware of how you eat, as well as what you eat. Many people tend to eat in front of the television or a distraction and do not pay attention to how much they are eating. Rather than eat in front of the television, try to sit down and focus on your food as you eat, taking your time to savor the food. This will allow you to swallow and digest each bite, and keep track of how much you are eating.  To practice mindful eating, use a timer when you sit down to eat. Set the timer to 20 minutes and try to use all of the available time to eat one meal. You can try to eat with your non-dominant hand so you are forced to slow down when you eat and make some effort to lift and chew every bite. You can also reflect on what was required to produce the meal, such as the butcher who prepared the meat or the farmer who grew the vegetables and the grains. Though you may need your morning coffee to get through the day, having too much caffeine through coffee, caffeinated teas, or energy drinks can lead to feelings of hunger and fatigue. This could then cause you to cheat on your diet or eat an unplanned meal. As well, alcohol can lead to hunger and unhealthy eating, especially at night when you’ve been drinking for several hours. If you tend to drink lots of coffee or enjoy a few drinks on occasion, try to have a glass of water between each cup of coffee or each drink. This will keep you hydrated and help to limit your hunger pangs. When your diet is over and you have accomplished your goals, decide if you'd like to share your success with your friends and family. After all, people will likely notice that you have lost weight, and they may wish to celebrate with you. You can do this casually, if you wish. For instance, if someone comments that you are looking great and healthy, you might say, \"Thanks, I lost some weight recently.\"",
      "If you find yourself in situations where dieting comes up as a topic of conversation when friends or coworkers, use distraction tactics to change the subject. Remark on the latest television show or the latest movies. Focus on the latest office gossip or the latest news from a mutual friend. Shifting the subject away from a discussion on eating and dieting will help you avoid having to talk about your diet or address your eating habits. Keep in mind it may be helpful to share your diet with close friends or family, as they can act as a form of support and encouragement. Rather than avoid the topic with people you are close with, you may want to consider being open about your diet so you can feel you are not doing it alone or out of shame. Have a vague excuse ready of someone does decide to ask you about your diet, especially if it has happened around certain individuals recently and you have had to awkwardly change the subject. This could be something like: “I’m just watching what I’m eating,” or, “I’m avoiding certain food groups”. While having a vague excuse ready can be useful, you should try not to lie when asked about your weight. For example, it would not be a good idea to say, “My doctor told me I’m allergic to carbs,” when in fact your doctor has not given you this diagnosis. Using a fake excuse could indicate that you are ashamed of your eating habits and are trying to hide your diet by lying to others. This could also come around and cause you trouble if you are later seen eating carbs. To avoid the awkward back and forth with the server when you are at a restaurant, prepare for eating out by looking up the menu for the restaurant in advance on the restaurant's website. This way, you can look through the menu and create a meal that fulfills your dietary needs at your own pace, rather than do it on the spot in person at the restaurant. If you are eating out at someone's home, you may want to ask the home cook what she is planning to prepare. You may then be able to suggest certain dishes that might fit with her planned meal but still adhere to your diet. Even if the home cook does not agree to make a special meal for you, you are at least prepared for the meal and know what to expect when you sit down to eat. To avoid having to defend or address your diet, you may want to consider having your meals alone. This way, you will not need to hide your diet and can eat comfortably without feeling judged by others. Eating alone can be an isolating and unhealthy experience, especially if it is done on a daily basis for all your meals. You may want to consider instead eating around individuals who will not question your diet or ask you personal questions about your eating habits as an alternative to eating all your meals alone. This could be friends that are also dieting or individuals that you met through a weight loss program."

      "Tempeh normally comes in a cube shape, so it's easiest to slice it into squares. Round off the corners if you prefer your burgers to have a round shape. Each slice should be 1/2 inch thick. Use a nine or twelve-inch pan, depending on which size is large enough to hold all the pieces in a single layer.  In a small bow, whisk the soy sauce, olive oil, brown sugar, and thyme. Make sure each slice gets covered in plenty of marinade. During this time the marinade will begin to flavor and soften the tempeh. By the time you are finished baking the tempeh, all the marinade should be absorbed. If you still see liquid in the pan, keep baking the tempeh until the liquid is absorbed. Use a spatula to loosen the tempeh burgers from the pan. Place them on buns and serve with lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese.",

If you add the garlic too soon, it will burn; it only needs to cook for a minute once the vegetables have been cooked.

      "Playing Quickly (Basic Rules & Cheat Sheet)",
      "Thinking up Rules for Kings",
      "Playing Classic King's Cup"
    ],
    "document": [
      "A lot of the fun of King's cup comes from the \"house rules\" that have grown around it. Every game is different, and comparing games or playing with new people often leads to new and exciting rule changes. The following steps give 1-2 variations on each card, but you can mix and match them however you want. Aces are generally big rules, and often require the most drinking.   Ace is for race. If a player draws an ace, they must pick another player and race them to the end of their cup. Both players must finish their entire drink.  Ace slap your face. If a player draws an ace, everyone at the table has to slap their face. Last one to do so takes a drink. Two is almost always \"you,\" meaning you point someone out and they must take a drink. But there are some variations.  2 means shuffle. If a player draws a 2, everyone at the table has to switch seats with someone else. Last one seated drinks. In nearly every variation, 3 is me. But you can also use it as a \"direction shifter.\" If a player draws a 3, the direction of play is switched from clockwise to counter-clockwise. Four is sometimes used for \"women must drink,\" thanks to a rhyme with a certain nightly profession.  4 is for dinosaur. If a player draws a 4, they have permission to use a permanent marker to draw a dinosaur on the face of another player. There are a lot of variations on 5, including:   5 is for jive. As soon as someone pulls a 5, everyone must start dancing. The last person to bust a move drinks.  5 is for dive. If a player draws a 5, everyone must dive under the table. Last one to do so must take a drink. Six is often used to mean, \"guys must drink,\" thanks to a rhyming similarity between \"six\" and some common male slang.  6 is for thumb master. If a player draws a 6, they become thumb master. Every time they put their thumb on the table, all the other players must do so too. The last one drinks. This can happen at any point in the game until someone else draws a 6. Seven is another card with a lot of variety, depending on who you're playing with. Some people make it \"thumb master,\" or \"never have I ever,\" depending on the other rules.   7 is for snake-eyes. If a player draws a 7, they become snake-eyes and anytime they successfully make eye contact with another player, that player must drink.  7 is buzzing. This is a group rule. Moving clockwise, the each player counts up, so the first player says \"1,\" the second says \"2.\" etc. However, you must replace each multiple of seven (14, 21, etc.), or each mention of seven (27, 37) with the word \"BUZZ!\" Mess up and you drink, and the next card is drawn. Since 8 is so easy to rhyme with other words, this card has a lot of variations.   8 is for the hate. Choose a player, who must start drinking until you say stop. However, if they finish their drink before you say stop, you must play the same game-- but with them in control.  8 is for straight. There are two options for this rule. Either the player sitting directly across from the cardholder must drink or the person holding the 8 must drink a straight shot of any alcoholic beverage that the table deems fit. It must go down \"straight,\" without a mixer or glass of water These cards usually fill up whatever rules you didn't use with the other cards. Some idea include:  Draw again.  Minister of Foreign Affairs. This makes you the only person able to talk to people who are not playing King's Cup at the moment. Sometimes, if things are casual or the drinks varied, you might just skip the King's cup. There is a variety of ways to do this:  King's are table-slave.\"' If you draw a King, you must now do the bidding of the table, within reason. Usually, this means you refill the drinks and get new ones every time someone runs out, or someone else draws a King. Never treat the table-slave poorly -- you never know if you're next. \"'Kings are Categories:'\" If a player draws a King they can choose a category, such as \"dog breeds\" or \"types of car\". Then each player at the table must name something that fits into that category, such as \"poodle\" or \"Toyota\". When a player cannot think of something that fits into the chosen category within 5 seconds, they must take a drink. Some people play with 10 for Categories instead.",
      "To play, fan out a deck of cards, face down, around an empty cup (the \"King's Cup\"). Make sure everyone has a full drink of some sort. Players take turns drawing a card, then acting out the action described in the cheat sheet. For example, if someone draws a 3, that player must take a drink. If they draw a 5, all the guys playing must drink, etc. Continue until the final King is drawn or there are no more cards to turn over, whichever you prefer.",
      "With this rule, players are required to imagine that they have a little green man sitting on top of their cup. Throughout the game, they must mimic removing the little green man from the top of their cup every time they take a drink and put him back afterward. If they fail to do so, they get an additional penalty drink. With this rule, players are forbidden from saying the words \"drink\", \"drank\" or \"drunk\" for the entire duration of the game. If a player accidentally says one of the three D's, they must take a penalty drink. With this rule, right-handed players can only pick up their cup with their left hand and left-handed players can only pick up with their right. If a player is caught picking up a cup with their good hand, they must take a penalty drink. This rule is fairly self-explanatory. Players are not allowed to point at anyone or anything for the entire duration of the game. If they are caught breaking the rule, they must take a penalty drink. With this rule, players must pick a body part (lips, hair, ears, etc.) that no one is allowed to touch for the duration of the game. If a player is caught touching the forbidden body part, they must take a penalty drink. Again, pretty self-explanatory. No swearing is allowed while the game is in play. If a player swears, they must take a penalty drink. It might help to outline the list of included swear words before the game begins. Every player is given a nickname at the start of the game. If at any point a player fails to refer to someone by their nickname, they must take a penalty drink.",
      "Set up your game by placing an empty glass or plastic cup (the titular \"King's Cup\") in the center of the table. Spread an entire deck of cards, jokers removed, in a circle around the cup, face down. You'll have a full ring of cards around your chalice when you're ready to play.  Everyone playing should be in a circle around the cup and should be able to easily pick a card on their turn. If you are drinking out of cans, you can place an unopened can in the center instead of a cup. This variation is also a bit more sanitary since only one person will need to drink from the can instead of a communal cup. Each player needs their own beverage in front of them, and they will drink from it or contribute to the King's Cup as the game goes on. Each card in King's Cup, when drawn, means that someone has to take a sip of their drink, so if someone's drink runs out they should refill it or get a new one. You do not have to all have the same type of drink, though it does make the King's Cup, a mixture of everyone's drinks, much easier to swallow. Each action forces someone to drink. Usually, this is a casual, single sip. However, some people like to make rules for each drink, something along the lines of \"3 seconds per drink,\" or some other amount of time. King's Cup has a very specific set of rules which all of the players need to be familiar with before playing. Each turn, one person will draw a card from the deck, and each card is associated with a simple action for someone at the table. You should feel free to adapt or edit the rules for your game, since there are countless variations and rules, but a common set includes:   2 is for you. If a player draws a 2 (of any color or suit) they may choose another player who then has to drink. The chosen person must drink for the duration of time agreed on at the start of the game.  3 is for me. If a player draws a 3, they must take a drink themselves.  4 is for floor. If a player draws a 4, everybody at the table has to reach down and touch the floor as quickly as possible. Last one to touch the floor drinks.  5 is for guys. If a player draws a 5, all the guys at the table must drink.  6 is for chicks. If a player draws a 6, all the girls at the table must drink.  7 is for heaven. If a player draws a 7, everyone at the table has to put both hands in the air as quickly as possible. Last one to do so must drink.  8 is for mate. If a player draws an 8, they have to pick another person at the table who must drink every time they do, and vice versa.  This continues until someone else draws an 8. If either of the players forgets to drink when their \"mate\" is drinking, they must take an additional penalty drink.  9 is for rhyme. If a player draws a 9, they must pick a word and say it out loud, such as \"rat.\" Moving clockwise, each player must say a word that rhymes with the original word, e.g. cat, hat, bat and so on, and they must do so in under 5 seconds. This keeps going round the table until a player can no longer think of a rhyming word. That player drinks.  10 is for \"Never Have I Ever.\" If a player draws a 10, everyone at the table must hold up three fingers. Starting with the person who drew the card, that player must begin a sentence with \"never have I ever...\" and complete the sentence with something they have never done. If other players at the table have done that particular thing, they must lower a finger. This continues around the table. The first player or players with no remaining fingers must drink.  Jack is \"Make a Rule.\" If a player draws a Jack, they have the ability to make a rule that must be followed for the entire duration of the game. They could rule that nobody is allowed to swear, that it's forbidden to use the bathroom, or that nobody can call anyone by their first name. Any player who breaks the rule must take a penalty drink. Read popular rules ideas below.   Queen is for Question Master. If a player draws a Queen, they become the Question Master. Until another player draws a Queen, everyone can only respond to the Question Master's questions with another question. For example, if Terry is Question Master, and asks Steve \"what time is it?\" Steve would have to respond \"Is it 2 o'clock?\" If Steve doesn't answer with a question, he must take a drink.  King is for King's Cup. When a player draws a King, they must pour whatever they are drinking into the cup in the center of the table. When the fourth King is drawn, that player must drink the concoction in the cup, signaling the end of the game. If you're playing with a can, Kings could mean \"finish your current drink,\" or you could make an alternate rule.  Aces are for waterfalls. If a player draws an Ace, everyone at the table must chug their drink, starting with the player who drew the card. Each player may only start drinking when the person to their right has started drinking and may only stop when the person to their right has stopped drinking. So if you're sitting to the left of the player who drew the card, you cannot stop drinking until everyone at the table has stopped. Choose a player to begin, then draw a card at random. Turn it over quickly and then act out the card according to your rules. Once you're done, discard the card and move on to the next player, who draws. If playing with a can, slide the card underneath the tab of the unopened drink. As cards build up, eventually the can will crack open. The player who \"cracks the King's Cup,\" then needs to drink the entire can. There are hundreds of variations for each card, but there are also a few other rules that you can make that will spice up the game. Most of the rules are made to get people drinking more frequently:   Ring of Fire: The game is played as normal. Fan the cards out so all of them overlap. Any player who breaks the circle has to finish their current drink.  Color Kings: For all the numbered cards (not Jacks, Queens, or Kings), someone drinks for the number of seconds on the card. \"Red is to the Head,\" meaning you drink for the number of seconds. \"Black gives Back,\" meaning you pick who has to drink."

      "Aces are generally big rules, and often require the most drinking . If a player draws a ace, they must pick another player and race them to the end of their cup .

      "If a girl is interested in you, chances are she has already done some homework. Whether it’s talking to friends or following up on your social media accounts, she may drop hints that she knows something about your hobbies and interests. This is often a good sign that she likes you. This could also be a sign that she is interested in you as a friend and wants to get to know you better. When someone likes you, they will often try to establish an emotional bond with you through messages that create closeness. Common things to look for are if she chooses a nickname that she uses when texting with you. She may also try to connect with you by reaching out to talk with you about an experience or interest that the two of you share.  Does she text you to reminisce about a funny moment at school or maybe to commiserate with you about a particularly troublesome assignment or test you both have coming up? These may be signs she’s trying to connect with you on an emotional level.  Having a connection like this can also be a sign she is interested in friendship. Things like compliments and expressions of gratitude send a clear message that the person on the other end of your text conversation thinks highly of you. These messages can also give you hints about what it is she likes or finds particularly attractive about you.  Does she compliment your looks? Your clothes? Is she thanking you for doing something nice for her that day? You can learn a lot about what a girl thinks of you by paying attention to what she appreciates about you. Compliments don’t have to be straightforward. If a girl texts you to share happy news with you, she’s letting you know that she thinks highly of you.  If a girl is texting you to share something that made her think of you, that’s a positive sign that you’re on her mind. Text messages are a good, relatively low-risk way for two people to get to know each other a little better. If a girl is texting you details about her interests, her likes, and dislikes, pay attention as she may be trying to find out if the two of you have important things in common. If she’s following up these details with questions for you, she may be telling you she’s interested in getting to know you better.  Answer her questions thoughtfully and don’t forget to keep the conversation going by asking her things, too. This is also a good way to become better friends with someone, in general. If a person is into you, they’ll most likely want to share their thoughts and perspective with you and should be eager to know more about you. If the girl you are texting, however, repeatedly gives you short responses without much content or details about her life, she may simply not be interested. If you have a text exchange that leaves you feeling confused, take a break. Try texting her again the next day to see if her attitude has changed. If her texts remain cool and distant, or she stops responding altogether, you should move on.",
      "Casually proposing that the two of you do something together can remove some of the anxiety and worry you may feel about asking her outright about her feelings for you. For example, you can ask her what she is doing tonight or this weekend. If her plans are open or not fixed, you can share what you would like to do and ask her if she wants to go to along with you.  If she says she’s busy, it could mean she’s not interested but it could also mean she’s actually just busy. Ask her if there are any other days that she would be free to do something and see what she says. For example, you can ask: What are you doing this weekend?” If she says “Nothing” or “I was thinking of seeing a movie,” then you can say “I was planning on going to the movies, want to go together?” If a girl is texting you about a restaurant she really wants to try, a test she is worried about, a movie she would like to see, or some school event like a party or dance, she may want you to ask her about it. Follow-up on her conversation with a subtle invitation to do the things she is interested in, with you.  For example, if she has been talking about trying a new pizza place nearby, tell her you have also been wanting to try it and suggest that you go together. If there is a school event coming up that she has been texting you about, tell her you have been looking forward to it and see if she wants to go with you. Maybe she’s been texting with you about an upcoming exam in a class you both share. This is a great opportunity for you to suggest getting together to study for it. If all else fails and you still aren’t sure how a girl feels about you, you can always just ask her directly. If she is really into you, it’s unlikely she will say “no” if you ask her about it. Depending on how bold or certain of yourself you are feeling, you can let her know you like her first, and then ask her if she feels the same.   By making the first move, you are taking the pressure off, which she might appreciate, especially if she is shy. Be prepared for her to say she’s not interested. Humans are complicated and even if she has sent you all the right signs, it’s possible that she could still say she’s not that into you.  Regardless of her response, by being direct you will have a clear understanding of where things stand between the two of you. Even though it’s possible a girl may be confused about her feelings or may be unwilling to go beyond some flirtatious texting with you, no means no. If she says she’s not into you, even if you think she sent you mixed signals, you simply have to take her at her word and move on. If you ask her a direct question and she doesn’t respond at all, you can take that as a sign that she’s not interested. Ghosting isn’t very kind, but it’s not uncommon for people to simply avoid responding if they feel uncomfortable, awkward, or guilty about rejecting someone.",
      "When someone is sending you a string of heart-themed emojis, this is a good indicator that they are interested in you. The more emojis, the better. By sending you these fun emoticons, she’s is letting you know that she’s clever and funny. Certain emojis, like the kissy face or lips, are often used to show interest in something more than just friendship. If you’ve got a girl texting you memes, she’s likely trying to get your attention and build a connection with you. By sharing memes, which are generally meant to elicit a laugh, she may be trying to create an inside joke or play off something you both already find humorous. Humor is a great way to reach out and connect with someone and she may be trying to determine if you share the same sense of what is funny. Laughter and humor are important in lot of relationships, including friendship. If a girl is texting you late at night or first thing in the morning, she’s letting you know that you’re the last thing on her mind before she falls asleep and the first person she thinks about when she wakes up. She also may be trying to make sure she’s on your mind just as often. Regular “good morning” and “good night” texts are a good indicator that someone likes you. Photos of herself or pictures of what she’s doing throughout the day can mean she’s trying to give you a peek into her world. She’s trying to establish your interest in her life by sharing what she’s doing and seeing. She may even ask for your input or advice about things she shows you. Photos of her day are a way for someone to show that they are thinking of you and that they want you to be involved in their life."

      "Ask to take care of your younger siblings while your parents are out, or volunteer to watch young cousins or the neighbor's kids. People who already trust you will be willing to help you your first babysitting experience  Talk to your parents about whether you should get paid for looking after your younger siblings or relatives. You might watch them for free the first few times, then ask for a low pay rate, like $7-$9 per hour. Once you start babysitting other families, you can ask for higher rates. Ask your first “customers” to be your references when you look for other babysitting jobs. Write “Babysitting Services” or “Need a Babysitter?” in big, bold lettering. Then, write a little about yourself, like, “I love taking care of kids of all ages. Responsible, loving, and lots of experience. Ask me for references!” Include your first name and phone number on the flyer or on tear-off strips at the bottom. Don't put your last name or address on your flyers. Ask your parents or guardian to help you hang your flyers on bulletin boards at daycares, elementary schools, local coffee shops, and gyms. Remember to ask the facility before you hang anything.  You can also put advertisements in local papers or church newsletters. Check the back of the publication for a contact number and call to ask about advertising prices, or ask your parents to call for you. Ask your parents or guardian to tell their friends that you're looking for babysitting work. On these websites, you can fill out a profile with your name, experience level, general location, and schedule. Message back and forth with a family for  a week or so before agreeing to meet in-person.  If you're under 18, make sure to ask your parents before using a babysitting website. No matter how old you are, practice basic Internet safety when using babysitting websites. Keep your personal details private until you meet with the family in person. Look online to see what classes are available in your area. They're often offered by local hospitals, YMCAs, or Red Cross branches. You probably won't have to use some of the more intense training, but it's good to know how to treat a scrape or do abdominal thrusts to help a child who's choking. If you're trained in first aid and CPR, you'll be more likely to get hired and get a higher pay rate.",
      "The family will want to know a little about you, and will definitely ask what kind of experience you have with kids. They might get into more specific questions, too, like how you'd respond if their kid was crying or throwing a fit. Using your prior experience, come up with some good answers to these kinds of questions so you come to the interview confident and prepared. You want to show the parents that you're punctual. They don't want to hire a babysitter that will show up 15 minutes late to the job and make them miss their dinner reservations. You can ask to bring your parent or guardian inside for the interview, telling the family that your parents wanted to meet them before you watch their kids. You can also ask your parent or guardian to give you a ride and have them wait outside in the car.  This is an especially important safety tip if you don't know the family and are meeting at their house. You could also ask to meet in a public place, like a coffee shop. Talk about ways you'll keep their kids entertained and safe. Mention your experience doing typical babysitter jobs, like giving kids baths, cooking for them, and putting them to bed.  Give the family the phone numbers of a few families you've babysat for in the past, and invite them to call to get an idea of your skills. Remember to confirm with your references before you give out their contact information. Introduce yourself and shake the parents' hands. If their kid(s) are there, bend down and say hi to them too. Sit up straight, make eye contact, and smile during the interview. Show that you're eager for this job and can handle yourself like an adult. Ask them what a typical day in their house looks like, and what kind of things you'd be expected to do as their babysitter. You want to make sure your expectations are in line before you both agree to the job. You could ask, for example, “Will I be cooking for Jimmy when you're out?” or “Will you need me to stay past 11 pm very often?” Tell them if you have sports practice, play rehearsals, or other activities on certain days of the week. Although it might feel awkward to do this in your very first meeting, it's important that they know what your schedule is before they start asking you to come over on days where you have prior commitments. For example, you could say, “I want you to know upfront that I have soccer practices on Mondays and Wednesdays, so I probably won't be able to babysit on those days.” If this is your first babysitting job, ask for $8-$10/hour. If you have references or extra qualifications, like CPR or first aid training, ask for a few dollars more. If you're taking care of multiple kids at once, you can also ask for a little more, around $10-$15 per hour. You can base your rate on the area you live in. If you live in an expensive city, it's completely acceptable to charge higher rates. If people in your area typically have lower incomes, you'll likely need to charge less."

      "If you call up a shy girl out of the blue, it's possible that she'll give you an excuse to avoid going out. This isn't because she doesn't like you, but because introverted or shy-types like to have their plans in place. Shy girls need a chance to get ready mentally for a date.  If it's 4:30 on a Friday night and a shy girl doesn't have plans, she's probably looking forward to a quiet night at home. Make your plans ahead of time to give her enough opportunity to prepare. In general, try to make plans at least 1-2 days ahead of time at least. It's good to plan an activity for a date with a shy girl, so you'll have something to do together. If conversation is going to be hard, try to pick an activity that'll let her loosen up and have a good time, without having to do a lot of talking.  Going for a bike ride, bowling, or playing mini golf might seem like silly ways to go on a date, but it's a good way to keep yourself active and busy. You'll have a fun shared experience. Dinner is a good opportunity to talk, but it might end up being pretty awkward if you have a hard time talking together. Alternatively, movies mean you can't talk at all. Not the best choices. Make sure whatever you do is quiet enough for her to talk if she wants to. If you go to a booming club with loud electronic music, you'll never be able to talk. Shy girls aren't generally big partiers. If you ask a shy girl if she wants to go to a big dance, or to the football game, or to a loud dance club, don't be offended if she'd rather stay in and watch Netflix on the couch with you. Make the time that you're together special, even if you're not doing something that sounds like a date. Cook dinner together, instead of going out to a fancy new restaurant. This gives you the chance to do an activity that will get you talking, even if you're just talking about the chicken and rice dish you're making together. Shy girls are often intimidated by large groups, but you can always ask her about her preferences. While it might sound great to you to hang out with all your friends and watch football together in a huge group, it might be her worst nightmare. Try to give yourself some private time.  Of course, some girls might be more comfortable in group dates and feel more shy one-on-one. All girls are different. Talk to her and find out what she prefers and do what makes her feel comfortable. If you do go to a dance or some other kind of social event, come up with a signal that she can give you if she wants to leave or pick a designated time leave. Being shy doesn't mean that she doesn't have a strong opinion. When you're going out, give her the opportunity to pick the activity. This will help her feel comfortable and confident that you enjoy being together. Give her the opportunity to open up. Don't be afraid to take charge, though. Some shy girls might give you a lot of \"I don't know\" answers when you ask what she'd like to do on Friday night. Have a plan in place, if she doesn't. You should also offer more than 1 option to ensure that she can pick what she feels most comfortable doing.",
      "If you've got a crush on a shy girl, it can be hard to approach her at first. So just take little steps. Don't ask her out right away. Instead, start by saying \"hi\" on a regular basis. Whenever you pass each other in the hallway, make eye contact (this might be hard) and smile. Use her name, and greet her in a friendly way. Friend her on Facebook, or other social networking sites, to learn more about your crush. Talk to her friends to find out if she's dating anyone, or what kind of people she likes to date. Try to learn about her hobbies, how she spends her free time. Learn what she likes.  Often, shy people will feel more comfortable talking online, or texting. Becoming online friends first is a great way to get to know a shy girl.  Don't assume girls who act shy around you like you, or don't like you. Shyness isn't a sign of anything except being shy. If you want to date, you need to do more than say \"Hi\" and scamper off. Once you feel like she's comfortable enough with you saying hi to approach her, just walk up to her some time and have a short conversation. Make sure she knows who you are before you ask her if she wants to date. Keep it simple: \"Hey, my name is _____, we have Biology class together.\" Shy people are often quite good at one-on-one conversations but struggle in big groups. Don't try to engage a shy girl in class, or while you've got four of your friends with you, or it's going to be rough. Bring up something simple to talk about, something that you know you have in common, and have a short one-on-one conversation.  If you're in class together, just talk about class: \"I really messed up that last test. It was so hard. How'd you do? Do you like this class?\" You could also arrange to talk one-on-one at a later time. For example, you could say something like, “Hey, do you have a minute to talk right after school gets out? I have a question to ask you.” Lots of shy people fear that they're \"bad\" at having conversations, and don't like to talk because they're afraid of messing it up or being awkward. This usually makes it worse. Instead of drawing it out, just exchange a short little chat and then break it off. Say, \"Hey, good talking to you. See you later!\" If it seems like she feels uncomfortable, don't draw extra attention to it. Just end the conversation in a friendly way, with a small compliment. \"It's so good talking to you. You're funny. Let's talk again soon.\" Keep talking to this girl. Have your little conversations, making them gradually longer and longer. When you start to feel comfortable talking with her, just ask her out.  Keep it simple and keep it short: \"Hey, I've always noticed you and I think you're a really sweet and really nice person. I like you a lot. Would you like to go out with me sometime?\" Sometimes, things like dances or other big events can be intimidating for shy girls. It's actually sometimes better to just keep it vague: \"Would you like to go out sometime\" might be better than, \"How about this Friday?\" You can also ask her if she would prefer a social event or something quieter. For example, you could ask if she’d prefer to go to an upcoming dance, or just go to a coffee shop and talk.",
      "Shy girls are often, but not always, somewhat self-conscious. But even if a girl isn't self-conscious, it's a good idea to offer compliments to make her feel comfortable and loved. Keep them simple and genuine to make a shy girl feel more confident around you. If she does, she'll open up more and be less shy in some cases.  Don't pile it on, just keep it simple, and make it something that she has control over, not something abstract about her looks. \"Your eyes are pretty\" might be nice, but \"I love your hair like that\" is a great one, because she did her hair. You're complimenting her choice, not her looks. Make sure to compliment her personality traits as well, such as her intelligence, sense of humor, etc. Shy girls or introverts often need a lot of private time, and won't want to spend hours and hours texting with you or talking on Facebook. That's ok. It doesn't mean she doesn't like you, or that she's about to dump you. It just means she's being who she is. Relax and move at her pace.  If you call or text her and leave a message, don't get in touch again until she responds to it. You left the message. She'll get it. Let her decide how much of your relationship to share on social networking. Don't put up a bunch of pictures and updates about what you're doing together unless she wants to. Shy people might want to be more private than you're used to. The secret to dating a shy girl? Talk less. Shy girls will just want to be quiet sometimes. That's ok. Learn when to pull back and just be quiet. She'll open up and talk more when she's ready.  Just enjoy being together. If it's quiet because you don't have much to talk about, just enjoy sharing silence together. There's no need to constantly talk. It may even turn her off.  You can even tell her that you like sharing comfortable silences with her if you think it might put her at ease. Don't ask her why she's shy. Sometimes people will ask this question when they're feeling awkward. Drawing attention to it only makes it worse. There's no good answer to this question, and she'll just withdraw more. If you struggle to get a shy girl to open up and talk more, maybe it's because you’re not talking the right way. Ask her genuine, specific, and open-ended questions to get her to feel more comfortable and open with you. Listen to her answers and follow up with more questions. This has the added bonus of allowing you to get to know each other better.  Encourage her to talk more by asking follow up questions. If she mentions that she loves going to the lake, that's an opportunity to learn more. How long have you been going? What do you like to do there?  Keep questions open-ended to give her the chance to talk more. Don't ask, \"Did you have a good soccer game last weekend?\" because that only has a one-word answer. Instead, ask, \"How did you feel about the soccer game last weekend?\" Make sure to share some things about yourself as well. She might be too shy to ask you, so it’s okay to volunteer this information. It's important to be a good listener. If you're used to waiting for your own opportunity to speak, you might find it hard to talk with a shy girl. Use good listening skills and give her the chance to open up and share her life with you. Look her in the eyes while she's speaking. Nod along and encourage her when she's talking. Put away your phone and other distractions. Give her your undivided attention. Never rush a shy girl, or you'll lose her. Dating needs to move at a slow pace, letting her dictate the tempo of things. Shy girls need to feel comfortable, relaxed, and free with someone that they date. Let her decide when she feels comfortable enough.  If you want to move in for a kiss, but you're not sure whether or not it's appropriate, the best way to know is to ask her first. \"You look so pretty tonight. I'd like to kiss you. Is that ok?\" Don't try to \"cure\" her. There's nothing wrong with being quiet, shy, or introverted. If you want to change someone to date them, you shouldn't be dating."

      "A healthy diet is key. Focus on eating foods rich in protein and vitamins. Foods like fish, eggs, beans, soy protein, and yogurt will help your eyelashes grow. Salmon is a great source of omega 3 fatty acids, which helps to grow strong nails, shiny hair, and long eyelashes. A lot of women also take a vitamin B complex known as Biotin for longer and healthier eyelashes and hair. They may prescribe Latisse, the only FDA approved eyelash growth medication. The only reported side effects are eye irritation, general redness, and itchiness. Most of the time, a dermatologist will only prescribe Latisse for those whose short or non-existent eyelashes are considered a health hazard. Remember that your eyelashes' primary purpose is to keep dirt and other foreign materials out of your eyes. Over the counter solutions are available and might be prescribed by a dermatologist. Many of these over the counter solutions actually work just as well as Latisse for a fraction of the price. These include products such as Rapidlash, Revitalize, and Prolash. This is the most extreme method used to get longer eyelashes. Plastic surgeons can transplant hair follicles from your scalp to your eye lids. While this will give you longer eyelashes, recovery is incredibly painful and can impair your vision for several weeks. Since the hair follicle is different than normal eyelash follicle, some patients report needing to trim their eyelashes after their surgery.",
      "Use an eyeliner color that's a little darker than your natural eyelash color. The idea is to make it look like there is more hair at the roots of your eyelashes than there actually are. This will create an illusion of thicker eyelashes.  Apply a waterproof eyeliner at the waterline under your eyelashes to add the illusion of length without using up eyelid space. With a small push liner brush, push black shadow into the root of the lashes of the upper eyelid. This will give the illusion of a dark lash line. If you subtly extend the line at the outer corners of your eyes, it will also make your eyelashes look longer. If you want to try something a little more difficult, consider “tight-lining”. This technique takes a skilled hand and involves applying eyeliner between each individual hair at its base  creating a subtle line along the edge of your eyelid. If you can afford them, professionally applied eyelash extensions are a beautiful, natural-looking way to enhance your lashes. The process usually takes a couple hours and costs around $100 USD, but the extensions will last for months with only occasional touch-ups. If you decide to go this route, know that it will be more difficult to wash your face. You cannot place too much pressure on your lash extensions without causing them to fall out. You’ll have to wash around your eye or use a cotton swab to clean the actual lashes."

      "Identifying Woodworm at Home"
    ],
    "document": [
      "If you are having difficulty identifying active woodworm in your home (as opposed to other damage to the wood, or damage from woodworm that is not longer active) look online for exterminators in your area. Read reviews online and ask friends or colleagues if they have recommendations for local extermination companies. Call different companies for quotes and assessments before booking an appointment. Identifying specific species' of woodworm is incredibly difficult, and can result in misguided treatment attempts that fall through. Ask an exterminator for a professional assessment of your problem. Inquire about pricing and potential treatments before agreeing to any services by the company. Treatments could range from water based treatments for less severe infestations to fogging – a treatment for floors that generally does not require furniture and carpets to be removed. Once an exterminator has identified woodworm in your home, consider having them treat the problem right away. Over time, woodworm can cause significant damage to wood as well as serious structural problems in a building. DIY measures can be ineffective and time-wasting if infested wood has been left untreated for too long, so be proactive about stopping the problem before it gets out of hand.",
      "The Forest Longhorn Beetle and its larvae are only found on trees in the forest. Look for large bore holes that can be up to 10 mm (3/8 inch) across, much larger than most household woodworms. Note that tunnels will be very discreet and run against the grain of the wood. Waney Edge Borer woodworm can be found in wood that has bark on it, and is rarely found in homes. Look for borer dust with bun-shaped pellets around the bark areas from the boring holes. The holes are usually around 2 mm (1/16 inches) in diameter. Ambrosia Beetle woodworm is generally found in the forest; this woodworm can’t survive in treated lumber, and only lives outdoors. Unlike other woodworm species, the adult does the tunneling, going against the grain and deep into the wood.  Look for black-colored tunnels that are evident after trees are damaged or wood is cut (in a lumber yard, for example.) Wood Boring Weevil woodworm can be found in wood damaged by fungal decay. You can identify this woodworm by looking for tiny holes with ragged bore holes and coarse dust. Look for tunnels that run against the grain and often break the surface of the damaged wood. Powder post woodworm is generally found in seasoned hardwood, which is usually only found in furniture factories and lumber yards. These woodworms tunnel along the grain of the wood, and don’t attack old wood (wood that is more than 15 years old). Look for tiny entry and exit bore holes no larger than 2 mm (1/16 inch), and loose, flour-like dust. Deathwatch Beetle woodworm can be found in hardwood, (usually oak), that is partially decayed. Look for bore holes that measure up to 3 mm (1/8 inch) across, and boring dust containing large bun-shaped pellets that are visible without any magnification. If possible, inspect the interior of the wood; more extensive damage occurs inside the wood than what is visible externally.",
      "If you decide to investigate your home for signs of woodworm, look up pictures of infected wood online to get a sense of what you're searching for; short of seeing adult beetles themselves, damage to wood is they best way to identify woodworm. The Common Furniture Beetle, which attacks the sapwood of hardwoods and softwoods, as well as plywood, is the most likely culprit. Evidence of Common Furniture Beetle woodworm includes exit holes in wood that are 1.5 to 2 mm (1/16 inch) in size, short tunnels than run along the grain of the wood, and lemon shaped pellets present in gritty bore dust. Note that damage to wood done by the Powder Post Beetle, normally found in hardwood storage areas, can be confused with Furniture Beetle damage; research both. Use a flashlight to examine wood, particularly in dark corners. Do not shine the light directly onto the surface of the wood; instead, lay it flat against the surface so the light shines over, revealing any bumps, holes, or undulations. These marks can often be missed by the naked eye. Small holes caused by woodworm are typically found below the floor's surface. Start your search around the floor's edges and under windows, where adult beetles tend to fly towards light. Regardless of where an infestation has started, evidence will eventually emerge in these places. Note that while woodworm thrives in damp areas, it is capable of surviving in dryer conditions as well. Woodworm is often found in ceiling beams in household attics, which can cause serious structural problems over time. Look for woodworm damage to the ceiling joists as well as trimmers around the access hatch. Thoroughly inspect all roof beams that you can access safely, using a step stool or ladder, as well as walls (in particular, near the edges) and wooden furniture. Spotting the Common Furniture Beetle is a good indication that woodworm is present in wood in the surrounding area. Look for insects that are small, dark, and reddish in color, approximately 3mm to 5mm in length. Beetles will typically be spotted between March and September, during flight season when they emerge to mate. Advanced damage caused by woodworm is evident when wood starts crumbling around its corners or edges. Weak and damaged floorboards are also indicative of a serious woodworm infestation that warrants the assistance of an exterminator. Extensive wood damage will compromise the strength of wood and, accordingly, the structural integrity of a home."

      "Removing Stains From Silk or Triacetate",
      "Removing Stains From Cotton and Other Washable Fabrics",
      "Removing Stains From Leather or Suede"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Run water over the perfume stain on the silk or triacetate. Though silk and triacetate are not very absorbent materials, try to saturate the stained area with water. Water stops fresh stains from setting, and helps old stains separate from the fabric so that they can get removed. After flushing with water, drop on a few drops of glycerin and use your finger to gently dap the glycerin to cover the stained area. Glycerin helps to soften even old stains so that they can be removed. After you add the glycerin to the stain, run the fabric under water and rinse well, gently wiping over the stain with your finger. After rinsing, you should see that some or all of the perfume stain has been removed. If the glycerin didn’t fully remove the stain, make a solution of white vinegar by using a one to one ratio of water and white vinegar. Then add a small amount of the solution to a cloth or sponge and blot at the stain, starting at the center of the stain and working out. If the glycerin and vinegar didn’t work to remove the stain, add a couple of drops of denatured alcohol to a cheesecloth pad or to a sponge. Then use a patting motion to dab at the stain with the denatured alcohol. Denatured alcohol is poisonous when ingested, so be extremely careful when using it and store it out of reach of children. After you have removed the stain from your silk, flush the garment with water to remove any remnants of the cleaning agents you used. Then hang your silk garment out to dry.",
      "If you are trying to remove a perfume stain from cotton, linen, nylon, polyester, spandex or wool, first pat at the stain with a dampened sponge or cloth. Make sure not to rub the stain; instead, use a light hand and dab with patting movements, starting from the center of the stain and working out. Dabbing at the stain works especially well for fresh stains, because moistening the stain prevents it from spreading and setting in the fabric. If the stain is fresh, dabbing at the stain may be enough to absorb and remove the stain. If the perfume stain you are removing isn’t fresh, just dabbing at it may not be enough. To more aggressively combat the stain, create a solution that is one part glycerin, one part dishwashing detergent and 8 parts water.  If you just have a small stain, use one teaspoon or tablespoon of glycerin and dishwashing detergent and 8 teaspoons or tablespoons of water. Stir the detergent solution to mix thoroughly. After you have mixed together your detergent solution, pour a small amount onto the stain. Make sure to only apply the solution to the stain, not to the surrounding area. Once you have applied the detergent solution, fold up a sheet of paper towel and place it on top of the stain. Then let the detergent work on the fabric for about ten minutes. As the detergent solution works to lift up the stain, the paper towel will absorb the stain out of the fabric. After about ten minutes, check on the paper towel. If you see that some of the oily stain has transferred to the paper towel, swap the paper towel out for another folded sheet. Keep repeating this process until no more stain gets lifted.  If you notice that the area of the stain is drying, add more detergent solution. If none of the stain seems to have been removed, keep the original paper towel there and keep checking until some of the stain has been absorbed. If you still notice stain remnant after using the detergent solution lifting process, dip a cotton ball in rubbing solution and dab the rubbing alcohol over the stain. Then dab a teaspoon or so of rubbing alcohol to a sheet of folded paper towel and place it over the stain. The rubbing alcohol and paper towel will work in a similar way as the detergent solution, they are just slightly more powerful as cleaning agents. Look at the paper towel after ten minutes or so. If you notice that some of the stain is lifted, change out the paper towel. If nothing has been absorbed, place the paper towel back on the rubbing alcohol and the stain and keep checking until some of the stain has been lifted.  Add rubbing alcohol if you notice that the stain is drying. Keep repeating this process until no more of the stain is being lifted. If the stain has been completely removed, flush the garment with water to remove any detergent solution or rubbing alcohol, then hang the garment up to dry. If hand-removing the stain hasn’t worked, soak the fabric in a solution of one part water and one part baking soda for 10-15 minutes. Then launder as usual in the washer and dryer.",
      "Use a dry wad of paper towel or cheesecloth to blot the leather or suede with gentle tapping motions. This works especially well with fresh stains, but may not be effective with older, dried stains. Never use water on leather or suede. Fill a large bowl halfway full with lukewarm water, then add a squirt of mild liquid soap to the water. Swish the water around by shaking the bowl or by swirling your hand around in the water to create suds. Use your hands to scoop up the suds and bubbles you created, then add the suds to a clean sponge. Sponge the suds onto the stain and pat the stain gently. After you pat in the suds into the stain, use a dry paper towel or cloth to wipe the suds away from the fabric. You should see that the soap suds have worked to partially or completely remove the stain. If the stain is still visible in the leather or suede, sprinkle on enough cornmeal to lightly cover the stain. Let the cornmeal sit for about half an hour. Cornmeal works by lifting and absorbing the stain. After you have let the cornmeal sit for around half an hour, use a dry, stiff-bristled brush to delicately brush the cornmeal off of the leather or suede. If you see that some of the stain is still there, add on more cornmeal. Keep repeating until all the stain has been absorbed and removed."

      "Your regular physician is a good first step if you suspect you have mild depression. Some illnesses, especially those related to the thyroid or other parts of the body’s hormone system, cause depressive symptoms. Other medical conditions, especially terminal or chronic conditions, may carry also a risk for depressive symptoms. In these cases, your doctor can help you understand the source of your symptoms and how to alleviate them. Engaging in psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” can be very beneficial for treating mild depression. Depending on your specific needs, you might try to find a certain type of mental health professional, including counseling psychologists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, or licensed professional counselors. If you have mild depression, it’s likely you’d visit with a counselor first.   Counseling psychologists: Counseling psychologists focus on helping skills and helping people overcome difficult times in their lives. This type of therapy can be short- or long-term and is often problem-specific and goal-directed. Counselors ask questions and listen to what you have to say. The counselor will be an objective observer helping you to identify significant ideas and to discuss them in greater detail. This will help you work out emotional and environmental issues that may contribute to your depression.  Clinical psychologists: These psychologists are trained to administer tests to confirm a diagnosis and, therefore, tend to focus more psychopathology. Clinical psychologists are also trained to use a wide range of therapeutic techniques.  Psychiatrists: Psychiatrists may use psychotherapy and scales or tests in their practice. They are typically seen when medication is an option the patient wants to explore. In most states, only psychiatrists can prescribe medication. You may see more than one kind of therapist, depending on your needs. Cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy and behavioral psychotherapies consistently show benefits to patients.   Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): The goal of CBT is to challenge and change beliefs, attitudes and preconceptions thought to underlie depressive symptoms and effect change to maladaptive behaviors.  Interpersonal therapy (IPT): IPT focuses on life changes, social isolation, deficits in social skills and other interpersonal issues that may contribute to depressive symptoms. IPT may be particularly effective if a specific event, such as a death, triggered a recent depressive episode.  Behavioral therapies: These types of therapies aim to schedule enjoyable activities while minimizing unpleasant experiences through techniques such as activity scheduling, self-control therapy, social skills training and problem solving. Consider recommendations from friends or family, leaders in your religious community, community mental health center, your Employee Assistance Program (if your employer offers one), or contact your doctor for help finding a counselor. The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards provides basic information about how to choose a therapist, your state's licensure requirements and how to check whether someone is licensed. Other professional associations, such as the American Psychological Association, may provide search functions for locating practitioners in your area. Your visits with a counselor should be covered by your health insurance. Although mental illnesses are legally required to be covered to the same extent as physical illnesses, the type of insurance you have can still affect the type and amount of therapy you receive. Be sure to check with your insurance company so that you get any referrals needed before starting treatment and that you see someone who will accept your insurance and will be paid by your insurance company. Anti-depressants affect the neurotransmitter system of the brain to try to counteract problems in how neurotransmitters are made and/or used by the brain.  Some professionals feel that anti-depressants are over-prescribed and are not very effective for treating mild depression. Some studies show that anti-depressants are most effective for severe or chronic depression.  Medication can be a good method to improve your mood and help you benefit more fully from psychotherapy. For many people, short-term treatment with anti-depressants can help treat mild depression.",
      "When you don't sleep well, your defense mechanisms can be compromised. This can make it harder to handle the symptoms of mild depression. Try going to bed earlier than normal to ensure that you get 7-8 hours of sleep every night. Sleep is a restorative activity that allows your body to heal itself. If you aren't getting enough sleep, talk to your doctor. She might prescribe sleep medication. You might also try changing your sleeping times. The inability to get to enough sleep can indicate depressive symptoms. If you have trouble getting to sleep, try listening to calm music before bed. Turn off your computer and phone at least 30 minutes before bedtime to give your eyes and brain a rest from the screen. Exercise may be an underutilized method for boosting mood. Studies suggest that exercise helps to elevate mood and prevent relapse. Aim to get 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.  Set attainable goals for yourself. No matter how easy you think a goal is to attain, attaining it gives you the experience of success early and the confidence needed to set your next goal. Start with a goal of walking 10 minutes per day for a couple of days during the week, then push yourself to do more, such as walking for 10 minutes every day for one week; then every day for one month; then the whole year. See how long you can keep your streak going. The best part of exercise as a treatment for depression is that activities such as walking and running do not cost a lot of money. Before starting a new exercise routine, talk with your doctor and/or a personal trainer to determine the best exercises for your fitness level. Consider every exercise session as a treatment for your mood and a positive reflection of your will to improve. Light therapy, or exposing yourself to sunlight or light that mimics sunlight, can positively effect on your mood. Some research suggests that increased amounts of sunlight will increase your body’s levels of vitamin D.  Try a dawn simulator. This is a timer mechanism that you attach to a lamp in your bedroom. The lamp will start to light up gradually 30-45 minutes before your scheduled wake-up time. Your brain will think that morning light is coming through the window and you may trick your body into feeling better.  Get a light therapy box or lamp. This device emits simulated sunlight. Sit in front of a light therapy box for 30 minutes per day to get more light exposure. When you’re stressed, your body responds by releasing cortisol, a stress hormone. If you experience chronic stress, your body may overreact and not shut off the stress hormone release. Try to manage and reduce your stress so that your body has a chance to rejuvenate.   Try meditation to reduce stress. Make a list of the things that stress you out. Try to minimize the number of stressors in your life. Gardening, walking and other outdoor activities can create beneficial effects. Getting out into green spaces and nature can lift your mood and help you if you’re feeling the effects of mild depression. Gardening and digging in the dirt can also create positive affects, thanks to anti-depressant microbes in soil that increase serotonin levels. Some people feel the effects of depression because of repressed creativity. The link between depression and creativity has been of great interest because some think it may be “the cost” of being a creative person rather than being a “necessary evil” of creativity. Depression may arise when a creative person finds it difficult to find an expressive outlet.",
      "Depression symptoms can range from mild to moderate to severe. With mild depression, you may feel sad much of the time, or you might lack interest in activities that you once found enjoyable. In addition, mild depression will typically include a few (but usually not all) of the following symptoms:  Appetite loss or weight gain. Sleeping too much or too little. Increased agitation. Decreased movement. Low energy every day. Feeling worthless Feelings of inappropriate guilt. Difficulty concentrating. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) affects more people during the fall and winter months and may be caused by the body getting less sunlight. This may mean that the body produces less serotonin, a chemical that affects mood. Recognize the symptoms of SAD:  Increased need to sleep. Fatigue or reduced energy. Lack of concentration. Increased feeling of wanting to be alone. These symptoms typically subside in the spring and summer, but they can still produce mild depression in the winter. If you feel like you’ve got a case of the blues, it’s important to pay attention to your symptoms to determine if you’re becoming depressed. You may experience more frequent feelings or symptoms, or your symptoms may last for longer than 2 weeks. If you’re unsure about the progression of your symptoms, ask a trusted friend or family member for his/her opinion. Although your own experience and perspective is most important, it can be helpful to get someone else’s perspective on how you’re acting. A major traumatic life event, such as an unexpected death of a family member, can cause symptoms that resemble depression. But it may not be major depressive disorder. The context of the event and duration of symptoms may help, in part, to determine whether someone is experiencing grief or a major depressive disorder.  Feelings of worthlessness and thoughts of suicide are typically not present when in mourning. Positive memories of the deceased are possible during mourning and one may still gain pleasure from certain activities (for example, activities done as a tribute to the deceased). During mild depression, you may experience negative moods, negative thoughts, failure to gain pleasure from favorite activities or other symptoms. These symptoms may be present much of the time. When the change in mood during mourning distresses you and/or begins to affect your life, then you may be experiencing more than just a normal grieving process. Track your feelings and activities over a period of about two weeks. Jot down how you feel every day. Make a list of your activities. This list doesn’t need to be detailed; just write up a quick list so that you can identify patterns that emerge.  Keep track of how often you experience unprovoked bouts of crying. This might indicate more than mild depression.  If you have trouble keeping track of things, ask a trusted friend or family member to help you. This may be a sign that you’re more depressed than you initially suspected.",
      "Keeping a journal can be beneficial for understanding how your environment affects your mood, energy, health, sleep and so on. Journaling can also help you process your emotions and gain insight into why certain things make you feel a certain way. Even if you write only for a few minutes, it can be helpful to jot down your feelings and thoughts. Make it easy for yourself to write when the mood strikes. Consider using a simple note-taking application on your phone or tablet computer. Don’t feel like you need to write complete sentences if it’s easier for you to write phrases or bullet points. Don’t worry about spelling, grammar or style. Just write to get your thoughts out on paper. If you require more structure, you can seek out people who teach journaling; you can read books about journaling; or you can use websites to keep online journals. Use your journal however you want. You can keep everything private, share some things with friends, family or your therapist, or start a public blog.",
      "Acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese medicine that uses needles inserted at specific points on the body to correct energy blocks or imbalances.,  Find an acupuncture specialist in your area and try this procedure to determine if it helps reduce your symptoms of depression. One study shows a link between acupuncture and normalization of a neuroprotective protein called glial cell line derived-neurotrophic factor, and comparable effectiveness with fluoxetine (the generic name for Prozac).   Another study shows effectiveness comparable to psychotherapy. These studies lend some credibility to acupuncture as a treatment for depression, but more research is needed to support the effectiveness of acupuncture. St. John’s Wort is an alternative medicine that has been effective in small-scale studies, especially for milder forms of depression. If you are not taking SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), considering trying St. John's Wort.  In large-scale studies comparable to those needed for FDA approval, St. John’s Wort failed to be more effective than a placebo.  In addition, St. John’s Wort has not been shown to be more effective than available therapies (although it may offer reduced side effects). The American Psychiatric Association does not recommend St. John’s Wort for general use. Exercise caution when using St. John’s Wort. You should not use it with SSRIs or SNRIs because of the risk of serotonin syndrome. St. John's Wort can also make other drugs less effective when taken at the same time. Drugs that might be affected include oral contraceptives, anti-retroviral medications, anti-coagulants such as Warfarin, hormone replacement therapies and immunosuppressant medications. Talk with your doctor if you are on other medications. Follow dosing instructions when using St. John’s Wort. The National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine recommends caution in using homeopathic remedies and encourages open discussions with health care providers so that homeopathic treatment can be properly coordinated and yield safe results. An alternative medicine is S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe). SAMe is a naturally occurring molecule, and low levels of SAMe have been linked to depression.  SAMe can be taken orally, intravenously and intramuscularly. Follow dosing instructions on the supplement’s packaging. The preparation of SAMe is not regulated and the potency and ingredients can vary among manufacturers. Whether SAMe is superior to other available treatments has not been established. The National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine recommends caution in using homeopathic remedies and encourages open discussions with health care providers so that treatment can be properly coordinated and yield safe results.",
      "Sometimes it can be difficult to observe how your nutrition affects your mood since food's effect is not immediate. However, it is important to pay attention to what you eat and how it makes you feel to track your depression.  Eat foods that relate to fewer symptoms of depression, including fruit, vegetables, and fish.  Avoid foods that relate to more symptoms of depression, including processed foods such as processed meats, chocolates, sweet desserts, fried foods, processed cereals and high-fat dairy products. Dehydration can contribute to emotional and physical changes. Your mood can be negatively affected even by mild dehydration.  Drink plenty of water throughout the day, not just when you feel thirsty or when you exercise. Men should aim to drink about 13 eight-ounce servings of water per day, and women should drink 9 eight-ounce servings of water per day. People with depression may have low levels of certain brain chemicals, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fish oil capsules have omega-3 fatty acids and contain EPA and DHA. These can help alleviate some mild symptoms of depression. Take 3 grams or less per day. Higher doses of fish oil can prevent your blood from clotting, which can increase the chance of bleeding. Many people experiencing depression have a deficiency of folate, which is a B vitamin. Increase your folate levels by eating lots of spinach, nuts, beans, asparagus and Brussels sprouts."

      ". If you spend time around people who smoke, there's a good chance that they'll offer you a cigarette at some point. If you don't want to smoke, just say so, and most people will respect you for sticking to your principles. If anyone tries to pressure you into smoking, don't give them any consideration--just keep saying no, and they'll eventually stop bothering you.  If people don't respect your decision to avoid smoking, chances are that on some level they're jealous of your discipline. They may try to convince you to try it: \"One little cigarette won't kill you...\" If you're really interested in trying a cigarette, it's okay to experiment and figure out what you do and don't enjoy--but don't light one up just because you think people will judge you otherwise. Some people are able to smoke the occasional cigarette without letting the habit spiral into a full-blown, pack-a-day addiction, but it's hard to tell which type of smoker you'll be without actually dancing with addiction. If you have an addictive personality--if you have trouble controlling your consumption of things like soda, coffee, alcohol, or sweets--there's a good chance that this will extend to smoking. Sidestream smoke--the smoke that wafts from the burning tip of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar--has higher concentrations of toxic, cancer-causing agents (carcinogens) than the \"mainstream smoke\" that smokers inhale. Secondhand smoke can be nearly, if not equally, as bad for your health as smoking. What's more, if you're trying to quit, the sight of other people smoking might sorely tempt you. If you have friends or family who smoke, and you don't want to cut them out of your life, politely ask them to go outside or step away from you when they smoke. Constantly remind yourself how harmful a smoking habit can be, and you may find that the research reinforces your resolve to avoid smoking. Quitting smoking can add years to your life, and it greatly reduces your risk for various smoking-related diseases. Consider passing the information along to friends and loved ones who habitually smoke--but don't preach, merely aim to inform.  Cigarettes contain carcinogenic (cancer-causing) chemicals, and when you smoke, you inhale those chemicals directly into your body. Most cases of lung cancer stem from habitual smoking. Smoking causes strokes and coronary heart disease, which are the leading causes of death in the United States. Even people who smoke fewer than five cigarettes a day can show early signs of cardiovascular disease.  Smoking causes most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. If you have asthma, tobacco can trigger an attack and make your symptoms worse.",
      "Make a list of all the reasons you want to quit. This will help you clarify your decision to quit. Refer to this list whenever you're tempted to smoke.  Consider how smoking affects various important areas of your life: your health, your appearance, your lifestyle, and your loved ones. Ask yourself whether these areas would benefit from you quitting.  For example, your list might say something like: I want to quit smoking so I can run and keep up with my son during soccer practice, have more energy, be alive to see my youngest grandchild get married, and save money. Throw away your cigarettes. Wash your bedding and clothes to get rid of cigarette smells. Dispose of any ashtrays, cigarettes, and lighters that are hanging around your house. Make a commitment to yourself: you will not smoke another cigarette.  Remind yourself of your plan and carry a written version with you, or keep it on your phone. You may also want to re-read the list of reasons why you want to quit. If you aren't prepared to quit cold-turkey, consider tapering off gradually. Fewer cigarettes are still (somewhat) better for you than more cigarettes. Some people find that they can only quit if they do it all at once, but others have found success through a gradual taper. Be honest with yourself: what is going to work? Cigarettes are highly effective at delivering nicotine throughout your body. When you stop smoking, you might experience increased cravings, anxiety, depression, headaches, feeling tense or restless, increased appetite and weight gain, and problems concentrating.  Realize that it may take more than one attempt to stop smoking. About 45 million Americans use some form of nicotine, and only 5 percent of users are able to quit on their first try.  Try to avoid relapsing as much as possible. But if you do, recommit as soon as you can to quitting smoking. Learn from your experience and try to cope better in the future. If you have a relapse and smoke for an entire day, be sure to be gentle and forgiving with yourself. Accept that the day was tough, remind yourself that quitting is a long, hard journey, and get back on your plan the next day. Your family and friends can help you stick to your commitment. Let them know your goal, and ask them to help you by not smoking around you or offering you a cigarette. Ask for their support and encouragement. Ask them to remind you of your specific goals when temptation is difficult. Many people find that certain situations trigger the desire to smoke. You might want a cigarette with your cup of coffee, for instance, or you might want to smoke when you're trying to solve a problem at work. Identify places where it may be difficult not to smoke, and have a plan for what you'll do in those specific places. If possible, avoid those places.  Practice an automatic response for a cigarette offer: “No thank you, but I will have another tea” or “No thanks–I'm trying to quit.” Control stress. Stress can be a pitfall when trying to quit smoking. Use techniques such as deep breathing, exercise, and down time to help thwart stress. Make sure to get plenty of sleep, since this will help lower your stress. There are various iPhone and Android apps that are designed specifically to keep you from smoking. These apps provide a platform to help you track your cravings and moods, identify your smoking triggers, record your progress toward achieving your goals, and stay strong in stressful times. Search for \"quit-smoking apps\", read descriptions and reviews, and choose a program that meets your needs. Recent studies have suggested that using e-cigarettes while you quit smoking can help you reduce or quit smoking. Other studies recommend caution when using e-cigarettes since the amount of nicotine varies, the same chemicals as those in cigarettes are still being delivered, and they may re-activate the habit of smoking. Behavioral therapy combined with medication therapy can improve your chances of successfully quitting. If you've tried quitting on your own and are still struggling, think about getting professional help. Your doctor can talk to you about medication therapy. Therapists can also help you through the process of quitting. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy can help change your thoughts and attitudes about smoking. Therapists can also teach coping skills or new ways to think about quitting. This medication doesn't actually have nicotine, but it does help reduce the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Bupropion could increase your chances of staying away from cigarettes by 69 percent.  Usually, you'll want to start taking bupropion 1 to 2 weeks before you stop smoking. It's normally prescribed in one or two 150mg tablets per day. Side effects include: dry mouth, difficulty sleeping, agitation, irritability, tiredness, indigestion and headaches. This medication curbs nicotine receptors in the brain, which makes smoking less pleasurable. It also reduces withdrawal symptoms. You should start taking Chantix one week before quitting. Be sure to take it with meals. Take Chantix for 12 weeks, and it could double your chances of quitting.  Your doctor will have you increase your dose over time. For example, you'll take one 0.5mg pill for days 1-3. Then you'll take one 0.5mg pill twice a day for days 4-7. You'll take one 1 mg pill twice per day after that. Side effects include: headaches, nausea, vomiting, trouble sleeping, unusual dreams, gas, and changes in taste. NRT includes all types of patches, gums, lozenges, nasal sprays, inhalers, or sublingual tablets that deliver nicotine into the body. You don't need a prescription for NRT and it can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. NRT could increase your chances of quitting by 60 percent. Side effects of NRT include: nightmares, insomnia, and skin irritation for patches; mouth soreness, difficult breathing, hiccups, and jaw pain for gum; mouth and throat irritation and coughing for nicotine inhalers; throat irritation and hiccups for nicotine lozenge; and throat and nasal irritation as well as runny nose if the nasal spray is used.",
      "Whether you're trying to quit smoking, or trying to keep from developing a habit, you might need to ask a parent or sibling, a teacher, or a non-smoking friend to help keep you in check. Ask this person to keep an eye on you and tell you if you're engaging in dangerous behavior. Ask if you can message or call this person in the event that you're having trouble resisting peer pressure. Don't be afraid to actually use this resource: smoking is highly addictive, and you might need all the help that you can get. If you are really serious about avoiding a smoking habit, then you might want to avoid people who habitually smoke. You can always keep saying no, but you will still run the risk of inhaling secondhand smoke as long as you spend time with smokers. If you don't want to cut these people out of your life, try stepping away from them when they smoke--or asking them to take their cigarettes outside.  When you breathe secondhand smoke, you ingest all of the toxic, cancer-causing chemicals that waft into the air when cigarettes burn. You can inhale secondhand smoke by breathing \"mainstream smoke\" (the smoke that smokers exhale) as well as \"sidestream smoke\" (the smoke from the lighted end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar).  If you get used to being around people that smoke, you may gradually lighten up your attitude toward smoking--and you may be more likely to relapse. If you're constantly listening to people tell you that smoking is okay, your perspective may begin to sway. It isn't easy to leave friends behind, but it may be the right choice if you want to put your health first. Be honest with your friends. Say, \"I'm not comfortable with you guys pressuring me to smoke, and I'm afraid that if I keep hanging out with you I might actually start smoking. I'm going to take some time to get my priorities straight.\" Get rid of any un-smoked cigarettes that you own, and don't buy any new cigarettes.  As long as you keep cigarettes around, you are acknowledging that smoking is a possibility. When you get rid of your cigarettes, you go a long way toward removing yourself from the possibility, and you make smoking much easier to avoid.  It may be tempting to tell yourself, \"I'll just smoke the rest of this pack, so that it doesn't go to waste, and then I won't buy any more. I'll quit once I finish these cigarettes.\" Some people may be able to follow through with this sort of plan, but it's safest not to tempt yourself. The \"just one more pack\" mentality can stretch into years of continued smoking. You can throw the whole pack away for dramatic effect, or you can give the cigarettes away to someone else if you're uncomfortable with the waste. The important thing is that you get the smokes away from yourself as soon as possible. Develop habits and hobbies that reinforce your commitment to avoiding smoking, and try to involve yourself in communities that actively discourage smoking. Whenever you get the urge to smoke, channel that energy into something else: go to the gym, or pick up an instrument, or take a walk to clear your head. It's easy to let smoking a cigarette become your first impulse--so try to break this habit.  Build a regular exercise routine, whether you're running, hiking, playing sports, or going to the gym. The more work you put into your health and physical fitness, the less likely you will be to want to tear it down. Join a hiking group, a sports team, or any group of active, outdoorsy people. Many active  groups hold a stigma against smoking, especially during the group activities--so you can use this stigma to keep yourself from getting tempted to smoke."

      "Turn off the power that controls your chandelier. Wait to do any work until the light bulbs on your fixture feel cool to the touch. You do not need to disconnect the electricity, but you may as an extra precaution since this step involves disassembling the fixture. Disconnect power from the room only if you are confident in operating your home’s circuit breaker or have assistance from a knowledgeable electrician. You should not need to adjust any electric wiring in this process. While you’re waiting for the bulbs to cool, prepare your workspace. Place a thick blanket on the floor under your chandelier, as well as across a nearby table or whatever surface you plan to place chandelier parts on. Set up a stepladder or taller ladder securely under the chandelier.  A heavy, thick blanket or cloth is essential for underneath your workspace, as it will soften the landing and prevent breakage in the case of pieces falling during disassembly. If you don’t have one, fold over another cloth several times to make it thicker.  Make sure your ladder is at a height that is comfortable to reach all parts of the chandelier.  Inspect your chandelier and take photos from several different angles and distances so you will remember how to reassemble it later. Carefully remove each crystal from the chandelier and place it on a nearby surface that is stable and covered with a blanket or thick cloth.  You may disassemble other larger parts of the chandelier or take down the whole fixture entirely if it is possible to do so safely and without affecting wiring or the fragile parts of the chandelier. You may need needle-nose pliers or a similar tool to unfasten each crystal piece, depending on your chandelier. You can also use them to reshape the crystal fasteners during reassembly to strengthen them. Fill a sink with warm water and a small amount of mild dish soap. Line the sink with a cloth or towel to provide padding. Place crystals into the padded sink and rub each one separately with your fingers in the soapy water before rinsing and placing on a soft, clean towel.  Take care to prevent crystals from hitting against each other or against hard surfaces of the sink to avoid cracking or chipping. There is no need to use a sponge or brush to clean crystals with the soapy water, and in fact this could end up scratching them. Dry the crystals with a soft, absorbent cloth immediately after rinsing. This is essential to preventing dried water spots from forming. If you need to, clean the frame, bulbs, and any other parts of the chandelier with a soft, dry cloth. Replace bulbs if they are dim, broken, or discolored.  You may be able to use the same soapy water or other cleaner on the frame or other parts of the chandelier. Check first about the variety of metal or other material they’re made out of to find the right cleaner for it. Be sure to thoroughly dry any moisture that has remained in light bulb sockets or other areas of electrical connection. Dry as best you can with a cloth, then leave parts out to dry further for several hours before assembly if necessary. Work from your photos or memory to replace all parts, bulbs, and crystals to where they belong in the fixture. While assembling, work from the top down and from inside to out to put all the pieces back together easily.",
      "Aim to clean your chandelier with either the “crystals on” or “crystals off” method every year for a fixture that remains shining and bright.  Observe your chandelier periodically for visible dust, cloudy crystals, or spots. These are all indications that you should clean your fixture right away. Clean more often if your chandelier is located in a kitchen, as it will build up more grease and grime than in other areas of the house. Entryways are another area in which a chandelier may need more frequent cleaning. If you’ve never cleaned your chandelier, opt for a deep clean by performing the “crystals off” method. Otherwise, the less time-intensive “crystals on” method will typically suffice for regular cleaning. Choose a deeper clean particularly if there are stubborn spots or a cloudy, milky quality to the crystal that isn’t removed by a simple dusting. To make your clean last longer, use a soft feather or lambswool duster to lightly clear dust from the frame and crystals. You'll need a stepladder, but you do not need to disassemble the fixture.  A good general rule is to dust every few months, or whenever you notice a visible layer of dust or haziness on the crystals, frame, or bulbs. It’s also a good idea to dust before any wet cleaning, as you can remove larger dust and dirt particles ahead of time.",
      "Switch off the light switch that controls the power for your chandelier. Wait until the light bulbs on your fixture feel cool to the touch. You can disconnect the electricity as an extra precaution, but only do this if you are confident in operating your home’s circuit breaker or have assistance from a knowledgeable electrician. You should not need to adjust any electric wiring in this process. While you’re waiting for the bulbs to cool, prepare your workspace. Place a tarp or drop cloth over the floor under your chandelier, and set up a stepladder or taller ladder securely under the chandelier.  To prevent any parts dropping and breaking, you can lay down a thick blanket to absorb the fall. Make sure your ladder is at a height that is comfortable to reach all parts of the chandelier. Working on your ladder where you can reach the chandelier, spray a glass cleaner or specific chandelier cleaner on a cotton cloth that is clean and soft. Wipe down each crystal with the damp cloth, then immediately dry with a separate dry cloth.  Try wearing an apron with pockets while you work, so that you can keep the cleaner, cloths, and any other supplies easily on hand.  Instead of two cloths, you can wear two soft cotton gloves for better control and dexterity. Spray one glove with the cleaner to wipe crystals down, and keep the other glove clean to dry them. If you have a lot of crystals, you may want several pairs of gloves. Work your way around the chandelier to clean every crystal with your cleaner and cloth, wiping with the damp cloth or glove and drying with the clean one.  When cleaning the crystals, always spray cleaner onto a cloth first, rather than directly onto the fixture. While cleaning, don’t twist or rotate the chandelier to access each side or part. This could damage or weaken its parts or supports, risking falling and breakage. Instead, carefully descend and move the ladder to position yourself in the right spot to reach and clean each part separately. Wipe the frame and any other parts of your chandelier with just a dry cloth or an appropriate chandelier cleaner or metal cleaner.  Ensure that you use a cleaner that is intended for the type of metal or other material that your chandelier frame is made out of, otherwise you run the risk of discoloring or tarnishing it. Clean any metal hooks or fasteners for the crystals with a dry cloth only, as cleaner can tarnish or strip the finish off of them. Clean off the light bulbs in your fixture with a clean, dry cloth. Make sure that all bulbs are screwed in properly and don’t appear browned or discolored.  If any light bulbs are dim, burnt out, broken, or missing, take this opportunity to change them out with new bulbs of proper wattage.  If a bulb appears to have more stubborn stains, you can very gently clean it with a cloth damp with cleaner, or replace the bulb entirely."

This is fine. In “Murder in the Dark”, holding a certain card means you will play a certain role in the game.  The person who is dealt the Ace is the murderer. The person who is dealt the King is the police officer. The person who is dealt the Jack is the detective. If the person who has the Jack “dies”, the person who has the King becomes the detective. If the person(s) who have the Jack or the King both “die”, the person who has the Queen becomes the detective. However, remind everyone that they should keep whichever cards they have secret so no one knows who is the murderer, the police officer, or the detective.",

      "You don’t want to bump into anything that will injury you when you’re walking around in the dark! Instruct the players to walk carefully around the room and avoid sticking together or huddling in one area. ' The murderer will go around the room, find someone, and tap them on the shoulder to let them know they are now a victim.  The murderer can also whisper quietly \"you're dead\" to the victim. Alternatively, the murderer could clamp their hand over the person’s mouth to prevent the person from screaming, and then whisper \"you're dead\". The ‘victims’ can fall down dramatically or make dramatic dying noises. Try to be as dramatic and silly as possible. ” once you come across someone who has been murdered. As soon as someone says this, the player closest to the lights should turn them on.  If a player sees someone standing silently alone, they can ask them, \"Are you dead?\" The player should simply indicate yes or no, but they must tell the truth so it is clear whether or not you can yell out “Murder in the Dark!” One trick the murderer could try is hiding the person they just killed in a hiding place in the room or in another room. If the murderer successfully hides the people they “kill”, it will take longer for someone to discover the victims and allow them to “kill” people longer. However, this tactic could allow the murderer to get caught more easily as they are distracted with dealing with the “bodies”. Vote on whether the murderer is allowed to use this tactic as a house rule before you start the game. Any players who are not present should be noted as dead. As an extra to the game, you could try to find all the dead players in their hiding places and bring them into the room. This step in the game could be as simple as one guess or as complicated as a question and answer session where the detective tries to solve the murder.  The role of the police officer is to enforce order while the detective tries to solve the murder. If you decide to do a pretend Q&A, have the detective sit in a chair in front of everyone and ask questions to all the alive players, such as: Where were you when someone yelled “Murder in the Dark”? Who do you think is the murderer and why? Once the detective has gathered enough information and decided who they suspect is the murderer, they say: “final accusation” and ask their suspect, “Are you the murderer?” If the detective guesses who the murderer is successfully, they win the game. But if they guess incorrectly, the murderer wins the game.  If the detective is killed by the murderer during the killing spree in the dark, they can be replaced by whoever had the King card.

A spiral or slice of rind is the most common citrus garnish, but wedges are used occasionally. The most common citrus fruits to use are lemon, lime, and orange. However, feel free to experiment with something bitter, like grapefruit. Hold the fruit in your non-dominant hand and the knife in your dominant hand. Press the tip of the knife into the top of the fruit. Gently slide the knife down the fruit until you reach the bottom. Make another cut about ½ inch (12.7 mm) from that. Pull the wedge out of the fruit.  Always use caution with sharp knives so you don’t cut yourself. Cut a larger wedge if you want, but keep in mind that a larger slice adds more tartness. Squeeze a bit of the juice into the drink and then set the wedge in the glass. With a sharp knife, slice off a thin spiral from around the citrus fruit. Make sure you don’t cut into the pith, the white spongy part, of the fruit, because that will impart a bitter taste. Cut the spiral strip about ¼ inch (6.35 mm) thick and four to six inches (10 to 15 cm) long.  Another option is to cut an oval slice off of the citrus rind. Still be sure not to cut so deep into the fruit that you include the pith. Using a peeler rather than a knife is a faster option if you have one. Make sure that one end rests inside the drink to impart some essential oils into the drink. Alternatively, you can gently drop the rind into the drink and let it float on the surface. Gently squeeze the oval slice or the strip to add a few drops of pure citrus oil into the drink. You’ll see the oil floating on top of the drink.",
      "Olives are a classic martini garnish. Traditional olives to use include Spanish Queen and Green Barouni olives. Black olives are an option, but only use them for a non-traditional martini recipe.  It’s your choice to use olives with or without seeds and with or without something extra stuffed in them. You don’t have to go out of your way to get fancy olives. The basic ones you’d find at the grocery work just fine. Don’t add olives to fruity martinis because the tastes won’t mix well. Olives usually come in a jar in a pickle or brine liquid. A dirty martini leaves that brine on the olive, and sometimes adds an extra splash of brine. If you’re not making a dirty martini, be sure to rinse off the olives with water before adding them to the drink.  Briefly run the olives under some cold water to rinse them. You don’t need to wash them for a long time. If you are making drinks in your home or with friends, ask if they want the olives rinsed or with the brine left on them. If you have small skewers, stick one through one or more olives and place it in the drink. If you don’t have those, wooden toothpicks work, as well. Otherwise, drop the olives directly into the drink.  This is more about the drinker’s preference. Some people want to briefly add the olive taste to the drink and then remove the olives. That’s when skewers come in handy. Another option is to lay the skewer across the glass so the olives just barely touch the top of the drink. If you’d like to add some different flavors to your martini, select olives stuffed with a variety of other foods. Pimento is the most common stuffing, and is easy to find. For something more exotic, get olives stuffed with almonds, garlic, or cheese. If you are making the drink for someone else, it’s good to mention what type of olives you have so they can decide if they want that or not.",
      "When garnished with onion, a martini is called a Gibson martini. Use small pearl onions, which are often marketed for cocktails. They usually come in a jar and are often pickled in brine. If you’re in a pinch, try garnishing with a slice of regular white or sweet onion, but remember that it might not quite give you the taste you are hoping for. Onions are sometimes pickled with paprika or turmeric, along with the pickling brine. If you have onions that are adding too much of the wrong kind of flavor to your drink, rinse them off quickly with cold water. Keep in mind that rinsing them will take away some of the flavor, so only do it if you feel it’s absolutely necessary. You have the choice to skewer the onions or place them directly in the drink. Ask the drinker which they prefer. Rest the toothpick against the side of the cocktail glass when you serve the drink. The skewer is convenient because it allows the drinker to easily pull the onion out of the drink if they want to eat it.",
      "Sweet fruits like cherries are not typically used in traditional martinis. If you have a sour apple martini or a white chocolate martini, cherries add a nice syrupy sweetness, as well as brighten the color for a festive drink. Plop two or three cherries into the drink, or skewer them and lean them against the side of the glass. Apples are a great garnish for appletinis or other fruity martinis. Granny Smith apples add tartness rather than sweetness, so they are the most commonly used. Cut slices or cubes to garnish the drink with. Place them in a container with some lemon juice to keep them fresh if you cut them before you are ready to use them. If you want to try something even less common, add a sliver or whole pepper to the drink. Pickled pepperoncini or jalapeno are common peppers to use. Remember that both are pretty spicy, so add a small piece for just a hint of spice."

      "Adding powdered peanut butter to a smoothie or shake will add a peanut flavor while also adding essential protein to your shakes. To use the powder, add 1 tbsp (6.14 grams) of powdered peanut butter for every cup (250 milliliters) of smoothie or shake that you have. Make sure to blend it together so that the powder is no longer gritty and enjoy a low-fat but protein-rich drink. Powdered peanut butter tastes great in banana smoothies. Powdered peanut butter will break down in yogurt more easily than the creamy variation and will alter the texture of your yogurt less. Add a tablespoon (6.14 grams) of powdered peanut butter to a half cup (122.5 grams) of yogurt. Mix it together until the yogurt is smooth and eat it. Experiment with different amounts of powdered peanut butter and add an amount that suits your tastes. Adding peanut powder to your granola adds more of a nutty and sweet taste to it. Simply sprinkle a pinch of peanut butter powder over your granola and stir it in. Add more or less depending on your preferences. Avoid adding it to chocolate granola because it may muddle the flavors and create a bad taste. You can replace up to 1/3 of your pancake or waffle mix with powdered peanut butter. Not only will the powder add a peanut taste to your breakfast, but it'll also pack protein in your waffles or pancakes as well. Mix your pancake mix as you normally would, but replace 1/3 of the total amount of mix with powdered peanut butter instead.",
      "If you're looking to reduce the fat in your favorite recipes, you can use powdered peanut butter instead of the creamy variety. Simply replace the peanut butter that a recipe is calling for with reconstituted peanut butter.  Keep in mind that the texture of powdered peanut butter is different, and it will translate to the texture of your food. When measuring the powder, keep in mind that 2 tablespoons (6.14 grams) of powder will create 1 tablespoon (6.14 grams) of peanut butter. You can use the powder in baked goods like brownies, cookies, and muffins. When making 12 servings of brownies, for instance, use 1 cup (294.7 grams) of powdered peanut butter as a replacement for flour in the recipe.  You can also create peanut butter cookies, replacing flour with the powdered peanut butter and fruit puree, like applesauce. Use a half a cup (147.36 grams) of powdered peanut butter with a half a cup (60 grams) of flour to creating your powder coating. Add in spices like salt and pepper and sift the coating thoroughly. Once it's mixed, you can coat your proteins with the flour and the peanut butter mixture. After you're done coating your meat, fry or bake your food as you normally would. This will impart a subtle peanut butter taste to your coating.  This recipe is especially good with poultry. You may need to dredge your protein in an eggwash to better bind the coating to your meat. To create a frosting using powdered peanut butter, combine 1 cup (227 g) of softened butter with 1/2 cup (147.36 grams) of powdered peanut butter, 3 cups (600 grams) of sugar, and 3 tablespoons (44.36 mL) of milk or almond milk and beat the ingredients together with a food processor or mixer until they are light and fluffy. You can create a Thai-inspired sauce using powdered peanut butter. To create the sauce, combine 1/4 cup of powdered peanut butter with 2 tbsp light coconut milk and 2 tbsp of soy sauce. The finished result will taste salty and sweet.  This sauce can be used as a dipping sauce for appetizers like dumplings. You can also use it as a salad dressing.",
      "Use a scale or measuring spoons to measure the powdered peanut butter. Level off the tablespoon and dump four of them into a dry mixing bowl. This will be the bowl you'll use to mix your powder into creamy peanut butter. Measure out 2 tbsp (14.78 mL) of water from the faucet, or you can use distilled water from a bottle. Pour the water into the mixing bowl on top of the powder. The water will pool on top of the powdered peanut butter until you mix it. 4 tbsp (24.56 grams) of powdered peanut butter will make 2 tsp (12.28 grams) of spreadable peanut butter. Powdered peanut butter will come out to be more gritty in texture to its spreadable counterpart. If your peanut butter is too thick, you can add more water. Once you finish the reconstituting process, the peanut butter should be ready to eat. Powdered peanut butter in powder form has a shelf life up to 10-12 months unopened. After you reconstitute your peanut butter, however, you must refrigerate it, and it goes bad in 48 hours.  Try to reconstitute the peanut butter as you eat it so that it tastes fresh each time."

      "At this length, even the smallest amount of regrowth will be obvious, so you will need to trim your hair more often than you regularly would. Because of how often you have to trim it, it would be a good idea to invest in a trimmer and learning how to buzz your own hair. If your hair grows slowly, then you may be able to go 3-4 weeks between haircuts. Again, at this length, even the slightest amount of regrowth becomes visible. Unless you don't mind the frosted-tips look, you will need to redo the entire coloring process on your hair. This includes bleaching and toning as well. Bleaching will damage your hair, but at this length, it won't be as noticeable. Plus, you will eventually buzz it off. This will not only keep your color from fading, but it will also protect your scalp from getting sunburned. If you don't like to wear hats, try a hood or scarf instead. You can also apply some sunscreen or UV protection spray. A hat, scarf, or hood will help keep the color from fading the best. This is the key to keeping your color bright and vibrant. Wash your hair with the coldest temperature you can withstand, and be sure to use shampoo and conditioner formulated for color-treated hair.  Limit yourself to washing your hair only once or twice per week. If you do need to wash your hair between then, stick to plain water. If you can't find products made for color-treated hair, use sulfate-free products instead. Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents that can cause hair dye to fade. When you trim your buzz cut, you'll likely end up cutting all of the dyed portions off and starting with virgin hair. This is a perfect opportunity to wash your scalp with a scalp cleansing shampoo, such as an anti-dandruff or scalp balancing shampoo.  If possible, use sulfate-free shampoo; sulfates can contribute to dryness. Don't wash your hair with scalp cleansing shampoo while it is still dyed, as the shampoo may remove the color. Consider using a scrub on your hair during this time as well. This will help remove the dead skin cells from our scalp.",
      "This will determine whether or not you need to bleach it first. If you are going for a darker shade than your own, you do not need to bleach your hair and can go right on to the dyeing portion. If you are going a lighter shade, however, you will need to bleach first.  If you have light hair and are dyeing it darker, click here to continue. If your hair is blonde and you are dyeing it a cool color, like purple or blue, it may be a good idea to tone your hair first. Click here to learn more. Put on an old shirt you won't mind staining, then cover your shoulders with an old towel. Lay down some newspaper across your counter. If you want to, you can pull on a pair of plastic dyeing gloves as well. The bleach will be coming into contact with your scalp anyway, so the gloves are not absolutely necessary. Get a packet of hair bleach and 20 volume developer. Measure out 1 part bleach and 2 parts 20 volume developer. Mix the two together in a non-metal bowl with a non-metal spoon.  Prepare enough bleach to saturate your hair. Some bleach kits come with a little scoop. Use that to measure the bleach and developer. If you're wearing gloves, you can apply the bleach with your hands. Alternatively, use a tinting brush. Don't worry about being too meticulous here. Simply apply a light, even coat of bleach, then wait 15 minutes. The goal is to cover as much of your hair as quickly as possible.  This initial coat of bleach will ensure that your hair lightens evenly. Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap to protect your surroundings. If you have very light hair, you may only need to wait 5 to 10 minutes. Once you notice your hair starting to lighten, you're ready for the second coat of bleach. Do not rinse the bleach out. Simply take the shower cap off (if you put it on earlier), and apply a thick, generous coat of bleach. Use enough so that you can't see a single strand of hair sticking out of the bleach. Once you have it in, wait up to 30 minutes for the bleach to process.  Again, cover your hair with a plastic shower cap while the bleach processes. If you have light-colored hair to begin with, you may not need to wait the full 30 minutes. If you like the level of lightness your hair reaches, you are done! Rinse the bleach out with cool water first, then use some shampoo. You haven't dyed your hair yet, so you can use any type of shampoo you want. A mild, moisturizing shampoo would be the best, however, because it will make your hair feel nice and soft. It's a good idea to use a purple or blue shampoo after you bleach your hair. This will help tone down any brassy, yellow, or orange tints that remain in your hair.",
      "Put on an old shirt and drape an old towel over your shoulders. Cover your counter with newspaper and pull on a pair of plastic dyeing gloves. There is no need to apply petroleum jelly to your hairline, neck, or ears; it will only make the job messier. It would be best if you wait 1 to 2 days before dyeing your hair to minimize damage. However, because your hair is so short, the damage won't be very noticeable. There are lots of different dyes available on the market. Most punk dyes come already mixed into developer and are ready to use straight from the jar. Other types of dyes need to be mixed into a 20 volume developer. You can even used a boxed dye kit.  If you got a pre-mixed dye and it is too dark, mix a small amount of the dye into white conditioner. Use enough conditioner to saturate your hair.  Always prepare the dye in a non-metal bowl. Use a non-metal spoon to stir it. Start from the top of your head and work your way towards the back. Do your front hairline and the sides next. When you reach your ears, pull them forward so that you can get the hairs behind them.  Use the edge of the brush to do your hairline. Don't worry if you get dye on your skin; it will come off. Turn your back to the mirror, and hold a smaller mirror in front of you so that you can check your work in the back of your head. How long you let the dye process depends on the type of dye that you are using. Most pre-mixed punk dyes need 45 minutes while boxed kits need only 20 minutes. Check the label or instructions that came with your dye. The plastic shower cap is not absolutely necessary, but it will help keep your surroundings clean. It also traps your body heat, which helps the dye process more effectively. Do not use any shampoo, as this may cause the dye to fade. Simply rinse the dye out with cool to lukewarm water. Once the water runs clear, apply conditioner to your hair. Wait 2 to 3 minutes, then rinse the conditioner out.  Use a sulfate-free conditioner made for color-treated hair. If you are using a boxed dye kit, there may already be a packet of conditioner for you to use. Most of the dye on your skin should have come out during your shower. If it didn't, use a cotton ball soaked in an alcohol-based makeup remover to wipe it off.",
      "Dye is translucent, so it only adds to whatever color is already there. Take a look at your hair and note the color. Is it silver, yellow, or brassy? Next, take a look at the color you are going to dye it. Will this color mix well with your current hair color? If not, you need to tone! For example:  Warm colors, like warm pink and peach already have orange in them, so if your hair came out brassy, you don't need to tone it. Cool colors, such as cool pink, purple, and blue need a silver base. If your hair came out brassy or yellow, you'll have to tone it. Some colors mix well with yellow because they already contain yellow--such as green or orange. In this case, you don't need to tone it. Toner has a small amount of dye in it, which is what helps cancel out the yellow or orange tones in your hair. As such, it will stain clothing, skin, and hair. Put on an old shirt you don't mind getting dirty, or drape an old towel around your shoulders. Cover your counter with newspaper and pull on a pair of plastic dyeing gloves. There is no need to apply petroleum jelly to the skin around your hairline, ears, and neck. Purchase a bottle of toner and some 20 volume developer. Mix the two together following the proportions recommended on the toner. As with bleach and dye, use a non-metal bowl and non-metal spoon.  If you can't find a toner, you can use a toning shampoo instead. If you can't find either, add a tiny amount of purple dye to white conditioner instead. You can do this with your gloved hands or with a tinting brush. Be sure to apply the toner liberally to your hair so that it coats every strand. If you don't do this, your hair won't tone evenly, which could result in an inconsistent dye job. Cover your head with a plastic shower cap. This will help keep your surroundings clean during the next step. How long you wait depends on the type of toner that you are using and the amount of toning that you require. In most cases, expect to wait around 10 to 15 minutes. Once the time is up, hop into the shower and wash the toner out using cool water. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. If you need to, use some sulfate-free shampoo meant for color-treated hair. If you left the toner on for too long, your hair may come out purple. Unless you are dyeing your hair purple, you may want to bleach these purple tints out. Dry your hair completely first, then apply bleach to it. Leave it on for 2 to 3 minutes, then wash it out with shampoo.  Prepare your bleach using 1 part bleach and 2 parts 20 volume developer. Apply the bleach with a tinting brush for more precision. You may not have to touch up all of your hair. While not absolutely necessary, this will help make your hair nice and soft. If you plan on dyeing your hair, then you might want to hold off on the mask for now. If you are leaving it silver or white, however, then take a moment to apply a deep conditioning mask.  Make sure that you use a sulfate-free mask. Check the ingredients label to be sure. Cover your head with a plastic shower cap to help make the mask more effective. You can use the same shower cap that you used previously, but make sure it's clean!"

      "If your muscles are sore from intense activities such as weightlifting, your muscles are rebuilding themselves, needing water and lots of protein. For optimal muscle growth, consume 1 gram (0.035 oz) of protein per day for every pound of lean body mass that you have, or, consume 0.22% of your lean body mass in protein.  For example, a man who weighs 150 pounds (68 kg) with 20% body fat, has 120 pounds (54 kg) of lean mass, and should consume 120 grams (4.2 oz) of protein per day. This will speed up recovery times considerably, as well as prevent muscle loss from poor nutrition. Eat Protein 15 to 45 minutes after workout for best results. Drink lots of water while you workout and throughout the day. Your muscles need water to function at their peak, and your body needs water to repair your muscles. Don't forget to drink water. Eating carbohydrates before and after your workout aids in muscle recovery and gives you the fuel necessary to power through your routine. Muscles need particular vitamins and minerals to repair properly as you work out, so prepping the body with the right supplements will help prepare it for strenuous exercise.  Vitamin C and antioxidants, in particular, have been effective in helping to prevent muscle soreness. Blueberries, artichokes, and green tea are antioxidant-rich, while chili peppers, guavas, and citrus fruits are all high in vitamin C.  Look into supplementing with branched-chain amino acids (bcaa: L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine) and others before exercise — such as l-glutamine, l-arginine, betaine, and taurine -- may help prepare to clear waste products from your muscles. This also may promote recovery and protein turnover, rebuilding muscle. Consider adding a protein supplement. Protein helps rebuild the muscles. You can try eating more natural sources of protein (like eggs, yoghurt, or chicken) or consider adding a scoop of protein powder in your post-workout smoothie.  Consider adding creatine to your diet. Creatine is an amino acid that occurs naturally in the body, but adding more creatine to your diet can help your muscles repair themselves more quickly after an intense workout. Creatine supplements are available at health food stores. Sour cherry juice is quickly becoming recognized as a superfood, known for its antioxidants and other benefits. In one study, scientists found that tart cherry juice provided relief for mild to moderate muscle soreness.  You can find 100% tart cherry juice at most major grocery stores or health food stores. Look for a brand that does not mix the juice with another type (for instance, cherry-apple juice), as those brands tend to put in a minimum amount of cherry. Also, be sure that the juice does not contain any added sugar or other ingredients. Try using tart cherry juice as the basis for a post-workout smoothie, or drink it on its own. It's great straight out of the freezer or place a plastic cup of cherry juice in the freezer for about 45 minutes to create a delicious cherry slushie.",
      "For your muscles to be limber and avoid injury during intense exercise, you must ease into your routine which gives them time to become warm and pliable. Avoid jumping right into a heavy or intense workout routine. Start with light exercises and gradually increase the intensity. For example, if you are weightlifting, don't start with your heavy weights: begin with easy repetitions of light hand weights before you begin intense bench presses. Stretching at the start and end of your workout will also help to get the lactic acid out of your muscles. Waiting hours after a strenuous workout before stretching is not the best. Stretch soon after activity that may cause soreness to prevent becoming stiff. Be sure that you stretch after warming up, as your muscles will be more limber and less likely to become injured by stretching. Check out this helpful wikiHow article for advice on how to stretch properly to increase flexibility and reduce your risk of injury. Dehydration at the start of an exercise routine or sport is dangerous not only because it can cause you to become light-headed and faint, but also because it can lead to muscle soreness afterwards. Proper hydration during intense physical exercise increases oxygen to your muscles, which gives your muscles more stamina and also aids in their recovery as you work out.  Try not to load up on water directly before you exercise, which can cause bloating and cramping. Instead, stay well-hydrated all the time, but especially in the 24 to 48 hours leading up to an intense workout.  The rule of thumb for drinking water is to drink half of your body weight in fluid ounces, or about 3% of your body weight, of water per day.So, if you weigh 128 lbs, you should consume 64 fluid ounces (8 cups) of water per day. If you weigh 100 kg, you should consume 3 litres of water per day. Be sure to stay well hydrated during your exercise routine: a good rule of thumb is to drink one cup (8 oz, 250 ml) of water for every 15 minutes of intense exercise.",
      "Ice-cold water immediately after an intense muscle workout has been shown to reduce muscle soreness more than any other single treatment. It reduces muscle inflammation and prevents much of the soreness from lingering in your muscles.  If you are a professional or college athlete or workout at an elite gym, you might have an ice bath there that you can utilise to help reduce muscle soreness. If not, try these strategies instead:  Jump into a cold shower or bath. The colder, the better: professional athletes use ice water, but if you can't stand it, just use cold tap water with no hot water added. It won't work as well as ice water, but it will be better than warm or lukewarm water. If you're an athlete, consider investing in a five-gallon bucket. For soreness of the arms (like from baseball practice), a five-gallon bucket filled with ice water will allow you to ice the whole arm at one time. This method will also work for feet. When icing a muscle or muscle group (rather than your whole body), make sure wrap an ice pack in some sort of buffer before applying the ice. This will keep the extreme cold from injuring your skin. Try putting crushed ice in a plastic bag, then wrapping it in a tea towel or washcloth before applying to the affected muscles.  Use plastic wrap to secure ice to limbs or the body. If you need to be moving around (cooking, cleaning, etc.) while using ice, plastic wrap can help secure ice onto a muscle while you move. Ice your muscles for 10 – 20 minutes. While the first step should always be ice, a few hours later it’s a good idea to apply heat to the affected muscles to help stimulate blood flow to your muscles and help them to remain limber instead of tight. Apply heat for about 20 minutes.  Take a hot shower or bath. The water will relax your muscles as you soak. Adding Epsom salts to your bathwater is an effective home remedy for sore muscles. Epsom salts are made of magnesium, which is absorbed into the skin and works as a natural muscle relaxant.  Add two to four heaped tablespoons to a full bathtub and stir a little to dissolve. Enjoy your bath. You should feel some relief immediately after you finish your bath.  For stiff neck, take uncooked rice and fill a tube sock and tie off the end. Microwave for 1.5 minutes and use as a heat wrap. It is reusable. For isolated sore muscles, you can apply peel-and-stick heating pads directly to the skin and wear them under your clothes for hours. These can be purchased at most pharmacies. While it's tempting to completely relax your muscles as you recover, studies show that light activity that uses your sore muscles can reduce the length of time that you're sore. It's important to give your muscles time to recover, though, so be sure that you don't overdo it.  Exercise helps muscle soreness by increasing blood flow to the affected muscles, which helps them to eliminate waste more quickly and keep muscles from becoming stiff. Consider the intensity level of the workout that made you sore, and then do a lighter version of that activity the next day (similar to the intensity of a warm-up). For example, if running five miles has you sore, take a brisk walk for a half a mile to a mile. When you exercise to exhaustion, tiny tears occur in muscle fibers. The body's natural response to these tears is inflammation. Massage helps reduce the amount of cytokines the body produces, which play a role in inflammation. Massage also seems to increase the amount of mitochondria in your muscle, which enhances the muscles' ability to extract oxygen.  Massage also helps move lactic acid, lymph, and other stagnant toxins from the muscles. Seek out a massage therapist and allow him to work on your sore muscles. Massage therapy is relaxing, meditative, and healing. Massage the muscles yourself. Depending on the location of the soreness, you can try to give yourself a massage. Use a combination of your thumbs, knuckles and palms to work deep into the muscle tissue. You can also use a lacrosse or tennis ball to really work into knots and take the pressure off your hands. If you are massaging a sore muscle, don't focus on the middle of the sore muscle.  Focus more on the connections at each end.  This will help the muscle to relax more quickly.  So if your wrist is sore, massage your forearm. These handy devices make it possible to give yourself a soothing deep-tissue massage both before and after working out, which can loosen up your muscles and help prevent soreness as well as treating muscles and knots that are already sore. These are very useful for sore thigh and leg muscles but can also be used on the back, chest, and buttocks. Press the roller into the sore muscle and rub it up and down. The action helps relieve tension and stress.  Known as \"self-myofascial release,\" this method of massage was once only used by professional athletes and therapists but is becoming mainstream for anyone who participates in sports or fitness activities. You can purchase a foam roller at any athletic store or online. Check out this helpful wikiHow article for advice on how to use your foam roller to best soothe sore muscles. If you don't want to spend the $20 – $50 on a foam roller, you can use a lacrosse ball or tennis ball to roll under your body. If you need immediate relief, try acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (also known as NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin.  If you are under the age of 18, or if the person you're caring for is under the age of 18, avoid the use of aspirin. Aspirin in children under 18 has been linked to a dangerous disease called Reye's syndrome, which results in acute brain damage.  Try to avoid using NSAIDs on a regular basis. NSAIDs might reduce your muscles' ability to repair themselves naturally if you take them too frequently. It's best to find more natural ways of treating muscle pain if you can. The feeling of muscle soreness after an intense workout or when you exercise muscles that have not seen much action lately is usually normal, but there are some signs to watch out for that might indicate a more serious condition.  Normal muscle soreness after working out usually hits a day after your exercise routine, especially if you change your workout routine, increased your intensity, or worked muscles that you're not used to working. This muscle soreness typically peaks on day two and then gradually subsides.  Pay attention to any sudden shooting pains that happen while working out, which can signal a torn muscle. Also, watch for pain in your joints which might signal damage to a ligament or meniscus, or could be a sign of osteoarthritis.  Call your doctor if you experience any muscle pain that comes on suddenly or does not respond to the use of over-the-counter pain medication, or if the pain does not start to resolve after a few days."

      "If you're interested in learning more about the possible meaning of dreams and dream symbols, consider learning more about the field. Although we still know very little – including why we dream – new and interesting discoveries are being made.  Humans have tried for centuries to interpret and understand dreams. However, the first modern attempts only came in the early 1900s with the theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, many of whose interpretive ideas are still popular today. Currently scientists have a range of theories. Some argue that dreams don't really mean anything but are the result of random electrical signals in the brain; others think that dreaming evolved as a defense tool; and still others link dreams help us to process the emotions and events of the day. Looking into dreams may give you insight into your own psychology. But we still know very little about dreams and their function. Dream symbols may not always be universal – that is, they might not apply for everyone – and you probably shouldn't rely on them to make major life decisions. The internet has all sorts of website that purport to give the meaning of symbols like doors, water, fences, and other things. Many are even in handy, searchable “dictionaries.” If this sounds too good to be true, it is. Take these sites with a grain of salt.  Websites will often plug very specific meanings into symbols. Dream interpretation is actually a lot more messy than this. Given how little we know about the brain and dreams, you are better off relying on your own judgment or on the advice of a psychoanalyst.  Dream interpretation is highly personal and varies widely. There may be some symbols that carry a shared cultural or even universal meaning, but these are exceptions to the rule. Don't trust that a symbol really means what the “dream dictionary” says.",
      "Doors mean a variety of things in dreams. In general, people interpret them as a symbol of transition. Dreaming about a door suggests you are in need of change, or that you are currently in a transition from one stage of life to another. Doors can lead to adventure, secrets, opportunities and new beginnings. The saying “when one door closes, another one opens,” is very relevant here. Your door might be leading you to a new phase. The door's placement, condition, color, and kind are all important to the interpretation. A door in good condition, for example, might mean that your transition is a healthy or sound one. A dilapidated door might conversely mean you are uncertain or afraid of change.  What is the door's color? Some interpreters think a red door signifies that you are keeping anger or frustration bottled up. A black door symbolizes secrets, and opening it means that you are taking a risk. What kind of door is it? Trapdoors can represent hidden opportunities or, sometimes, suppressed feelings in the subconscious. A revolving door can mean going around in circles – that perhaps you feel your life is going nowhere. Are you outside or inside? Being inside might suggest you are in need of introspection and should take stock of your life, while being outside can represent freedom and opportunity. A closed door might mean closed opportunities. However, if your dream takes you through the door, what stands on the other side is also important. Pay attention to where the door leads, as this is closely connected to its possible interpretation.  For example, if you come across a land of plenty the dream might indicate you will transition to a glorious new phase in life. On the other hand, if the door leads somewhere depressing, dull, and sad, it could suggest you are afraid of change and holding back. A door that takes you somewhere familiar and comforting is a sign that you are ready to transition, but that you will remain whole, just more experienced and wiser on the other side. Moving through the door is important, as are the emotions raised. If you awaken with a memory of stepping over the threshold, for instance, this means that you are ready to embark on your new phase in life.",
      "Writing your dream down will both help you to recall its events and serves as a good reminder for the future. It should also gradually improve your recall of dreams in general.  Try keeping a dream journal. Pick up a notebook and use it exclusively for recording dreams, and keep it near your bed, like on a bedside table, for easy access. Get in the habit of writing down the details as soon as you can, before your waking mind forgets or starts to add items that weren't there originally. Focus on images rather than on telling a story when recording the dream. The sequence might not be important, and you may end up forcing the dream into a narrative. Start by re-reading your dream log and analyzing your personal link to doors in your dream. What and how does your mind associate with them? For example, do they remind you of your time working in a restaurant that had swinging doors leading into the dining room? What feelings do your associations raise?  Pay attention to the setting of the dream. Where did it take place? It is somewhere you've been before or a totally new, imagined location? Was anyone or anything else near the door in your dream? For instance, it might be important if your late grandmother stood and opened the door for you. As with a grandparent, the people who appear may shed light on your dream's overall meaning. Oftentimes they represent themselves, but sometimes they also reflect facets of our mind. For instance, a little child who tugs at your coat could represent an inner sense of guilt.  Who appeared in your dream? Besides their relationship to the door, think of who they are and what relationship you have with them. Oftentimes, the less direct personal relationship we have with someone in a dream means that it is more likely they are a part of our psyche – that is, your mind is trying to tell you something. Focus on how you felt during the dream, as emotion be the key to a dream's interpretation. If you felt nervous, there is a good chance that the door has something to do with inner anxiety. If you felt exhilarated, perhaps the door represents something hopeful that you are looking forward to. When you record dreams in your log, make notes about how the dream made you feel. All you need are impressions – happy, depressed, fearful, angry, anxious, powerful, etc. The psychologist Carl Jung thought that some images in dreams are actually universal symbols. These tap into a “collective unconscious” that goes across cultures. If you're serious about getting to the bottom of the doors that appear in your dreams, consider learning more about Jungian dream analysis.  For example, dreaming about being chased might mean that you are running from a fear – something that you feel unprepared for. Dreaming of death might signify transformation in your life; disease could mean an inner conflict."

Make sure you wear protective gloves or oven mitts. Let the sand heat the pipe up for a few minutes, until the PVC feels pliable. Once the pipe is soft, it should easily bend by hand. For a rounder, more even bend, use an old can or similar round, heatproof object and bend the pipe around that. Leave the pipe undisturbed and let it cool back to room temperature.

You may need to block the end of the pipe with tape to prevent the sand from falling out. The sand inside will make this take longer, but it also ensures that the pipe holds its form and doesn't cave or warp. Turn the pipe regularly, applying heat to the inner and outer bend throughout your entire marked heat zone. Keep the heat source at least two to three inches away from the pipe to prevent burning the PVC. Keep applying heat and bending until you get your desired shape. If you want a perfect bend, use a metal can or object to provide a \"mold\" for you bend. Do not try and keep bending the pipe after the sand is removed. This can cause cracks and warping.

      "A commercial water filter is the easiest and most effective way to filter sediment, pathogens, metals, and other pollutants from water. These filters contain special materials like charcoal, carbon, ceramic, sand, and cloth that are specially designed to filter out dangerous pollutants. There are many different types of filters you can use, including:  Whole-home filters that filter all the water that comes into your house Point-of-use filters that get installed on specific taps and filter water that comes out of the faucet  Countertop filters that you fill manually with water Water bottles and straws with built-in water filters  Handheld UV water purifiers that kill bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants from small quantities of water",
      "Boiling is a great way to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites from water. Fill a pot with water and heat it over medium-high heat, or over a fire. Bring the water to a boil and let it sit at a rolling boil for about 10 minutes. Let the water cool before drinking.  Water purification typically happens after three to five minutes, but especially at higher elevations, you must boil the water for longer. Boiling alone will not remove heavy metals or chemical contaminants from water, but boiling the water with the inside of a cactus could remove additional pollutants, such as arsenic. SODIS is an acronym for solar water disinfection, and when done properly, it’s a very effective method for killing pathogens in water. Fill a clear and smooth plastic bottle with water. Twist on the lid, and place the bottle on its side in direct sunlight for six hours to kill parasites, bacteria, and viruses. This method works because the plastic acts to trap heat from the sun inside the bottle, and the UVA rays pasteurize the water.",
      "For water that’s contaminated with large particles like pebbles, insects, plant matter, or dirt, you can strain out the contaminants. Line a fine-mesh strainer with muslin, cheesecloth, a clean dish towel, or even a clean cotton shirt. Place the strainer over a bowl, and pour the water through the strainer to remove the particles. Note that straining the water like this will only remove large particulates, not pathogens, heavy metals or other contaminants."

      "If you spin around too much and get dizzy, there's a good chance you'll lose your balance and maybe even fall down. Never try to get dizzy in the kitchen, or anywhere indoors.  The best place to get dizzy is outside, where there's plenty of grass and room to move around. Falling on the grass is ideal. If you have to be indoors, make sure there are no objects or toys on the ground, and that you're far enough away from furniture and walls that you won't get hurt. Don't spin so much that you'll fall down and you won't have to worry about getting hurt. Usually 7-8 spins will be enough to get you dizzy. You don't need much more than that. It's very hard to control your fall when you're super-dizzy, so it's easy to break a wrist or an arm, or hurt yourself worse. Dizziness and nausea are related. Unless you want to see what you ate for breakfast again today, don't make yourself dizzy if you've eaten something in the last hour or two. It's very important to have someone around if you're trying to make yourself dizzy. If your hurt yourself, someone who isn't all light-headed needs to be around to help you out, or steady you if you start to fall. Get your parents to watch you. If they say no, there's a good reason. Don't do it. If you're feeling too dizzy and you don't like it, just sit down and put your knees up and wrap your arms around them. Put your head in between your knees and just breathe deeply. Dizziness can be a sign of lots of different health problems, including blood sugar problems, eye problems, nerve problems, and imbalance in your inner ear. Dozens of kids in schools all around the world die each year from self-choking to get a \"high.\" Cutting off the oxygen to your brain is extremely dangerous, and can result in serious long-term brain damage, heart problems, and even death. It's not a \"high\" that you feel, it's your brain dying from lack of oxygen. Don't let any kids at school try to talk you into it, or tell you that \"it's not a big deal\" or \"it's a totally legal high.\" It's a really easy way to kill yourself accidentally.",
      "The easiest and most common way to get dizzy? Spin in a circle.  Look down at your feet and spin, as quick as you can, for about 7-10 times. You won't need to spin much to get dizzy.  Advanced method: Grab a baseball bat, or another stick a few feet long. Put one end on the ground and your forehead against the other. Spin while your forehead touches the bat. Don't try to run or do anything complicated after this. You probably won't be able to, and you might hurt yourself. Next time you go to the park, sit in the swing and twist it around until you can't anymore. Then let go and spin around really quickly. Spin on an office chair or a turning desk chair. Another simple way to get dizzy is just to crouch for a long period of time, your legs bent like you're in a huddle. Then, stand up abruptly. This is sometimes called getting a \"head rush,\" but it's basically the same as getting dizzy. If you're hungry, or if it's very hot out, this will be more intense. Dizziness can result in fainting if you're not careful. When your bottom is higher than your top, the blood rushes to your head and you can start to feel quite dizzy. Try to move as little as possible while you do this, and you'll notice the effects more.  Hang upside down from a swing-set, or from a fence, or from a pull-up bar. Make sure you turn around before you let go. Ride a roller coaster that goes upside down, or a ride one of the fair rides that you can control the spinning. The Tilt-a-Whirl is a great way to get dizzy. Often, if you start doing some exercise, like jogging, doing jumping jacks, or even something like jumping rope, you'll get a little dizzy. Pick something that will have you moving around, go outside, and do it. You get dizzy sometimes when your blood sugar is low and you need to eat something, or you get overheated. If you get dizzy when you do this, it's important to sit down, drink some water, and get something to eat quickly. Whether in a book or a picture online, optical illusions can get your head spinning even if you're sitting still. It's a great way to give yourself the illusion that you're moving without actually going anywhere.  Lots of moving optical illusions are available on YouTube. They're pretty trippy. If you don't like the optical illusions you find, try watching the iTunes or Windows Media Player visualizer while you're listening to some music you like. Wild stuff. Dizzy challenges are all over social networking and YouTube, featuring kids doing silly tasks after spinning to get dizzy in some way. Check some out for inspiration, or try doing one of the following things after you get spun:  Put on as many socks as you can Do a math problem Write your name Say the Pledge of Allegiance Walk a straight line, slowly Hit a whiffle ball"

      "Cats can make as many as 16 different meows. Paying attention to the different sounds can help you better communicate with your cat.  A short meow is typically a greeting. Multiple meows signal excitement A mid-pitch meow is a request, likely for food. A deep “Mrow” is usually a complaint. A high pitch “Rroww!” is an indication of anger or pain. A long drawn out “mrrroww” is usually a demand. In nature, cats only meow as kittens to get attention for their mothers. When they realize you do not respond to their other signals, they learn to meow. Often the meow is a way to communicate something the cat wants, but it can have other meanings as well.  Most frequently your cat’s meow is trying to articulate a request. A meow often means that they want food, attention, or to be allowed into a room. A meow can also signal distress. Cats vocalize when they are in heat, lonely, stressed, angry, or in pain. They also become more vocal when they get older. Other times a meow is a simple greeting similar to a “hello.” Some of the most important ways that cats communicate are through body language.  Cats, for example, have a complex language of signals that they make with their tails.  When a cat looks you in the eyes and makes a long, slow blink, they are showing affection. This is sometimes compared to a kiss. A cat approaching you with their tail in the air is a greeting that suggests your cat is happy to see you. This has been compared to a handshake.  If the fur on your cats hair is standing up, this is a sign that they are angry or afraid. When your cat's tail is low, or between their legs, they are insecure or anxious. A tail thrashing back and forth is a sign that your cat is angry. The faster they move it back and forth, the angrier they are.",
      "Cats are easily distracted, so you should create a quiet and calm environment. Place your cat on the table in front of you and pet them to put them at ease. Place the treats on the table to get your cat’s attention. Cats are more likely to respond to treats that they aren’t accustomed to. Try to get something new. Keep meowing until your cat meows and then give your cat a treat, and pet them. Continue as long as the cat is willing to participate. After your cat no longer seems to respond, take a break. Try again the following day. Repeat every day until your cat regularly responds when you meow. If you get frustrated and begin to be mean to your cat, they will become stressed and be less likely to respond. Cats do not respond to force. You must use positive reinforcement to encourage behavior."

      "Flip your car upside down and remove the wheels to access the black motor hardware. Remove the motor by loosening the screws using the proper screwdriver, and wiggling the cylinder-shaped motor until it comes free. Ensure that the new motor that you have chosen is the correct size for your Power Wheels. Remove the brushless motor from your secondary car. It will be cylinder shaped and you may need to remove some hardware to expose the motor. Wipe the motor clean with a dry rag to remove any buildup of dirt. You may be able to salvage the spade off of the Power Wheels motor by heating it gently and applying some pressure with a flathead screwdriver. If you can’t remove it, purchase an inexpensive spade from your local hardware store rather than potentially ruining the already-connected spade and the actual motor itself. Gently push the motor in spade-end first. Using your screwdriver, put the screws back into the hardware to hold the battery in place. The brushless motor may need some twisting and turning until it is solidly inserted so be patient and don’t try to force it. Carefully unwrap the wires from the original motor and re-attach them to the brushless motor following the same connecting points. At this point, a new battery could also be inserted if desired. Disconnect the battery to avoid getting shocked. Your car should be compatible with the remote from the brushless motor. Keep the car upside down as you test to be cautious, as the speed will be greatly increased.",
      "When choosing a battery, look for information on your Power Wheels battery to guide you on the exact specifications. You must note the voltage, chemistry, and size. For example: Fisherbrand Power Wheels batteries are often lead based, 12 Volt and are 16.0 x 11.0 x 8.0 so you must ensure ensure that the aftermarket battery you choose matches these specifications.  The advantage to after-market batteries are that they are inexpensive compared to the Power Wheels brand batteries. After the top cracks, use the screwdriver to pull the edges off the top away from the battery. Completely remove the top piece but be gentle to avoid damaging the casing of the battery. Stay away from the black connector inside the battery as this will be used to hook-up your new battery to your Power Wheels car. It will need to be replaced if you unintentionally damage it. After some wiggling, the connector will pop up and out of the rest of the battery. Pull the two attached positive and negative wires out as far as you can, and then gently clip them as close to the battery as possible.  Use wire cutters or crimpers to ensure a clean, crisp cut. these are available for only a few dollars at your local hardware store.  After the connecter has been disconnected, recycle your battery at the recycling depot. Batteries contain a large amount of nasty chemicals and are harmful to the environment. Insert a 30 Amp fuse into a fuse holder.  Once connected, strip approximately 1 cm of wire cover from each side of the connector using your wire crimping tool. Insert the exposed wire into a wire connector and crimp down on the wire connector to hold the wire firmly in place.  The positive side of the connector will be white or red. After crimping the wire connector, insert the one wire from the fuse to the other side of the battery connector. Crimp down to connect the fuse to the battery connector. Fuses, fuse holders and wire connector are available at local hardware stores. Attach an insulated female spade to the negative wire of the battery connector (often black) and the remaining exposed fuse wire. Female spade connectors come in many different styles. To save time, take your aftermarket battery with you to the store and compare the male components located on the battery terminals to the positive connectors in the store. Connect the negative battery terminal (black) to the negative wire of the connector (also black). Connect the positive terminal (red) to the fuse end of the connector. Be cautious and place your car upside as the speed will be greatly increased."

      "Particularly in poetry, authors may use language unconventionally in order to make a more powerful impact on the reader. This can be confusing at first, but re-reading the passage slowly and carefully will reward your attention. Look for footnotes and other aids. Often in books edited for a student audience, the editors will include explanatory footnotes, word definitions, and other aids that can help you grasp what’s going on. Don’t ignore these! They can really help clear up confusing passages. Especially if you’re reading poetry or plays, reading everything is very important. Skipping things such as stage directions in a Shakespeare play can mean you miss out on crucial information. Language in poems is precisely chosen and structured to have a particular effect, so missing even a word or two could damage your understanding of the whole text. This technique works especially well with poetry and plays, but it can also work for long, dense passages of prose in a novel, especially if it’s something like a Charles Dickens novel where sentences can run to a full paragraph. Reading the language aloud will help point out elements such as rhythm, alliteration, and repetition, which are all things that your exam may ask you to speak about. If you’re having trouble remembering things, make yourself some flash cards. Sometimes, the transfer of material from one medium to another (e.g., from written notes to flash cards) will help you learn it more effectively. Flash cards are especially helpful for memorizing things such as literary terms and character names. They may be less helpful for remembering more complex information.",
      "Don’t wait to study until the night before a big exam! Particularly with a subject such as English literature, where you will probably be asked analytical questions as well as content questions, you must have time to familiarize yourself with some of the complexities of your material. Being able to summarize the plot or name some characters is unlikely to be all you’ll need to do. Write out all the details you can remember from your first reading of the text, as well as anything you remember from your course lectures. Don’t “cheat” by looking at your notes or your text -- just write down what you are confident you remember. This will be your starting base and will reveal any gaps in your knowledge. Many tests and exams in English literature want you to be familiar with some key terms, such as stanza, irony, alliteration, speaker, and figurative language. While you’re not likely to be expected to have comprehensive knowledge of literary terminology, understanding some of these key concepts will be important to your success. There are many guides available that can help you find definitions for important literary concepts, but here are a few crucial terms:  A stanza is a poetic division of lines and is equivalent to the paragraph in prose writing. Usually, stanzas are at least three lines long; groups of two lines are usually called “couplets.”   Irony at its basic level says one thing but means another, which is almost always the opposite of what is actually said. For example, a character who meets someone in a raging blizzard might say “Lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?” This is ironic because the reader can see that it is clearly not lovely weather. William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Charles Dickens are famous for their use of irony.Do not confuse irony with misfortune, which Alanis Morissette’s song “Ironic” is culpable of: “a black fly in your chardonnay” is definitely unfortunate, but it’s not ironic.  Dramatic irony occurs when the reader or audience knows important information that a character does not, such as the fact that Oedipus killed his father and will marry his mother.   Alliteration is a technique used most often in poetry and plays; it is the repetition of the same initial consonants in multiple words within a short space. “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers” is an example of alliteration. A speaker usually refers to the person from whose point of view a poem is given, although it may also be used to refer to a novel’s narrator. Keeping the speaker separate from the author is important, especially in poetic dramatic monologues such as Robert Browning’s \"My Last Duchess,\" in which a maniacal duke admits to having murdered his first wife. Obviously, it is the speaker, not Browning, who is saying these things.  Figurative language is discussed in more length in Part 2 of this article, but it is the opposite of “literal” language. Figurative language uses techniques such as metaphor, simile, personification, and hyperbole to make a point more vividly. For example, in Shakespeare’s play Antony and Cleopatra, Cleopatra describes Mark Antony this way: “His legs bestride the ocean. His reared arm / Crested the world.” This is hyperbolic language: obviously Antony’s legs didn’t literally straddle the ocean, but it powerfully conveys Cleopatra’s high opinion of him and his power. If you were given a study guide or sample questions, see how much of this material you are already familiar with. This will help you zone in on what needs more work and make a study plan.",
      "Sometimes, knowing the type of poem you’re studying, such as whether it’s a sonnet or sestina or haiku, can be very important to being able to discuss its meaning. You can often determine what type of poetry you’re dealing with by examining the rhyme scheme (the pattern of rhymes at the end of each line) and the meter (the number of poetic “feet” each line has).  For example, Edna St. Vincent Millay tackles how difficult it is to write poetry in her poem “I Will Put Chaos into Fourteen Lines.” Knowing that this poem is a sonnet about writing sonnets helps explain part of what the poem’s goal is: putting a little modern “chaos” into a very old and established poetic form. Recognizing that Millay uses a classic Petrarchan rhyme scheme and that many of the lines are in iambic pentameter (meaning they sound like “ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM”) will help you identify the poem as a sonnet. Many modern poets write in free verse, but this doesn’t mean they aren’t also paying close attention to the form of their poetry. Look for elements such as alliteration, assonance, repetition, enjambment (the breaking of poetic lines), and rhythm in free verse poetry just as you would in more formally structured poetry. This is particularly important for poems such as dramatic monologues, where the speaker is definitely ‘’not’’ supposed to be the poet. Felicia Hemans, Robert Browning, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson all wrote dramatic monologues from the points of view of characters very different than themselves. Identifying the speaker can be trickier in lyric poetry, such as the type written by poets like Wordsworth or John Keats, because these poems are often written in first-person but don’t make a clear distinction between the speaker and the poet. Nevertheless, even in poems that are written using first-person pronouns like “I”, always refer to the speaker as the speaker, not the poet. Just as with prose writing, symbolism shows up all the time in poetry. Be on the lookout for repeated elements, especially things like colors or natural imagery.  For example, in William Wordsworth’s poem “Tintern Abbey,” the eye is an important symbol that represents many things, including the poet’s imagination. Wordsworth will often play on the similarity of sound between I and eye, further relating the two concepts. Symbolism is all over the place in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. One key symbol is the hall of Heorot, King Hrothgar’s great golden mead-hall. Heorot symbolizes community, bravery, warmth, safety, wealth, and civilization, so when Grendel invades Heorot and murders warriors in their sleep there, he’s violating everything about the Scyldings’ lives. Just make sure you  know the basics such as structure of the poem, themes, and overarching idea or story. It can sometimes be helpful to memorize a key line or two from a poem so that you can use it as evidence. For example, if you’re studying Walt Whitman’s huge poem Leaves of Grass, you might want to memorize the short phrase “dismiss whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem.” This short quotation encapsulates much of the meaning from the larger text, and being able to drop it into an exam will help you support your claims. Context is just as important for poetry as it is for fiction or drama. Knowing what types of issues the poet may have been addressing can help you understand the goal of the poetry. Contextual information can also be useful in keeping you from making incorrect statements about poems. For example, it’s important to know that Shakespeare’s sonnets are not all written to female lovers, even though that was the standard for sonnets of the era. In fact, most of them are written to a “fair youth,” a wealthy young man to whom the poet has some sort of deep, possibly romantic, attraction.",
      "You should have already read the text for class, but if you’re studying for an exam, make sure you go back and re-read it to catch things you missed out on the first time. Many authors use techniques such as metaphors, similes, and personification to emphasize their points. These may be crucial to understanding the literary work you’re reading: for example, knowing that the white whale in Moby-Dick represents (among other things) Captain Ahab’s hubris is essential to being able to understand Melville’s novel.    Metaphors make direct comparisons between two seemingly dissimilar things. They are stronger than similes. For example, the last line of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby is a famous metaphor comparing human lives to boats trying to make progress against a strong current: “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”  Similes also make comparisons, but they don’t directly state that “x” is “y”. For example, Margaret Mitchell uses a simile to describe Scarlett O’Hara’s interest in Ashley Wilkes with a simile in her novel Gone With the Wind: “The very mystery of him excited her curiosity like a door that had neither lock nor key.”  Personification occurs when a non-human animal or object is given human characteristics in order to express an idea more powerfully. For example, Emily Dickinson frequently uses personification in her poems, as in this poem about a snake: “A narrow fellow in the grass / occasionally rides; / You may have met him, -- did you not, / His notice sudden is.” Here, the snake is a “narrow fellow” who “rides” in the grass, which makes it seem almost like a dashing Victorian gentleman, rather than a reptile. The way that an author expresses her or his ideas is often as important as the ideas themselves. In many cases, the form and structure of the text will have some kind of influence on its subject matter.  If you’re reading fiction, think about the order in which the events are recounted. Are there flashbacks or places in the narrative that cycle back in time? Sandra Cisneros’s novel Caramelo begins close to the end of the actual “story” and switches between various times and places in order to emphasize how complicated family histories are. If you’re reading poetry, think about the form of the poetry. What type of poem is it? Is it something formally structured, like a  sonnet or sestina? Is it free verse, which makes use of elements such as rhythm and alliteration but doesn’t have a set rhyme scheme? The way the poem is written will often offer clues as to the mood the poet wanted to convey. An archetype is usually a character -- although it may also be an action or situation -- that is believed to represent something universally recognized as part of human nature. The influential psychologist Carl Jung argued that archetypes tap into the “collective unconscious” of humanity, and thus we recognize experiences we’ve shared with others in archetypes. Several types of of literature analysis have been influenced by Jung, so being familiar with some archetypes that may appear in your text will probably be useful.  The Hero is a character who embodies good and often fights against evil in a struggle to bring justice or restore order. Beowulf and Captain America are perfect examples of the Hero archetype. The Innocent Youth is a character who is usually inexperienced, but whom others like because of the faith s/he has in other people. For example, Pip in Charles Dickens’s novel Great Expectations is an Innocent Youth, as is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. Often, these archetypes will experience some sort of “coming of age” in later parts of the story. The Mentor is tasked with caring for or protecting the main character through wise advice and assistance. Gandalf in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit is an excellent example of a Mentor archetype, as is Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars movies. The Doppelganger is a character who doubles for the main character in order to represent the “dark side” of the hero or heroine. Common examples of doppelgangers include Frankenstein and his Creature in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Robert Louis Stevenson's' novel of the same name. The Villain is a character with evil plans whom the hero must oppose. The villain will usually do anything to defeat the hero and is often, though not always, clever. Good examples include Shere Khan from Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, Smaug the Dragon from The Hobbit, and the Joker from the Batman comics and films. The other main type of archetype you’ll probably encounter is situational, i.e., a very familiar and expected type of plot and progression. Some common situational archetypes include:  The Journey. This is an incredibly common archetype and is referenced in everything from stories of King Arthur to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver’s Travels to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. In this archetype, the main character undertakes a journey -- physical or emotional, literal or figurative -- to understand something about herself/himself or the world around her/him, or to achieve an important goal. Often, the journey is very important to the plot, as with the Fellowship’s quest to destroy Sauron’s One Ring in the Lord of the Rings.  The Initiation. This archetype has similarities with the Journey, but the focus is more on the hero/heroine’s developing maturity through their experiences. This type of story may also be called a ‘’bildungsroman.’’ Henry Fielding's Tom Jones is an excellent example of this, as are the origins of most comic book heroes (for example, Peter Parkers lessons about how to handle “great power and great responsibility” as he becomes Spiderman). The Fall. This is another very common archetype. In this archetype, the main character experiences a fall from grace as the consequence of her/his own action. Examples of this archetype are all over classic literature, including King Lear from Shakespeare’s play King Lear, Ahab from Melville's novel Moby-Dick, and Satan from John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost. For many texts, particularly plays and fiction, there is an “inciting incident” that sets the main action of the story in motion. This moment disturbs the equilibrium of the situation, poses a problem, and sets off a series of events that will form the rest of the story.  For example, in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Macbeth hears a prophecy from a trio of witches that says he will become King of Scotland. While he has never wanted to be king until this moment, the prophecy sets him on a path of ambition and murder that eventually leads in his downfall. As another example, in Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible, a group of young girls face a conflict: they’ve been caught doing naughty things in the woods and face punishment. To try to cover up their actions, they accuse their fellow villagers of witchcraft. This action incites the rest of the play’s story, which follows these accusations as they spin out of control.",
      "This will make future review easier, as you will have a rough summary to work from. Don’t get too bogged down in summary. You don’t have to summarize every little thing that happens in a chapter or act. Aim to note the main action of each one, as well as any important character or thematic moments. Include anything important that the character says or does, along with links to other characters in the text. For plays, you may want to note any speeches that seem particularly important, such as Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” speech or the “attention must be paid” speech from Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. This can often be even more helpful than chapter summaries. What challenges and conflicts do the main characters face? What are their goals? For example, Shakespeare’s Hamlet has several problems he needs to solve: 1) Is the ghost of his father urging him to seek revenge trustworthy? 2) How can he take revenge on his uncle in a court full of people who are watching his every move? 3) How can he overcome his natural tendency to overthink things to work up the courage to take the revenge he wants? Sometimes, problems are solved fairly neatly at the end of a story: the Death Star is destroyed in Star Wars, the One Ring is destroyed and Aragorn restored as King in Lord of the Rings. Sometimes, problems are solved but not in ideal ways: for example, Hamlet does achieve his revenge and fulfill the ghost’s request, but he also kills several innocent people along the way and ends up dead himself. Understanding whether characters achieved their goals, or why they didn’t, will be useful in discussing the works in your exam. While you don’t necessarily need to memorize important statements or speeches, remembering what they’re generally about can be very helpful when you go to make an argument about a text. For example, if you’re studying Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, remembering that Mr. Darcy admits to meddling in Elizabeth’s family affairs will be useful in explaining why they are so angry with each other early in the book (i.e., he is too proud to admit that meddling really was wrong, and she is too prejudiced to admit he might have had motivations that made sense). Don’t skimp on detail here! Noting that “the tone of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is very sinister” won’t be much use in the exam if you don’t have a way to describe what’s making it feel sinister.  Write down particularly vivid moments from the text. Not only can these help you remember what happened in a chapter, they will give you evidence to use when you make claims about the text in your exam. For example, consider this quotation from Chapter 41 of Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, when Ahab has finally caught up with the White Whale: “He [Ahab] piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.” This is far more evocative than simply saying “Ahab attacked the whale.” This passage emphasizes that Ahab is after the whale not just for taking his leg, but because he’s come to embody every single horrible thing that has happened to humans since time began in this whale, and he is willing to destroy himself -- it’s as if his chest is a cannon, remember, with a cannonball exploding from it -- to take the whale down. Symbolism is a favorite tool of authors. If some element, such as a color or specific item, shows up more than once or twice, it’s likely to be a symbol that represents something important. For example, in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The Scarlet Letter, the “A” that Hester Prynne must wear in punishment of her adultery is an obvious symbol, but her daughter Pearl also serves as a symbol. Like the “A,” Pearl is a reminder of her adultery, a “token of her shame.” Hester often dresses Pearl in beautiful gold and red dresses, physically linking her to the letter and to Hester’s crime. It is often very helpful to be able to reference in your exam or essay some important cultural or social issues that were relevant at the time a text was first written. Use any course material you have, along with introductions to critical editions of the text and reliable resources such as those found through a library database to do a bit of research. Do not rely on websites such as wikipedia or your own knowledge of a period, as both of these may be incomplete or inaccurate. For example, if you are studying Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s short story \"The Yellow Wallpaper,\" it’s important to be able to speak about the condition of women in the late 19th century. Gilman was a very important feminist writer who wrote against the traditional social structure of her time, which insisted that a woman’s only place was as a wife and mother. Importantly, her arguments usually insisted that this structure harmed men as well as women -- something that is very useful to bring up in a discussion of her fiction, and something you might not know if you were only acting on “common knowledge” of the era."

      "There are multiple reasons to wear a knee wrap. Many people who exercise will wrap their knees as a means of giving their knees a bit of additional support while they exercise. Some people do it if they have had a partial tear in a ligament and are seeking some external support. Weight lifters will also wrap their knees prior to doing squats to give the joint some additional stability. If you have or think you have sustained an injury, make sure your see your doctor before performing any strenuous activity. Knee wraps are not generally used to treat a severe injury or condition. Knee wraps are used for the prevention of injury or knee issues. They provide a bit more stability and external support to the joint of your knee when it is put under extreme stress.  The only kind of treatments a knee wrap is used for are first degree sprains of the knee. This can only be diagnosed by a healthcare provider. If you sustain any injury, see your orthopedic surgeon. The risk of getting injured again or misdiagnosing can cause serious damage. There are many instances where a wrap is not needed. If you have an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear or any other ligament tear, do not treat it with a knee wrap unless explicitly instructed by your orthopedic surgeon. It would also not be appropriate to simply wrap your knee with a medial or lateral meniscus tear.  If a knee wrap helps an injury and your surgeon sees no problem with using this method while you wait for an upcoming surgical repair, then you can use it. Never use this as a means to stabilize a grossly unstable joint for purposes for recreation. If you feel that, despite wrapping your knee, you have been injured, see your physician right away. Only the doctor can diagnose exactly what is wrong with your knee. The doctor may advise you to wrap your knee injury if it is a grade I injury for purposes of stabilization only. If your wish to start or resume physical activity, seek medical attention first to see if your injury has healed.",
      "You need to have the right materials to wrap your knee. You need to buy a knee wrap, also called a compression bandage. These can be bought at any general store or pharmacy. The most popular brand is ACE, but you can also find other brands to buy as well. You also need something to hold the bandage on with. Most bandages come with elastic clasps with metal hooks, but in case your bandage doesn't, you can tuck the bandage into itself.  You can also buy self-sticking bandages, which use adhesive on their surface to stay snug. Others have velcro along the edge of the wrap. Choose whichever one you think is best for your situation. You can also buy different sizes of bandages as well. Buy the size that you feel will fit your knee best. When wrapping your knee, you need to make sure you are in the correct position. First, have a seat in an open area where you have plenty of room to move around.  Next, extend your right leg out in front of you. There should be plenty of extension in your leg, but it should also be relaxed, with just a bit of passive comfortable flexing in your knee. Make sure there is enough room to move your arms around your leg. This will ensure that you have room to work on your knee."

      "Find the L-shaped metal brackets as well as the 2 remaining slide pieces. Fit a bracket into 1 end on each slide. The brackets easily slide into the frame track. The free ends of the brackets will attach to the cabinets with screws. To make sure the bracket is placed correctly, test the frame pieces by fitting them inside the cabinet. Place the slide frame pieces inside the cabinet. Push the brackets all the way to the back. The frame pieces should be flush with the bottom edge of the cabinet and rest against the side walls. If you are using undermount or center mount slides, place the frame pieces on the cabinet’s bottom. The frames need to be level from front to back. To check this, set a carpenter’s level on top of the frame. Reposition each frame as needed until the leveling tool is even from left to right. When using a bubble level, for instance, the bubble will move to the center of the level. Mark where the frames rest on the cabinet. You can draw directly onto the cabinet with a pencil. Create the lines right over the ends of both frames. Then, mark the spots where the brackets and rails will be screwed in place.  Each bracket has 2 screw holes to mark. The rails will have at least 1 hole at the opposite ends. Make sure the lines are dark enough to see as you secure the rails. Drill into the spots you marked earlier. These holes prevent the screws from breaking or cracking the wood. Use a drill bit about 2⁄3 in (1.7 cm) wide to create holes about 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) deep. Set 2 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) screws in each bracket. Use an electric screwdriver to secure the frame to the cabinet. Then, set another screw in the front end of the bracket to secure the slide in place. Gently install the screws and avoid making them too tight. Line the drawer’s slide rails up with the cabinet’s rail frames. The drawer’s slides should fit in the frames. Push the drawer in to make sure it glides smoothly. If the pieces are installed correctly, the drawer will come to a gentle stop inside the cabinet. If something seems off, check to make sure the slides are even and level. You may need to readjust the screws.",
      "Take everything out of the drawer. Pull the drawer all the way out of the cabinet and set it aside. Most drawers will pop out if you pull them back. If this doesn’t work, you may need to undo a latch or screw on the drawer’s. The latch or screw will be located near the back end. Pull the drawer out as far as possible. Use a screwdriver to remove the existing hardware.  The hardware will always be a couple of slide pieces attached with screws. Depending on the type of slide you have, the metal track will either be underneath or on the sides of the drawer. The other half will be in a similar location inside the cabinet.  The slides will attach with at least one screw each on the front and back ends. You may need to press down clips located on the slide tracks to unlock them. These will come off when you unscrew the slides. Measure the length of 1 of the old slides. Drawer slides come in a few different sizes. To ensure you get what you need, measure the drawer before purchasing new slides.  If you do not have a slide available, you can measure the drawer or cabinet from front to back. The standard slide length is 14 in (36 cm). However, deeper cabinets will have longer slides.",
      "Lay the drawer on its side. The slide needs to be flush against the drawer’s bottom edge. The slide’s thicker, squared end should be flush with the drawer’s front edge.  Undermount slides attach to the bottom of the drawer, one each on the left and right edges. For center mount slides, use 1 per drawer. The slide attaches to the bottom of the drawer, running from front to back along the center. Draw directly on the drawer. Create a thick, dark line right above both ends of the slide. Also mark the spots where the slide will be screwed to the drawer. The slide will have a screw hole at both ends. Get an electric drill with a drill bit  approximately 2⁄3 in (1.7 cm) wide. Drill about 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) into the screw spots you marked earlier. Drilling the holes in advance prevents damage to the cabinet when you add the screws later. Set the slide back on the drawer. Align its top edge with the mark you made earlier, adjusting the slide so the holes are over the spots you drilled. Place a 1⁄2 in (1.3 cm) screw in each hole. Fasten the slide in place with an electric screwdriver. To avoid damaging the wood, tighten the screws gradually. Stop when the slide feels firmly in place and doesn’t wobble. Find the other small slide piece. Flip the drawer over so the other side is facing up. Then, line up and attach the other slide the same way you did with the first one."

      "(LCM) for the denominators. Because you have to make the denominators the same before you add the fractions, find a common multiple that they share. Then choose the lowest one. For example, for 9/5 + 14/7, the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 while the multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. 35 is the least common multiple. You'll need to multiply the entire fraction to make the denominator become the least common multiple. For example, multiply 9/5 by 7 to get a denominator of 35. You should also multiply the numerator by 7, so the fraction becomes 63/35. Remember that when you adjust 1 fraction in your problem, you also have to adjust the other fractions so they're equivalent. For example, if you've adjusted 9/5 to 63/35, multiply 14/7 by 5 to get 70/35. Your original problem 9/5 + 14/7 will turn into 63/35 + 70/35. Once all of the denominators in your problem are the same, add the numerators. Put the answer over the denominator. For example, 63 + 70 = 133. Place it over the denominator to get 133/35. If your answer is improper, turn the fraction into a mixed number. To do this, divide the numerator by the denominator so you get a whole number. Then see how many parts are left and place this number over the denominator. Reduce the fraction if it can be simplified further. For example, 133/35 can be simplified to 3 28/35. The fraction can be reduced to 4/5 so the finished answer is 3 4/5.",
      ". If you have fractions with whole numbers, changing them into improper fractions will make it easier to add. The numerators of your improper fractions will be larger than their denominators. For example, 6 3/8 + 9 1/24 will turn into 51/8 + 217/24. If the denominators are different, you'll need to write down the multiples of each denominator so you can find 1 that they have in common. For example, for the problem 51/8 + 217/24, list the multiples of 8 and 24 to find 24. Because the multiples of 8 include 8, 16, 24, 32, and 48 and the multiples of 24 include 24, 48, and 72, 24 is the lowest common multiple. The denominators should all become the lowest common multiple that you found. Multiply the whole fraction by a number to make the denominator the lowest common multiple. For example, to make the denominator for 51/8 become 24, multiply the whole fraction by 3. You should get 153/24. If the other fractions in your equation have different denominators, you'll also have to multiply them so they have the same denominator. If the fraction already has that as the denominator, you don't need to adjust the fraction. For example, if you're working with 217/24, you won't need to adjust the fraction since it already has the same denominator. You can add the numerators once the denominators are the same or if there were the same from the start. Once you've added the numerators, put the answer over the denominator. Avoid adding the denominators. For example, 153/24 +217/24 = 370/24. . If your numerator of your answer is larger than the denominator, you'll have to divide it to get a whole number. To finish making a mixed number, write down how many parts you have leftover. This will make the numerator which you can put over the same denominator. Keep reducing the fraction down until it's in its simplest form. For example, 370/24 will become 15 10/24 because 24 goes into 370 15 times and has 10 parts of 24 left over. 10/24 can be further reduced to 5/12 for a finished answer of 15 5/12."

      "It’s imperative that you know the soil composition before purchasing farmland. Ask the seller for a recent soil test, and if they haven’t had one done, arrange for a laboratory to analyze the soil content. Loam is an ideal soil type for farmers as it holds water well. Clay holds too much water, and sand doesn’t hold enough water, so these soil types would need to be amended. Consider the forage type when buying farmland—western wheatgrass, blue maidencane, giant cane, switch cane, green silkyscale, and many varieties of bluestem are suitable forage for cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Find out how much of the land is grazeable, and how much is not. Look for less than 30% rock cover to ensure your livestock will have enough forage available. Ask the seller or realtor what kind of irrigation and drainage systems are in place. Look for access to a high-quality water source, such as a well or river for crop irrigation or watering livestock within 1 mile (1.6 km). You should also find out how much erosion damage the land has. Inspect the ditches to see if they are clean and find out if they are able to handle the average amount of precipitation. Field history refers to what kinds of crops have been grown as well as what kinds of herbicides have been applied to the land. If you plan to raise livestock on the farm, ensure that the herbicides used in the past won’t affect the animals. Though most herbicides are safe to use on forage, you should still do an Internet search to find out if there are any grazing restrictions for the particular kind of herbicide used.  If you plan to grow a certain crop, make sure it will work well together with what has previously been grown based on which nutrients the plants use the most. For instance, if beans were last planted on a plot, tomatoes would do well in the area but lentils would not. Take a close look at the fencing, buildings, pastures, lakes, ponds, wells, and roadways of the property. Determine if they are in good repair or if they will need fixed or upgraded. You should also evaluate whether the existing facilities, plumbing, and electricity will meet your needs or if you’ll need to add new infrastructure. Find out if the rights to gas, minerals, and wind have been severed from the surface rights of the property. The seller and/or realtor should be able to answer any questions you have about property rights. Ideally, gas, mineral, and wind rights should transfer to you as the buyer, but this isn’t always the case. If the rights are already leased out, go over the terms of the contract with a lawyer to ensure you are happy with the agreement. The most important factor when evaluating farmland is the amount of revenue the farm is making. Chances are, if the farm isn’t making money now, it won’t make money for you in the future. Visit the nearest farm service agency (FSA) office to learn more about the farm’s revenue. You’ll be able to view past records for the property. Though you’ll have to pay to have this done, it’s an essential step to protecting yourself as the buyer. The property, facilities, and infrastructure should be inspected and appraised by professionals so you can make an educated decision about the value of the property. They’ll let you know if there are any issues with both the land and the facilities. Appraisals generally cost between $300 to $400, while inspections usually cost between $200 to $400, depending on the location and amount of land.",
      "The FSA provides farm loans to family-sized farms throughout the United States. There are a variety of loans available, such as for micro farms, young farmers, Native American tribes, new farmers, emergencies, or minority and women farmers. To find out more information and to apply for one of these loan programs, visit https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/. If you don’t qualify for a government loan, you can get a private loan. Though big-city banks can assist you with plenty of transactions, it’s best to speak with a rural property lender when buying farmland. They will be familiar with the specific intricacies regarding loans for farmland. Once your money or funding is secure, you can put in an offer on the property you wish to buy. It’s best to start with a low—but fair—offer, such as 10% below the highest amount you’d be willing to pay, to leave room for negotiation. Your realtor can help advise you further and make the offer to the buyers. The buyer may accept your offer or ask for more money. Your realtor can work with both of you until an agreement is made. Then, a contract will be drawn up and a lawyer and/or realtor can help explain the terms of the contract to you, if necessary. Now is the time to make amendments or ask for upgrades! Once you sign the contract, you’ll need to put down earnest money until the deal is closed. To protect your investment, you may want to purchase both title and flood insurance. Title insurance guarantees your right to the property at the closing price and will also let you know if the area has been used for hazardous waste dumping. If the property is in a flood zone, you’ll be required to purchase flood insurance before closing on the property to protect yourself from losses due to flooding. Once both parties are happy with the contract, you can close on the property. Usually, you’ll need to meet the realtor and seller at the title company to close. The deed will be transferred to your name, and any keys to the gates or buildings will be handed over. You’ll be expected to provide the remainder of the money for the property at this time, usually by means of a certified check.",
      "The land you need will differ depending on what crops you want to grow or what livestock you want to raise. Take some time to carefully consider what kind of farm you plan to run. What do you intend to do with the land? What crops or animals does the land need to support? What kind of buildings, fencing, equipment, and irrigation will you need? Knowing the purpose of the farm will help you target exactly what kind of land you’ll need. If you plan to grow crops, think about what kinds and how many acres you’d need for each. Similarly, if you plan to raise animals, decide what kind, how many you’ll have, and how much land you’ll need to support them. Keep these figures in mind when viewing properties, and avoid visiting locations that can’t support the type of farm you plan to run. For instance, if you plan to raise cattle, you’ll need 1.5 to 2 acres per head. Factor in the cost of the land, property taxes, upkeep, and maintenance. You may also need to add buildings (like barns or stables), fencing, and irrigation or purchase equipment and make other upgrades. Estimate your income from running the farm, taking into account crop or meat prices, to help you determine how much financing you may need to get the farm running. To find a certified realtor in your area, visit https://www.realtor.com/. A realtor will have tons of information that can help you make an informed decision. Plus, they are paid by the seller, so there is no up-front cost to you. Realtors can help you navigate the offer, appraisal, and closing and ensure you understand all parts of the transaction. Choose a certified realtor who has experience with rural properties and farmland in the area you plan to make a purchase. It’s a good idea to have a general location in which you wish to purchase the land. Consider the average weather conditions for the area and find out if it is prone to natural disasters, like fires, tornadoes, or floods. Find out the average property values and taxes for the area and determine if you’ll be close enough to work, school, grocery stores, medical offices, and the like. Once you have determined where you would like to own farmland, you’ll need to identify the zoning regulations for that specific county. Contact or visit the county courthouse where the property is located and ask if the land is zoned for farming. If it’s not, you’ll need to search for land in another county."

      "with shapewear. Hormone changes early in your pregnancy can cause bloating, so you may notice your waist expanding a little even before you get a true “bump.” Try putting on some slimming undergarments, like Spanx or control-top stockings, to tuck in your belly and help you fit into your pre-pregnancy clothes a little longer. If you’re concerned about what the pressure of shapewear might do to your growing baby, don’t worry. The protective layer of amniotic fluid in your womb will keep them nicely cushioned. You might find tight garments more uncomfortable as your body grows, however. Tops that are loose, ruffled, or flouncy can flatter your figure and disguise your growing belly. Try a flowy tunic or a blouse with ruching along the sides. Tops or dresses with empire waists are also a good way to go, since they skim your figure without accentuating its curves. In cooler weather, big, slouchy sweaters are a comfy and fashionable way to conceal your baby bump. Layers can distract the eye from your midsection and add volume to your outfit without drawing attention to your belly. Try putting on a loose blazer or a drapey cardigan sweater over a blouse or tunic. If you feel brave enough to try layers with contrasting prints or patterns, this can also minimize the appearance of your belly. For example, you might wear a black-and-white polka dot blouse with a colorful floral blazer. Wearing a slouchy top with baggy pants can give you a bulky appearance. Create a more slim and streamlined look and balance out your top half by wearing something more form-fitting on your legs. For example, you might try wearing a baggy tunic sweater with a pair of comfy leggings. In cooler weather, you could match a flowing blouse or shirt-dress with some tights or stretchy slim-fit jeans. Choose a long, oversized scarf and drape it on so it hangs down in front of your torso. This can add the appearance of length and slimness to your figure. Scarves and other accessories, such as bold pieces of jewelry, can also draw the eye and take the viewer’s attention off your belly.  Scarves in dark colors, like black or navy blue, create an extra slimming effect. Bright or colorful accessories are eye-catching and can create a new point of focus for your outfit. Try a brightly-colored scarf, a big pair of hoop earrings, or a sparkly necklace. Prints are a great way to draw attention away from your changing shape. Have fun with colorful floral tops, or stick to more conservative spots, checks, or stripes if you prefer. While conventional wisdom has it that vertical stripes are more slimming, studies have shown that wearing horizontal stripes is actually better for minimizing the appearance of width. Horizontal stripes are very popular in maternity wear, however, so be careful not to clue people in with too many stripey outfits!",
      "If you enjoy an occasional alcoholic drink with family and friends, they’re bound to notice if you go cold turkey. Try discreetly ordering a virgin version of your favorite drink next time you’re out. Offer to mix the drinks yourself if you’re socializing at home—that way, you can mix your own alcohol-free cocktail without anyone noticing. If you’re out with your significant other or a friend who knows your secret, you can both order the same drink. Pretend to sip yours, then sneakily switch drinks when theirs starts to get low. Other people drinking with you are unlikely to notice. If a fake-out isn’t possible, have a plausible excuse ready for when someone offers you something you can’t eat or drink. You can pass it off as a lifestyle change or health issue unrelated to pregnancy.  For example, if someone offers to buy you a cup of coffee, you could tell them you’re trying to cut back on caffeine to improve your sleep at night. If you have to turn away a soft cheese hors d’oeuvre, you can say something like, “My stomach’s been upset a lot lately, so my doctor recommended I try going dairy free.” If you’re plagued with morning sickness, your friends and coworkers may notice that you’re feeling under the weather. Eating ginger candy or sipping ginger-based drinks (like ginger tea or old-fashioned ginger ale) can help settle your stomach and make your symptoms less obvious to others. Bland foods like plain crackers or dry cereal can also help combat nausea.  Make sure to sip plenty of water throughout the day, too—getting dehydrated can make morning sickness worse. If you do feel the need to vomit, try going into the bathroom or finding another secluded spot where you can sit with your head between your knees for a few minutes. This may help the feeling pass, or at least buy you time to find some privacy before you have to throw up. If you know that you tend to feel more tired and queasy at particular times of the day, avoid planning exercise or other tiring activities with friends at those times. Figure out when you’re at your most energetic, and make time then.  For example, if feel too tired and sick for a morning jog with a workout buddy, you might suggest doing some afternoon yoga instead. Try saying something like, “I’ve been wanting to check out this new yoga class for a while. Want to give it a shot?” You can also make an excuse, if necessary. If you’re too exhausted or nauseated to participate in an activity, you could say that you’ve got a mild stomach bug or that you’re busy trying to catch up on work deadlines. Even if you’re not ready to tell most people in your life, you might want or need to share your pregnancy news with a select few. If you do tell someone, let them know in simple terms that it’s just between the 2 of you. Ask them to respect your desire for privacy until you’re ready to tell others. Try saying something like, “I wanted to let you know that I’m pregnant, but I’m not ready to share the news with anyone else yet. Please don’t talk to anybody about it without asking me first.”"

      "Track when you feel tired, how long your sleepiness lasts, and any changes you’ve noticed since taking Xanax. Write down what you try to alleviate the sleepiness and if it helps. Write down your symptoms in a notebook or use a phone application to track them. Once you’ve tracked your symptoms, share them with your prescriber. Present this information to your prescriber so that they can see what your symptoms are, how long they last, and what interventions you’ve tried. Your prescriber may choose to adjust your dosage or switch medications for you.  Keep in mind that medications inherently have side-effects that may be unpleasant. You may need to decide whether your sleepiness is livable and if the positives of Xanax outweigh the costs. If you find it too difficult to stay awake and you’ve tried various methods, it may be time to discuss changing medications. If you take medication for anxiety long-term, consider switching to another type of anti-anxiety that doesn’t induce drowsiness. For example, ask your prescriber about taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) medication, which have a lower chance of dependency and may have different side-effects. SSRI medication also is safe for long-term use. Talk to your prescriber to see if this medication is right for you.",
      "Not getting enough sleep can result in struggling to stay awake, especially when you take Xanax. Stick to good sleeping habits to maximize your waking and sleeping states. If you have a hard time falling asleep, try sticking to a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on the weekends. Artificial light from the television or electronic devices (such as tablets and smartphones) can disrupt your sleep, so keep them out of your bedroom, especially at night.  Try a relaxing bedtime routine each night. For example, take a bath, light a candle, sip on tea, and dim your lights. This can help you unwind and feel calm. Keep in mind that short naps (under 30 minutes) will not make up for lost sleep, but they can help to improve your mood. The foods you consume can contribute to your energy levels, so focus on nutrient-rich foods that will fuel your body and mind. Eat foods with whole grains and that are rich in fiber. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and avoid eating many foods that are processed or high in sugar.   Eat healthy meals regularly. Treat yourself to less nutritious foods on occasion. For example, create a healthy daily meal plan such as oatmeal and fruit for breakfast, a sandwich with raw veggies for lunch, a fruit smoothie for a snack, and roasted vegetables with rice for dinner. Get in the habit of planning your meals so that you can ensure that they’re tasty and nutritious. Long-term nicotine use can cause a change in your arousal levels and it may also lead to other unwanted effects on your adrenal system, which can contribute to drowsiness.  Alcohol can contribute to fatigue and it also affects the quality of your sleep. Try to avoid smoking cigarettes (or using other nicotine products) and drinking alcohol while you are taking Xanax to help reduce drowsiness.",
      "Some fresh air can help to keep you awake and alert. If you tend to stay inside much of the day, take a few breaks and head outside. Getting some sunlight (especially in the morning) can help regulate your waking and sleeping cycles so that you’re fully awake during the day and can sleep well at night.  Take a walk during your lunch break or ask to meet with people outside. For example, if you have a dog, go for a walk each morning so you can maximize your sun exposure. Engaging in social activities can help to keep you alert and involved. Find a friend to talk to. This might also be a good time to make any necessary phone calls.  Avoid using instant messaging to communicate; it’s best to speak in-person or over the phone to stay awake. Talk to another student or co-worker throughout your day. Schedule regular meetings so that you can be continuously engaged. Avoid reaching for the sugary snacks and grab something that will give you long-lasting energy. For example, try eating a handful of nuts or a bowl of fresh fruit. Spread some nut butter on a whole grain cracker or eat a yogurt. When you get a craving for a snack, get in the habit of fueling yourself for long-term energy to help avoid any lows that might make you drowsy or tired. If you’re struggling to stay awake, get up and take a 10-minute walk. Moving around can increase blood flow and provide oxygen throughout your body. Simple movement can help increase energy for up to 2 hours.  If you can’t take a walk, do some stretches or movements to wake up your body. Try some jumping jacks or burpees. If possible, use the gym or attend a yoga class in the morning or during lunchtime. Adding a supplement to your day can help to increase energy and keep you awake. For example, B vitamins are known to help increase energy, especially if your diet is low in B vitamins. However, beware of supplements that promise energy without any research or support.  Speak to your physician before starting any new supplements or medications. Be cautious of using stimulants like caffeine as they can increase feelings of anxiety.  Caffeine may also affect the quality of your sleep."

      "You don’t want your child to be bullied or be a bully. Talk to your kids about bullying behavior to stop it before it starts. Go over how bullying hurts other people and makes the bully look bad. Talk about consequences of bullying, such as losing friends, getting in trouble, and risking school intervention.  Ask your children, “What would it feel like if somebody said something mean to you on Facebook?” You can also ask, “What would you do if someone said something mean about you or your friend?” This can help build critical thinking skills and increase empathy. Supervise your child’s use of Facebook and all other social media. Monitor their social media use and put into place some firm boundaries. You can put the computer in a public part of your home, only allow social media at certain times of the day, or create other rules for your child’s safety and well-being.  Don't allow your children to be on Facebook if they're under 13. Facebook's rules prevent children under 13 from having an account. If your child is being bullied on Facebook, have them delete their account, and keep them from using social media until they are older. Help them find healthy and productive ways to have fun and socialize with their peers face-to-face. Children learn best by observing those around them. Be careful how you treat people both in day-to-day living and online. Model good behaviors for your children so that they learn to respect others and not bully. Show your children how you handle difficult situations. For example, if someone says something mean to you on Facebook, show your children a mature response.",
      "If the bully is sharing inappropriate content, is endlessly harassing you, or is breaking any laws, make sure to document these things. Take screenshots or photos of the bullying comments to use as evidence. That way, you’ll be ready with evidence if you want to go to the internet service provider, school administration, or police. Take a photo of the content and make sure it clearly shows the name of the person posting. You may also want to take a photo of their profile to show that you are recording their identity and not somebody else by the same name. The police should be involved if you have received physical threats, racial taunts, or another form of major harassment or insult. Contact law enforcement immediately if someone posted photos or videos of you being mistreated, demeaned, or showing nudity. If someone posted nude photos or videos of you and you are under 18, this is a very serious offense and the person could get into major legal problems. Report the content right away and do not take a screenshot as this could be considered spreading child pornography. Consider going to see a guidance counselor for help at your school or university. Ask them about the school policy regarding bullying and harassment. If it includes bullying that happens on the internet, you may be able to get the school involved in discipline. Find out what help and resources are available to you and how you can get the bullying to stop.",
      "Initially, it might be enough to ask the person to stop bothering you. If they keep it up, leave a public comment letting them know you’re not okay with their behavior. Publicly calling them out and knowing that other people can read your comments might shame them into stopping.  For example, if you write a comment on an article and somebody attacks your views, write a private message or comment, “That was really rude. It sounds like we have differing opinions but please don’t insult me.” If a private message doesn’t work, reply publicly. For example, you might reply to their comment with, “This comment is really rude and inappropriate. There’s no need to use personal attacks. Please stop.” You might feel safe responding from the relative \"safety\" of your computer, but firing back insults will only increase the problem and could result in more conflict and even real-life confrontation. Ignore their attempts to upset you into responding, even if they egg you on.  If someone attacks you or says mean things about you (whether you know them or not), don't respond with another insult. Take some time to cool down with some deep breaths and let it go. If you must comment back, say something like, “We differ in opinion and I don’t think we’ll change each other’s minds. Let’s end the discussion there” or “Please don’t insult me.” Often, bullies want a rise or a response from someone. Don’t give the bully the satisfaction of knowing you or someone else is affected by their comments. Ignore the comments and don't let them get to you. You might be angry or upset when you first see a comment that’s about you or someone you know. Take a moment and don't respond right away. Calm down so that you don’t let the person (or the comment) get to you.",
      "Don’t post negative, rude, or disparaging comments about other people. If you see someone else making those kinds of posts, don’t share or like them. Avoid participating in hurtful gossip about others, even if it’s over private messaging. Be sure to make your settings safe by only letting your known friends see your account and interact with you. Avoid disclosing any private information on your public profile such as where you live or what your phone number is. Make all of your posts, contacts, and information private and unable to be seen by anyone who is not your friend on Facebook to protect your identity and information.  Some people choose their display name by only disclosing their first and middle names instead of including their last names. Even if your account is set to private, think carefully before you post something. Consider how you might feel about the post ten years from now. . If you're unhappy using your Facebook account or you feel like events on Facebook are out of control, consider deleting your Facebook account. You can always open a new account when you're feeling stronger. If Facebook is causing you more headache than connection, consider deleting your account. That way, nobody can contact you or harass you on Facebook and you will be completely removed from it.",
      "Online bullying often looks different than bullying that happens in-person, and you’ll need to identify the behaviors if you want to report them. Bullying might be saying mean comments (such as, “Levi doesn’t have any friends, I don’t even know why he comes to school.”) or negatively replying to posts (for example, writing, “Why do you write such stupid things?” or “Your photos make you look dumb.”). Someone might post an embarrassing photo or video of you which the clear intent of harming you or ridiculing you. If someone starts a group or page putting you down (such as, “All the Reasons Ryan Sucks”), you can definitely report this as bullying. . As soon as you see questionable content, take action. Whether you know the person or not, you can write a report on Facebook and send it to Facebook administration for review. They will likely notify the poster and the content will be blocked or erased.  To report content, click “Report post” on the original post and click through the options provided. When finished, click “Submit” to send it to Facebook. For example, you might see someone bullying someone else in an article thread. Even if you don’t know the people, you can still report the bullying. . If someone continues to harass you or post mean things about you, report their profile. You can report any profile, even if you’re not friends. You can specify why you are reporting the person when you make the report.  To make a report of the person, go to the person’s Facebook page and click “Report” and click through what you are reporting. For example, if you see someone who constantly attacks other people or their views, report this person. Whether you’re friends with the person on Facebook or not, you can block the bully. Blocking a person means you cannot interact with them and they cannot interact with you. They cannot tag you, see your content, start a conversation with you, or add you as a friend.  If you unblock the person, you will not be friends on Facebook, even if you were friends when you blocked them. The bully can still write about you on Facebook on their timeline, but they will not be able to tag you or share their post with you, even if it’s publicly shared. You will not see their posts. You might see content you don’t like but that doesn’t violate Facebook’s terms of service. It might be questionable or just something you don’t like. If you’re not sure whether the content is appropriate for Facebook, click “Report post.” Click through and determine what can be done. If it does not violate Facebook’s terms, then you can message the person and ask them to remove the post. Say, “That post isn’t nice. Would you mind taking it down?”"

This can be a scary and confusing time in your life, and you shouldn't do it alone. Choose people you can trust or count on to help you.  Consider asking a trusted family member, friend, colleague, or neighbor. If you don't feel comfortable talking to anyone in your real life yet, find a therapist you can talk to. You can also find support groups in your area through the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or at local treatment facilities. Treating mental illness can be a long and difficult journey. Recovery and progress take time. Sometimes you will feel worse before you feel better. This is due to the difficult process of psychotherapy and also the trial-and-error nature of psychopharmacology. Do your best to be patient, trust your treatment providers, commit to their treatment recommendations for an extended period of time, and let the process work.",
      "If you think you want to get a psychiatric evaluation, try talking to someone you trust. This may be a family member, friend, coworker, doctor, teacher, or religious leader. Having support from someone you trust can help you decide.  For example, you may say, \"I haven't been feeling the best. I think I may have a mental illness and want to get evaluated. What do you think about that?\" If you believe you should get tested, don’t let people discourage you. Your mental health and well-being comes first. General practitioners cannot perform psychiatric assessments or tests. You need to see a licensed mental health professional, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, licensed social worker, licensed professional counselor (LPC), or licensed mental health counselor (LMHC).  You can get a referral to a mental health professional from your physician. You may also want to look up mental health professionals in your area. Your insurance company can help you locate a professional in your area that is covered by your insurance. Thinking that you need mental health care can make you feel like something is wrong or that you are broken. You may think that you're the only one who has this sickness, and that you will be considered strange and different. This is not true. You shouldn’t feel upset about needing help. Getting help is important so you that you can receive the treatment you need.  Many common problems, such as depression, are made worse by the feeling of being alone. Many problems like this are very common, so you are not alone.  People who have suffered the same problem can help you understand it and cope with it. 1 in 25 adults living in the United States experiences a severe mental illness that interferes with their ability to function. 1 in 6 adults in the United States takes some form of psychiatric medication. Professional psychiatric assessments and tests aren’t intended to have right and wrong answers. There isn’t a way to study for them. To ensure that you’re diagnosed properly, only take an assessment that’s administered by a mental health professional. Then the mental health professional can accurately determine your condition and create a treatment plan. Many nonprofessional tests that aren’t scientifically sound are available online, but you should not look at them. They can skew your results and either cause you to be misdiagnosed or make you think that you have more problems than you do. Though the words “psychiatric assessment” may sound scary, it is nothing to fear. Psychiatric assessment and testing can help get you a proper diagnosis so you can receive treatment and alleviate any negative symptoms or complications related to your condition. If you think you may have a mental illness, you may want to learn more about them. This may help you get an idea about what your problem could potentially be. You can check out books about different conditions from your local library, or you can search online. There are many reputable websites about mental illness, but try not to diagnose yourself. Remember, you need a mental health professional to diagnose you.  A good rule of thumb is to make sure the condition in question is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Otherwise, the condition may not be legitimate. People with emotional conditions respond to situations in such extreme ways that they make things worse. Developmental disorders deal with handicaps that prevent normal mental growth. Physiological problems occur when there is a problem with the brain that is caused by physical problems with the nerves or muscles.",
      "Many psychiatric assessments first require a clinical interview, which is where a mental health specialist talks to you. They will ask you about your concerns, why you think you need the assessment, and what is going on with you. They also may ask you about your family history. Based upon your interview, the mental health professional decides what further assessments may be necessary. The mental health professional will observe you closely, including both your body language and what you say. In addition to being interviewed, the mental health professional may request to interview people that you are close to. They may want to interview family members, friends, coworkers, or others you interact with. Interviewing of others requires your written consent. They cannot interview someone without your permission. Another thing often discussed during a psychiatric assessment is your social life and relationships. This may include relationships with your family, partners, children, or friends. They may also ask about your interaction with people at work or in social settings.  They may ask you about your social habits, like how often you date, where you go when you go out, and what kinds of social activities you engage in. You will also talk quite a bit about your childhood, including your family of origin and the dynamics of these relationships. Though it’s important to be open and honest during your assessment so you can get the right diagnosis, you may not be ready to talk about some things. That is okay. You can tell your mental health professional that you are not ready to discuss certain things, but be honest about what you can.  If you need, you can bring a friend or family member with you to support you if you think you need it to discuss difficult things. It’s better to be vague and tell the truth than to lie. For instance, you can confirm that you experienced abuse as a child but decline to discuss it further. This is more ideal than refusing to answer the question or denying that anything occurred.",
      "Psychological and psychiatric tests are similar to medical tests in that a doctor or mental health professional looks at your symptoms and orders a test to understand the underlying cause. These tests may check for certain character traits, developmental problems, emotional disorders, or physical problems. For example, if a child has difficulty in school, they may be tested for a learning disability. A person who feels down, lethargic, or like they can’t get out of bed may be tested for emotional disorders. Many psychological tests are formal questionnaires and checklists that contain standardized questions. Generally, your answers are ranked and given a score. This score correlates to a potential psychological problem or underlying character trait. These questionnaires generally ask about how you feel, like if you feel sad, hopeless, or nervous often. They also may ask about your emotional responses to things, like if you get angry or upset when things happen, and your sleeping patterns. During your assessment, the mental health professional may want to know more about your health. This may include any illnesses or problems you have had in the past, any treatments you have undergone, and any current medications you are taking. For example, you may tell them if you have mental illness in your family. You can also share health conditions like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other condition."

      "Making the Ball"
    ],
    "document": [
      "You can figure this out by picking lots, rolling a pair of dice, guessing numbers, or simply by age. For example, the youngest person could hold the ball first.  Don't get too worked up over who gets to go first. Sometimes, it's actually better to go last, because then you'll have a chance to get to the really good gifts! Make the game more challenging by having the players wear gloves or mittens. The ball holder could also wear a blindfold. You really need a set of dice for this game because the entire goal is to roll a set of 2 matching numbers in order to pass the ball. If you can't get a pair of dice, then use just 1 die and pick a number to be the passing number.  For example, if you have just 1 die, then you could settle on 6 for being the passing number. Don't blindfold the dice roller! They need to see what they are rolling, after all! This needs to happen at the same time. The goal for the ball holder is to unroll as many layers on the ball as possible until the person with the dice rolls a set of matching numbers.  For example, the person with the dice can roll a set of 1s, or a set of 2, or a set of 3s, and so forth. If you're using just 1 die, then keep rolling it until you hit the passing number you settled on. This game will probably have several rounds, so consider giving the ball holder a basket or a goodie bag to store all of their items in. If you used multiple sheets of plastic wrap per item layer, have the ball holder crumple them up and set them aside. The person who just finished rolling the dice should now have the ball, while the person to their right should now have the dice. If you used 1 continuous sheet of plastic wrap for the ball, you might want to cut or tear it off at some point. This way, it won't get in the way. You get to keep whatever gifts you unwrapped. The faster you unwrap, the more gifts you'll get!",
      "Small, flat items are easy to wrap. Larger items, like DVDs aren't because they are large and rigid. If you want to include a larger gift, then stick with something flexible, like a pair of socks. Remember, these items have to wrap and curve around each other in order to form a spherical shape. The outer layers of a saran wrap ball should be inexpensive. Candy is a great choice, but you can also choose goodie bag fillers, stocking stuffers, and other $1 toys. For example:  Edible treats, such as chocolate, mints, or gum. $1 toys, such as plastic bugs, toy cars, or crayons. $1 stocking stuffers, such as hand sanitizer, lip balm, or compact mirrors. As the ball grows smaller, the game will get more exciting and intense. Here is where you should put in larger, more expensive gifts. Themed jewelry and socks that are in the $2 to $5 range are great here. You could even step the gifts up to a $10 or $15 value here. For example:  Christmas jewelry, such as necklaces or earrings. Christmas accessories, such as scarves or socks. Money in $1 or $5 increments. This is the final prize, so it should be something that is worth waiting for! Gift cards are the most popular choice, but you can also pick out something that's more expensive too. For example:  A small, themed gift, such as an action figure. Money, but in a higher amount, such as a $20 or $50 bill. Movie or concert tickets. Candy is appropriate for all ages, but as you get towards the center of the ball, you should consider what your guests would like. You don't want to let them down with something that they wouldn't find interesting, after all. For example:  A 7-year-old might enjoy a $15 gift card to a toy store. A college or high school student might prefer a $25 gift card to iTunes. An adult might appreciate a $50 gift card to store that sells home décor or accessories. Saran wrap balls are a popular Christmas party game, but you can also play them during other events, such as baby showers or bridal showers. Party supply stores are a great place to pick up themed prizes. For example:  Pastel-colored candy is perfect for a baby shower. You can also use pink or blue candy depending on the baby's gender. For a bridal shower, consider choosing themed gifts. Anything in hot pink with lots of rhinestones is sure to be a fun bet. If this is for a birthday party, consider the theme. If this is an astronaut themed party, then use space-themed gifts, like astronaut ice cream or alien figurines.",
      "Try to make at least 3 piles. The first pile should contain inexpensive gifts, like candy. The middle pile should have slightly-more expensive gifts, like lip balm or hand sanitizer. The last pile should container your most expensive gift. Sorting your gifts ahead of time will make it easier to find what should go into each layer. This will be in the center of your ball, so you need to start with it first. Cover it at least 1 layer of plastic wrap, although 2 or 3 might be better. You can tear off the plastic wrap once you have the item covered, or you can leave it be and continue to wrap the ball in one, continuous layer. Hold the item against the plastic that's covering the first item. Wrap more saran wrap around it to hold it in place. Again, you can tear off the sheet of plastic wrap after this, or you can keep going with 1 continuous strand. This gift should be the most expensive one out of your middle pile. Stagger the items so that they aren't places directly on top of each other. For example, place 1 item on the top of the ball, another on the bottom, and a third on the side.  Try to have each item separated by at least 1 layer of plastic wrap. Remember, you are working from the inside-out, so you need to start with the better gifts that will be towards the middle of the ball. As the ball continues to grow in size, you could include multiple items per layer. For example, you could have 1 item on 1 side of the ball and another item on the other.  If the ball is the size of a soccer ball or a basketball, then stick with just 1 item per layer. If the ball is the size of a beach ball, then you could include multiple items per layer. This will help keep everything secure and  make the ball easier to transport to the party. Rather than just going in 1 direction for each wrap, alternate the directions that you wrap the ball in. For example: Wrap the ball horizontally for the first layer, then vertically for the next. Finish off with 1 or 2 diagonal wraps."

      "Adding Music to Your iPod",
      "Connecting to iTunes for the First Time"
    ],
    "document": [
      "To begin the process of adding music to your iPod, open iTunes. If you haven't already connected your iPod, do so as soon as iTunes opens. Within a few moments, iTunes should recognize your device — you should see a small \"iPod\" button with a picture of an iPod appear in the upper right. Click this button. Note that for iPads, iPod Shuffles, and other iTunes-compatible devices, the process will be nearly the same, though the label on the button that appears will change. After clicking the \"iPod\" button, you'll see a screen displaying an array of information about your iPod, including its name, storage capacity, and several other options. We don't need to deal with any of these — simply click \"Music\" at the top of the window to proceed. When it comes to putting music on your iPod, you have two options: iTunes can automatically transfer your entire library to your iPod, or it can allow you to manually choose which songs you want to add. Check the bubble next to \"Entire music library\" if you'd like to add your entire library, or check the bubble next to \"Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres\" if you'd like to pick your songs manually. At this point, you may also want to check the boxes for other miscellaneous options below. For instance, if you'd like to add any music videos you have in your library, check \"Include music videos,\" and so on. If you chose the manual option for adding songs to your iPod, you'll want to use the menus on the bottom half of the iTunes window to choose which songs you want to add. Scroll through the menus for playlists, artists, genres, and albums, checking the boxes next to the choices you'd like to add to your iPod.  For instance, if you want to add all of your Al Green songs to your iPod, you would scroll through the list of artists until you found Al Green, then check the box next to his name. On the other hand, if you only wanted to add the songs from his greatest hits album, you would scroll through the list of albums until you found Greatest Hits by Al Green, then check the box next to it. Don't worry if some of your choices overlap — iTunes won't add the same song to your iPod twice. Whether you chose the manual or automatic option for adding songs, click the \"Sync\" (short for \"Synchronize\") button on the bottom right of the screen when you're ready to add your songs to your iPod. iTunes should immediately begin to add the songs you selected to your iPod. You can monitor your progress by watching the progress bar that should appear at the top of the iTunes window. Don't disconnect your iPod during this process. This will disrupt the syncing process, preventing you from getting all of your songs. In addition, this can also cause iTunes to freeze or stop working properly. Congratulations! You've successfully added songs to your iPod. To play your songs, disconnect your iPod, plug in a pair of headphones, select a song from the \"Music\" option at the bottom right of the iPod's main menu, and start listening. Note that, while this guide describes how to add music to your iPod, the process is nearly identical for other forms of media. For instance, if you want to add movies to your iPod, you would click \"Movies\" at the top of the iTunes window after clicking the \"iPod\" button, then proceed in basically the same fashion. To take songs off your iPod, connect it to your computer and proceed as you normally would to the Syncing screen. If it isn't already selected, click the bubble next to the \"Manual\" option for adding songs. Now, scroll through the windows of artists, playlists, etc. and uncheck the boxes next to the selections you'd like to remove from your iPod. When you're done, click \"Sync\" to apply your changes.",
      "If you don't already have iTunes, you will probably want to download and install it before beginning. Though it's possible to add music to your iPod without iTunes (see above), this is by far the most common way to do so. In addition, iTunes is free, simple to download and install, and offers a variety of helpful features, including in-program access to the iTunes Store and options for automatically syncing your iPod library to the library on your computer. To download iTunes, simply visit iTunes.com and click the \"Download iTunes\" link in the upper right. Supply your email address and click \"Download Now\" to start the download. Your new iPod should be packaged with a white USB cord. This cord allows you to transfer media between your computer and the iPod. Connect the skinny, flat end of the cord to your iPod (there should be a corresponding port on the bottom of the iPod) and the other end to one of your computer's USB ports to begin. Note that models of iPod other than the standard version (like, for instance, the iPod shuffle) will have cords with differently-shaped plugs. However, all varieties of iPod cord will have one end that plugs into a USB port. When you connect your iPod, iTunes should launch automatically. If it doesn't, you may open it manually. Within a few moments, iTunes should recognize the iPod. You will know this is happening if you see the trademark Apple logo appear on your iPod without prompting. You may also notice a progress bar appear at the top of your iTunes window indicating that iTunes is downloading data required to interface with your iPod. Wait for iTunes to complete before proceeding — this may take several minutes.  If iTunes doesn't seem to be recognizing your device automatically, don't despair. iTunes is somewhat notorious for experiencing problems with new devices. Try disconnecting your iPod and reconnecting it, opening and closing iTunes, and restarting your computer before reaching out to iTunes support. Additionally, if your iPod is low on power, you may need to wait for it to charge off of your computer's power supply for several minutes until iTunes is able to recognize it. Eventually, iTunes should automatically launch a large welcome message. Click \"Continue\" to proceed. Next, you'll see a screen that says \"Sync with iTunes\". Click \"Get Started\" on this screen. You will be brought to a screen that presents you with a variety of options, including:  Updating your iPod software to the latest version. If your iPod software isn't current, clicking \"Update\" will download and install the latest version of the software. This keeps your iPod up-to-date with all of the features and security fixes. Creating a backup of your iPod data. If this is the first time you're using your iPod, you won't have any data to back up, but choosing an automatic backup location (either your computer or the iCloud) ensures you won't have to worry about it in the future. To exit the current screen, simply click the blue \"Done\" button in the top right of the iTunes window. When you do this, you'll be brought back to whatever you were looking at in iTunes before you began. From here, you can add music to your iPod as you normally would (see \"Using iTunes\" section above)."

      "If you aren't interested in disassembling the puzzle at any point, you can use a specialized glue to permanently attach the pieces together. This can create a glossier, sturdier piece of artwork, but may reduce the value of your puzzle. Because of this, this method is not recommended for antique or valuable puzzles, and some puzzle hobbyists do not use it at all. Because your assembled jigsaw puzzle may have slightly different dimensions than listed on the box, use a ruler or tape measure to get an accurate measurement before selecting a frame. Some craft shops sell frames in pieces, which you can reassemble into rectangular frames with a custom length/width combination. Select poster board, foam board, or sturdy cardboard approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick, and cut a rectangle that can be inserted into your frame.This material will provide a backing for the puzzle, keeping it flat and in the frame. A utility knife is recommended to make even cuts, along with a T-square or protractor to ensure the sides are cut to at 90º angle. Avoid using thin cardboard or other easily bent material, as this may cause the puzzle to warp over time. Protect the surface underneath the puzzle by carefully slipping something flat and disposable, such as wax paper, underneath the puzzle. Small bumps and loose pieces can be evened out before gluing with a rolling pin. Press down on the rolling pin as you move it across the puzzle surface several times. Purchase specialized jigsaw puzzle glue from a craft store or online. Use a paintbrush to apply this glue across the surface of the puzzle, covering the entire area with a thin layer. Pay special attention to the cracks between pieces. If your puzzle glue comes in powdered form, read the instructions to learn how to prepare it before use. Your bottle of puzzle glue may contain specific directions, telling you how long to wait for the glue to dry. If it does not, leave the glued puzzle alone for at least two hours. Test to see if its ready by gently lifting one end of the puzzle. If the pieces are still loose or coming apart, wait longer or apply more glue. Apply glue to the surface of the foam board or cardboard you cut earlier. Carefully transfer your glued puzzle over the foam board, aligning it with the edges. Press the puzzle down onto the foam board, then scrape off any excess glue that was squeezed out from between the two objects. If the glue does not hold or looks uneven, you may pay someone at a craft shop to \"dry mount\" the puzzle professionally onto a backing material. Leave the puzzle alone for at least 24 hours so the glue can achieve maximum strength. If the puzzle looks bent or uneven, weigh it down during this drying period with a large book or other heavy object with a larger surface area than the puzzle. Don't use heavy objects with a small or uneven surface area, as these may compress your puzzle unevenly, or even damage it. Once the puzzle and backing material are dry, place them in the frame. Lock them into the frame using the tabs or arms at the back, or by whichever method is built into the frame. Optionally, fit a glass or hard plastic cover over the puzzle to prevent scratches. For best preservation of the puzzle's colors, use a UV-resistant glass cover.",
      "Hobbyists who wish to preserve the usability and value of a puzzle, but still wish to display, will need a specialized frame. While these frames are often described as \"500 piece puzzle frames\" or \"1,000 piece puzzle frames,\" purchasing one based on actual length and width measurements is recommended for more accuracy. Because the frame will be the only thing keeping your puzzle in place, it is important to find a frame that will fit your puzzle as securely as possible. Some frames called \"jigsaw puzzle frames\" are just ordinary frames made to fit common puzzle sizes, and will not hold your puzzle together without glue. Instead, you'll need a specialized frame, which is often more expensive. While you may attempt to use any frame with a solid back and front portion, finding one specific to jigsaw puzzles is recommended, as a jigsaw puzzle is thicker and more fragile than the posters and photographs ordinary frames are usually used for.  Try the glass-fronted, aluminum MyPhotoPuzzle frames, or the adjustable-size Versaframe.  Note: there are a couple cheaper options for displaying your puzzle, at the end of this section. The exact design of a jigsaw puzzle frame varies between brands. For MyPhotoPuzzle frames, carefully press the glass onto the puzzle surface, flip the glass and puzzle together face down, then lower the backboard over the back of the puzzle. Make sure one of the hanging attachment on the backboard is located at the top of the puzzle, or it will be upside down. Lower the frame over the backboard and glass, then lower every clip around the backboard's edge to fasten it to the frame. The Jigframe comes with a sheet of acrylic plastic, protected with paper on both sides. Briefly warm the sheet in the sun or near a heater if necessary to help peel off the paper. Slide or construct the puzzle on top of one of the included \"Jigsheets.\" Slide open the drawer in the frame, place the Jigsheet with the puzzle face-up on top of it into the drawer, then cover the puzzle with the acrylic sheet. Slide it back into the frame.  Instead of sliding the puzzle, You can use one of the Jigsheets to lay over the puzzle and help keep it steady while you flip it over, then lay the other Jigsheet over the back of the puzzle, and flip it face up again. If the puzzle is much smaller than the frame, a small piece of cardboard is included to place on the Jigsheet, below the puzzle's lower edge, to center the puzzle. Other companies may use a different system than the ones described above. An adjustable frame may be sold in two pieces, which are slid together over the puzzle and locked into the correct position. Some coffee tables have an additional glass surface that can be screwed on and off the table. Place a jigsaw puzzle under this layer for display. These envelopes are typically made of polypropylene, and may be labeled \"archival grade.\" This will keep your puzzle safe from moisture and other sources of damage. However, these are more typically used for prints and photographs, and may be hard to find in sizes appropriate for medium or large puzzles."

      "If you want extra power, try adding other ingredients - some people like a bit of mint or some apple cider vinegar for whitening, although results may vary. If you want to try out different oils to see what works best for you and yields the best results, get as many as you'd like and to try to use a different one each morning for a full week. Keep a fully stocked kitchen with a variety of organic oils and experiment with their benefits and uses. Organic virgin oils like coconut oil aren't always the cheapest thing at the market, but they're incredibly versatile: you can use coconut oil to make your own toothpaste, massage oil, in your hair, and in your next stir-fry. Some people are turned off by the concept of making a mouthful of cooking oil the first taste of the morning, but it is important to do before you clean your mouth or consume anything, so make it easy on yourself. Consider measuring out the oil before you go to sleep and leaving it by your bedside, or set out on the bathroom counter top so that you don't have to think about it. Put it in your mouth and start swishing. If you usually keep your toothbrush on the counter, put it away and put a tiny glass of oil in its place. It'll become a habit in no time. If you typically do some calisthenics or light stretching in the morning before breakfast, make oil pulling part of the regimen. Wake up your body and get your day started right. The more you make it part of some routine, the easier it will be to make oil pulling a regular thing in your life. Whatever you typically do in the morning, add oil pulling to the routine. Look over the newspaper briefly while swishing the oil, or read your favorite blog.",
      "Some oil pullers suggest that sesame oil is the most effective oil for oil pulling, while others prefer the taste and texture of coconut oil. Consider alternating oil varieties every couple of days to get the full benefit of all the oils and see what works best for you. Virgin olive oil and sunflower oil are also commonly used for oil pulling. Avoid canola oil and other varieties processed with additives. It's important to do a pulling before you've consumed any food or drink in the day and also before you've brushed your teeth. You'll have the opportunity to clean your mouth out afterward, and it won't take long to complete the routine. The oil will mix with your saliva, absorbing and \"pulling\" toxins from your mouth. As the oil is swished around the mouth, teeth, gums, and tongue, the oil will continue to absorb toxins, usually turning somewhat viscous and milky. It's important to spit out the oil when it starts to feel thick. This usually takes somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes, and certainly no longer than 20.  You don't want to hold it in your mouth so long that the toxins start to reabsorb. Spit into the trash can and rinse your mouth thoroughly with warm water, which tends to do a better job getting the oil out than cold. Make sure not to spit it into a sink or toilet, because it may clog the drain.",
      "Studies have shown that regular oil pulling reduce the amount of s. mutans, a common oral bacteria responsible for a variety of oral diseases and a major contributor to tooth decay, plaque, gingivitis, and cavities. The lipids in the oil work to pull out bacteria and keep bacteria from sticking to the walls of the mouth. An emulsifier, vegetable oils increase saponification, which accounts for the cleansing, soap-like texture you'll notice when doing an oil pulling. Halitosis is caused by bacteria and fungus in the mouth and on the tongue, and using virgin oils regularly to oil pull will reduce these bacteria and fungi, fighting bad breath and contributing to a clean, healthy mouth. If you struggle with bad breath, work oil pulling into your routine. Some people attribute oil pulling to the general detoxification of the body and a diversity of positive effects, including reduced hangovers, reduced pain, headache relief, insomnia relief, and other cures. Studies show that virgin oils, sesame in particular, are particularly high in antioxidants sesamol, sesamin, sesamolin, Vitamin E, and antioxidants shown to halt the absorption of bad cholesterol in the liver. The antibacterial qualities of virgin oil support the use of pulling to promote general oral health."

      "Planting Sweet Peas",

      "Maintaining Sweet Peas"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Sweet peas of all varieties thrive in sunny areas, making them a great choice for exposed sections of fence and walls. In the heat of summer, sweet peas will do fine in partial shade, but it's better to find someplace sunny to be on the safe side. Since sweet peas love to climb, find a spot where they can grow toward the sky. They produce small tendrils that will latch onto any type of pole you plant them near.  Sweet peas make an excellent natural decoration for fences. If you have a wooden or chain link fence you want to brighten up, plant sweet peas there. Sweet peas are often grown on trellises or archways. This is another lovely choice, and will lend your garden a country cottage feel. If you don't have a suitable place for sweet peas, erect a few bamboo posts in your garden and plant sweet peas there. It'll lend some height and interest to your garden. You could also create a tower of stakes in a pot or a small arbor. You can plant sweet peas among other plants, like shrubs or vegetables. Sweet peas grow best in rich soil that drains well. Prepare the soil for planting by tilling it to a depth of 6 inches (15.2 cm) and working in some compost or manure. This is especially important if your soil is clay heavy; you'll need to work in extra compost to make sure it drains well enough for sweet peas' roots.  To determine whether the soil drains well enough, observe it after a heavy rain. If water collects and puddles and takes time to drain, the soil there doesn't drain well. If the water soaks in right away, it should be fine for your seedlings. Using a raised bed is a good option if you feel your soil is too clay heavy to support seedlings. This will come in handy for other plants you want to grow as well. Whether you started your seeds inside and are planting seedlings, or you want to plant your seeds directly in your garden bed, early spring is the right time to do it. If you live in a warm area where the ground never freezes, you can plant in January or February. If you live in an area where the ground does freeze, wait until just after the first frost, in early to mid April. If you're transplanting seedlings, dig holes 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart and deep enough to set the seedlings root balls into the ground. Pat fresh soil lightly around the stems of the seedlings. For seeds you're planting directly in the ground, dig holes one inch deep and 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart. When they sprout, you'll need to thin them out to 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart, so each plant has plenty of room to grow. Finish by giving the plants a good dose of fresh water. The sweet peas will begin to spring up quickly once warmer weather sets in.",
      "Sweet peas are usually started from seed. You may either plant them in seed trays indoors and later transplanting them to the garden bed, or start them outside. Seeds are available for purchase at any garden store. For rarer varieties, check online retailers.   \"Old-fashioned\" sweet peas will produce very fragrant flowers. Spencer varieties have bright colors, but less fragrance. You'll find them in pink, purple, blue, white and red. Sweet peas can be grown in any growing zone, but it's important to know the right time to get them ready. They must be planted as early as possible to form a strong root system and survive the summer. Therefore, starting seeds early in the year is usually your best bet.  If you live in a temperate area where the ground does not freeze in the winter (USDA zones 8-10), you can plant your seeds directly in the ground as early as November, though waiting until January or February is also fine. Be sure to water them over the winter, and they'll emerge in spring. If you live in an area where the winters are cold, starting seeds indoors is your best bet. That way, the seedlings will be ready to plant as soon as the first frost has passed. If you wait too long to plant your seeds, they won't have time to take hold in the soil before the summer weather gets hot. Another option is to sow seeds directly in the ground in late winter, and then allow them to come up when they are ready. Sweet pea seeds have the best chance of germinating if you help penetrate the seed shell before planting. You can do this by either soaking them in a pan of water overnight, or using a tiny knife or nail clipper to nick the surface of each seed. If you soak your seeds, only plant those that have swelled during the overnight soaking. Discard those that haven't changed in size. About 5 weeks before the last frost (usually mid-February or so), prepare small seed trays or peat containers with a seed starting mixture. Plant the seeds 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep and 3 inches (7.6 cm) apart, or in separate compartments. Water the seeds trays and cover them lightly in plastic wrap for the first week or so, to regulate the temperature. Keep them in a greenhouse or in a sunny window in a place where the temperature won't drop below 70 °F (21 °C). Once the seedlings sprout, remove the covering and keep them moist and warm until it's time to plant them just after the last frost.  If you're using seed trays, thin out the seedlings to space them 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart once they've sprouted leaves. Pinch of flowers and buds before transplanting, so the seedlings' energy can be channeled into growing new roots.",
      "Sweet peas must be kept nice and wet throughout the summer. Water them lightly every day it does not rain. Check the soil surrounding the sweet pea stems often to make sure it doesn't dry out. Sweet peas are quite prolific, and a monthly application of mild fertilizer will keep them blooming for many weeks. It's not mandatory, but it's helpful if you want to make the most of your flowers. Use compost, manure or a high-potassium commercial fertilizer application. Cutting the flowers promotes new growth, so don't hesitate to bring in some fresh blossoms or make a bouquet for a friend. Wait until the flowers have reached their fragrant and colorful peaks before cutting. You should also remove faded blossoms, which sap energy from the plant and prevent more flowers from growing. These annuals won't come back on their own next year, but you can enjoy them again if you save the seed pods and plant them again in the winter or spring, depending on where you live. This will encourage new growth in the form of more side-shoots and flowers. You can just use your fingernails to pinch off the shoots."

      "People are usually very aware of their facial expressions, but they don't necessarily realize that their bodies are sending pretty loud messages, too. She may be giving you hints that she's not interested in the way she positions her body.  If she turns her body away from you, or leans back or away from you, it's a sign she may be uncomfortable.  She keeps a barrier between you. If she always positions herself behind a chair or a table or holds her purse or backpack in front of her like a shield, she might not be interested in you.  If she walks away when she sees you or appears to be avoiding you, she is not interested and you should not try to follow. Making eye contact can actually be quite intimate, and some girls may look down or away because they are shy. But if you find that her eyes are always darting around when you talk to her, as though she's looking for her friends, she not really feeling the conversation and you should politely excuse yourself. Remember that one conversation during which she seems distracted or isn't looking at you doesn't mean she doesn't like you. But if it seems to happen every single time you try to talk to her, something is up. She's flirty and talkative during class or when you have a shift together at work. Then you run into her when she's out with her friends, and she looks right through you. If there's a huge gap between how she treats you in private and in front of her friends, she might just be flirting with you out of convenience.  She might also be too self-conscious or shy to say hello to you in front of all of her friends. Are her friends are constantly glancing at you, even if she's not? It might mean she's talked about you to her friends. Try making the first move and see how she reacts. Say hello when you see her out in public. If she seems embarrassed, is rude, or flat out ignores you, then you can be pretty sure she's not interested. Even if it's not that funny, a girl will usually laugh when a guy she likes makes a joke. Keep in mind, this is something most friends do, too, so it doesn't automatically mean she's into you. But if she doesn't even giggle at your funniest stories, you might need to find someone else who appreciates your humor. If she doesn't crack a smile at your joke, it could be because she's having a bad day (or it was a terrible joke). But if your jokes are met with silence day after day, then it's time to move on. If you ask her to the movies and she shows up with three friends, it might be a miscommunication. But if it happens every time you invite her to do something, it might be her way of letting you know she just wants to be your friend. Keep in mind some girls are not allowed to date until a certain age, and she may need her friends to tag along so her parents will let her hang out with you. But she should definitely let you know ahead of time that this won't be a solo hang.",
      "If you only hear from her when she needs help with her homework or a project, or she needs a ride somewhere, but she doesn't have time to talk to you or she's always too busy to hang out, she might be manipulating you and not truly interested in you. Relationships go two ways--one person should not always be giving or doing things for the other person and get nothing in return. While this means you two are close and she has genuine affection for you, it's unlikely she sees you as anything beyond a good friend. Saying you think of someone as a sibling is basically removing any romantic possibilities from the equation. Even if there's not a chance for romance, a girl who describes you this way definitely values your presence in her life. If you can hardly get a word in because she's talking about what she was doing last weekend, her plans for winter break, then gossiping about her friend, and she has yet to ask about your weekend, she's probably more into herself than she's into you.  If you know all the details of her life but she struggles to remember even the most basic things about you, she's likely not interested in you, but she's probably not a very good friend, either. If she doesn't ask you a lot questions about yourself but she already seems to know a lot about you, then she's probably interested in you. It's likely she's been asking her friends about you and paying attention to the sports or clubs you are involved in. Try telling her something surprising about yourself and see how she reacts.",
      "If she makes it clear that she only wants to be your friend, think about if you are okay with accepting that role in her life. If you think staying close to her and watching her possibly date other guys (and maybe even ask your advice about them) would be too painful, it's okay to say so. But if you think you can put your romantic feelings aside, be glad this rad girl wants you in her life and make the most of your friendship.  Don't stick around hoping she might change her mind. It's not fair to either of you if you are secretly hoping she'll fall for you if you do enough nice things for her. You'll be deceiving her and you'll be making yourself miserable. If you are spending all your energy trying to convince her that you're the right person for her, you may be missing out on other girls that would love to date you. You may agonize over why she doesn't like you back, and you may want to ask her to explain it to you, or convince her that she's wrong, or tell her friends to tell her you'd make an amazing couple... but you should probably cool it. If you keep pursuing her when she's not interested, you may start to annoy her or even scare her. You don't need to completely ignore her or be mean. Just take a few steps back and treat her more like an acquaintance. Just like you can't help having a crush on her, she can't force herself to have feelings for you. And while it definitely hurts, it's not the end of the world. It's completely okay to feel upset and sad when something doesn't work out. Luckily, she's not the only girl out there, and it probably won't be long until you meet someone new. Chances are the girl just thought she was treating you like a friend and wasn't trying to lead you on. Try not to hold a grudge and just move forward."

      "The onions should be grown after 60-80 days. They will, however, go rotten if you leave them ripe for too long. You will know an onion is ready when:  The onion bulb fully emerges from the soil.   The green sprouts wilt and/or turn brown. Flowers stalks appear. When the sprouts have turned to full onion bulbs that look ready for consumption, you can harvest them. Don't be scared of ripping out the roots. Handle them carefully and lay them out in a single layer to avoid bruises.This will begin the curing process and allow excess soil to fall from their skins. You can use a knife or garden scissors. This will stop the onions from decaying in storage. You will know they are cured when the foliage shrivels and the onions produce a papery outer layer. A shed or garage floor works well; anywhere that is cool, shaded and dry. The curing process will normally take around one month.  You can skip the curing process if you wish to eat the onions straight away but storing them without curing first carries a high risk of mildew and rot.  If you can't find anywhere dry enough to cure the onions, consider using a dehumidifier to keep moisture levels down.. This will ensure they remain in the right conditions and do not damage other fruit. The onions are now ready for consumption! You will want to eat the onions within a single month. If an onion sprouts, you can replant it again!",
      "Dig your fingernails into the skin at the top of the onion bulb and rip it off piece by piece. Discard the skin when you are done. The sprouts grow at the center of the onion bulb. Slice through onion’s layers vertically while avoiding the sprouts. Repeat on the other side then carefully slice off the onion's layers.  If you don’t have a knife, peel off the onion’s layers individually with your hands. You can eat the onion layers if they are firm and crisp, though make sure you wash them first! If they are soft and mushy discard them. You will likely find a few sprouts growing at the center of the onion bulb. Some will protrude from the bulb, others will not. Use your hands to gently separate the sprouts from one another so they don't need to compete for space. Given proper care, each sprout can grow into a brand new onion bulb! You can keep the sprouts in individual cups, glasses of bowls of water. Within a few days white roots will form at the bottom of each sprout.  If white roots are already present you can plant the sprouts straight into the soil. If you see dry, brown roots on a sprout, it means they are already dead. You want to wait for new white roots to form.",
      "Dig an individual hole for each sprout, and cover it so only the green part sticks out. Keep each sprout at least 3 inches apart (7.5 cm), or in separate pots, so they don't need to compete for space. Consider applying a thin layer of mulch to the soil to aid the growth process.  Whether indoors or outdoors, ensure the plants get ample sunlight. If you live in a cold climate, plant the sprouts in pot plants inside and gradually introduce them to the outdoors. The onions have been inside for some time and will need to adjust.  During the winter in cold climates keep the plants indoors at all time to ensure they stay alive.  Expect to see onion bulbs form after 60-80 days! Onions are resilient, but need plenty of water to grow. Pour a little water from a gardening can, or use a hose, on the soil around the onions, not the plant itself. Ensure the soil is well drained. If you are using mulch, the onions will only need 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water a week. As the onions grow, weeds will inevitably emerge around them. Wear garden gloves and ensure you pull the weeds out by the roots so they don't grow back. The spray will prevent harmful fungi from destroying your plants and ensure they remain healthy. A few short sprays on each plant should be enough. If you prefer not to use synthetic compounds, oxidate or copper sprays are good alternatives."

      "In particular, this applies to white-coated cats (this means cats that are entirely white) whose eyes are either both blue, both orange, or one of each color. Their deafness is linked to a fault in the \"W\"- white coat pigment gene. It is thought that 25% of these cats are totally deaf, 50% are deaf in just one ear, and 25% have normal hearing. Breeds that commonly have the W-gene include: White Oriental Shorthair, White Persian, White Exotic Shorthair, White Manx, White British Shorthair, White Devon Rex, White American Shorthair, White Cornish Rex, White American Wirehair, Foreign White, White Turkish Angora, European White, and White Scottish Fold. Just like humans, cats often experience at least a small amount of deafness as they get older.",
      "The BAER (Brainstem auditory evoked response) test monitors electrical activity in the brain that is caused by auditory stimulation (such as hearing pans banging together). This test helps a vet to see if your cat’s brain has actually registered a sound, and if one or both ears are involved. If your vet does not have BAER test equipment, ask about auditory centers that may be able to help you. Relatively few centers offer this test, so it is likely that you will need to go to a specialty center, which may be located in a different area. Three small electrodes will be attached to your cat’s head. The machine will then produce a series of clicking sounds that are generated at a range of frequencies. The electrodes will help to monitor your cat’s brain’s responses to the clicks. Good natured cats can usually go through with a short test while fully conscious. This short test only checks to see if your cat is fully deaf or not. A full hearing test that gives detailed answers as to the severity of the deafness, and whether or not both ears are affected, generally takes 20 to 30 minutes. Cats usually need to be sedated for this longer test.",
      "You may wish to consider keeping her as an indoor cat, to protect her from the hazard of traffic that she cannot hear. An alternative is to build a secure outdoor run so she has some access to fresh air, but won’t have access to any streets. Some cat owners have had good experiences using a normal, \"hearing\" cat as a playmate for the deaf cat.The body language of the hearing cat provides visual clues to the deaf cat that something has just happened. For instance, the hearing cat is aware ‘Mom has just opened the fridge door to get dinner out’ and rushes into the kitchen. The deaf cat, seeing his companion go, follows out of interest. This can work surprisingly well when one cat learns to take the lead. However, this depends on the two cats getting along, which cannot be guaranteed! Develop your own visual code for your cat, such as beckoning as a cue for your cat to come to you  (reward her compliance with a treat) or by pointing to a certain spot to get her to go there and away from trouble. Reward positive behavior with a treat and she will quickly learn to obey. You can also stamp on the floor to create vibrations.",
      "If you notice that your cat no longer wakes up and runs away when you vacuum around her, then there is a chance that she may be deaf, particularly if she always used to run away from the vacuum (or other loud gadgets). Make a noise outside of your cat's visual field (so she cannot see you). One option is to bang two pan lids together. Another option is to shake the box of cat treats that your cat loves.  The most important part is to stand somewhere your cat cannot see you. You should also avoid standing in a position where the noise you make (such as banging to pots together) does not cause a breeze to rush over your cat. If your cat turns her hear to look towards where the noise came from, or reacts in some other ways (such as becoming startled), then you will know that your cat is not completely deaf. However, you should still take your cat to a vet, as this test cannot tell you if your cat is partially deaf, or if she is deaf in one ear."

      "Each digit in a number has a name, and knowing them will help you add. Number places go from left to right:  The spot on the left is the “ones” place. The second spot from the left is the “tens” place. The third spot from the left is the “hundreds” place. Here’s an example: In the number 583, the 3 is in the ones place, the 8 is in the tens place, and the 5 is in the hundreds place. Line up your numbers so that each digit place is in a row. This makes it easier to add each column of numbers to get a final sum. If your problem is presented horizontally on a worksheet, it helps to rewrite it vertically to make it easier to solve. Each number place should be in its own line with each number stacked vertically. If one number uses fewer number spaces than another, leave the left spot blank. Here's an example:  Here’s how you’d write 16+4+342: 342 _16 +_4 The ones column is on the right. Once you have the sum of these numbers, write the ones digit of the sum in the ones place of your answer spot. If you have a tens digit in your sum, write it above the tens column in your problem. For 342+16+4, you’d add 2+6+4=12. Write the 2 in your ones place in your answer. Carry the other 1 into your tens column. If you have a number in the tens place, write the tens place number at the top of the tens column. This is the column located to the left of your ones column. You will include this number in the tens total. In the above example, you’d write the 1 from the tens place in 12 on top of the tens column. Go to the tens column, which is the next column to the left. Add up the numbers in this column, including your carry over number, if you had one. Write the ones place in this sum in the tens spot on your answer, then carry over the tens spot in your sum, if you had one. For 342+16+4, you’d add 4+1+1=6. Remember, the second 1 is the carry over from your ones sum. You’d write 6 down in the tens spot of your answer. You don’t have any carry over from this sum. For longer problems, you’ll need to add each column, moving from right to left. For each column, write the ones place of that column’s sum in the corresponding number place in the answer. Then, carry over the tens place of the sum in the next column to the left.  When you complete the last column on the right, you’ll have your final sum. In our example, you only have one number in the hundreds column, so you’d carry down the 3 to your answer. Your final sum for 342+16+4=362. Although it seems challenging, you use the same process to add decimals as you do with whole numbers. Just make sure you line up each numbers place properly, including your decimals. If a number in the problem doesn’t have a decimal, add a .0 to make it easier to workout the problem. Here’s an example:  107.8 _24.5 __3.2 +15.0",
      "Draw a line, then write numbers along the line from 0-15. Circle the first number you want to add. Start at that number. Then, count down your number line, moving the same number of spaces as the second number you’re adding. You’ll land on your answer.  Let’s say you want to add 4+5. Circle 4 on your number line, then count 5 spaces down the line. You will land on 9, which is your answer. Use your number line to add these numbers:  5+3 1+7 6+2 4+4 Start with a basic math problem, such as 4+6. Create two piles of beans to represent your problem, including one group of 4 beans and one group of 6 beans. Next, you can combine your two sets of beans to get the answer to your addition problem. Count your beans to see that you now have a total of 10 beans.  If you don’t have beans, you can use any small item that fits in your hand to practice addition! For example, you can use blocks, candies, coins, or legos. Use your beans to add these numbers:  5+3 2+7 3+9 4+1 If you were adding 7+4, you’d draw one group of 7 oranges and one group of 4 oranges. Then, count all of the oranges to see how many you have when you add them together, which is 11 oranges. This is your answer.  You can draw any object to represent your numbers, but it’s best to choose something easy. As another option, you can use stickers! Use drawing to add these numbers:  1+7 2+5 8+6 4+3",
      "Multiples of ten and one hundred are much easier to add together! Multiples of ten are easier to manage, but using hundreds can be helpful for larger numbers.  Always round up because it’s easier to keep track of how much you’re adding to your original numbers as you round. Here’s an example problem: 423+678. You’d round it like this: 430 + 680 or 500+700. You’ll need to take away the numbers you added when rounding. You can count off these numbers or simply add them in your head. Hold onto this number. In the problem listed above, you’ll count out 7 places for rounding 423 to 430 and 2 places for rounding 678 to 680. Add 7+2=9. Since you rounded, it’s easier to calculate this total in your head. However, this isn’t your final answer! For the problem above, you’d add 430+680=1110 You can use simple subtraction or count backwards from the sum of your rounded numbers. This will give you your final total! To solve the problem above, you’d subtract or count back 1110-9 =1101. When you’re adding several numbers together, you may find it easier to pair numbers together to create round numbers that end in “5” or “0,” then add those round numbers together. For example, let's say you're adding 1+8+2+7+3. You could add 8+2 = 10 and 7+3=10. That leaves you with 1+10+10=21. Break the number apart into just tens and ones. For example, 42+35+17 would become two problems: 40+30+10 and 2+5+7. It’s easy to add 40+30+10=80. Next, you’d just need to count 2+5+7=14. Finally, add your two sums together to get a final sum of 80+14=94. You can also do this with numbers in the hundreds. You can break the number down into just the hundreds, just the tens, and just the ones. However, using one of the other techniques may be easier when adding big numbers.",
      "Draw a number line, but place your zero to the far right of the line. Then, number your line toward your left using negative numbers. Mark the first negative number you want to add on the number line. Then, count out your second negative number, moving to the left. This gives you your answer. For example, let’s say you’re adding -4+-6. You’d circle -4 on your number line. Then, count 6 spaces to the left. You’ll arrive at -10, which is your answer. This is because you are moving the same number of places on the number line, just toward the negative side. This means your final answer will be negative. For example, when adding -12+-21, you could add 12+21=33. However, since your numbers were negative, you’d make your answer -33. Draw a number line with zero in the middle. Number to the left moving from -1 to -10, then number to the right 1 to 10. Circle the positive number on your number line. Then, count out your negative number to find the answer, moving to the left on your number line. For instance, let’s say you’re adding 6+-8. You’ll circle 6 on your number line. Then, count 8 spaces backwards, moving to the left on your line. You’ll arrive at -2, which is your answer. Adding a negative number with a positive number works just like subtraction. This is because you’re taking away spaces on the number line. When you’re solving a problem on paper, you can write it out like a subtraction problem. For example, 15+-17 would become 15-17=-2."

      "A last is a block in the shape of a human foot shoemakers use to guide their work. To do this, you'll want to make a cast mould of your foot; that way, the shoes you'll be making will be custom-fitted for you personally. Get a box filled with an alginate jelly and place your foot in, ideally up to the ankle. Let your foot rest for 20 minutes while the jelly solidifies, then slowly remove your foot.   Make sure to remove your foot slowly; you don't want to damage anything once it solidifies. It's highly recommended you do this for both feet at the same time. The idle time is best to get over with early on in the process. One positive thing to mention about this step in the process is that you can ideally reuse these lasts for each subsequent pair of shoes you try to make. Make a point of keeping them somewhere safe, where they don't run the risk of being broken. Now that there's a proper mould of your foot, you can pour casting material into it. Depending on the type and quality of casting material, the solidifying time could take anywhere from half an hour to overnight. Be patient-- it may be a good time at this point to work on other parts of the process if your plans are settled enough. Once the last has solidified, it's time to take it out and get it ready. Cover your last with a colourless masking tape. That will keep it from being damaged as easily, and you'll be able to draw your designs directly on the last. Outline your design on the last itself. Before you get to putting the pieces together, you'll probably find it helpful to give the last an outline of what you want the shoe to look like around it. While you shouldn't rely on it for concrete measurements, having an idea of what it will look like in three dimensions will help as you're figuring out where each stitch should go.",
      "If you're planning on making a shoe, it's undoubtedly important you have some idea what kind of shoe you would like to make. Shoes are incredibly diverse, and there are plenty of types you can make, not limited to loafers, sneakers, sandals, boots and high heels. Try to imagine what kind of shoe style would suit your individual style the most.  It may be helpful to sketch out a few ideas. Manifesting your ideas with an illustration can come a long way towards planning out your shoe. If you're new to shoe making, it's probably best to stick to something simple. A basic laced shoe goes without some of the finesse of more complicated types, and you can still add plenty of flair to a basic formula. Before you think about making your shoe, it's important you have an accurate and well-detailed set of plans to work on. After all, you don't want to be making design decisions on the go; shoemaking is a very precise business, and the slightest mishap could keep the shoe from turning out well.  Basic shoe templates are available on the internet. Do a search and look up some 'recipes'. If nothing else, it might give you inspiration for your own design. Online art outlets like www.etsy.com may have more elaborate shoe templates for sale. Designing your own is only recommended if you've made a shoe before. If that's what you're ultimately looking to do, try stitching together something basic with a free template, and put that experience towards making your own the second time around. You can save yourself a lot of time and give your shoes a more professional look if you harvest parts from other shoes you don't use anymore. In particular, shoe soles are good as they'll give you a reference for the rest of your stitching. Provided they're in good enough shape, you should salvage the parts you think might work in your new shoe, taking care to remove them slowly and carefully with a scalpel knife. While specific lists of ingredients will depend on the certain type of shoe you're looking to make, it generally goes without saying that you'll want a few sheets of good leather and a firm fabric.  If you don't have a sewing and stitching kit, you'll need to buy or borrow one to make your shoes. Rubber, leather and fabrics are all good for the chassis of the shoes. While its recommended that shoe soles be taken from old shoes or bought as pre-fabricated supplies, you can make a functional and waterproof sole using a few sheets of cork. Each sheet need not be more than 1/8 inches thick. Remember to get at least twice as much as you think, so you'll have enough to make a pair!",
      "A leather-based shoe will own  with its own natural waterproofing abilities, but you're going to want to do everything you can to make sure water isn't able to get in. Getting a relatively inexpensive sealant spray and give your shoes a thorough going-over is a smart idea, especially if you live in a wetter part of the world. Let's face it; most of the time you're making something from home, it's because you want to put your own unique spin on it. You have plenty of chance to do so even after the shoe is made.   Taking a leather paint and adding an inventive design to the sides of the shoes is a fun and effective way to add style to your creation.   There are countless ways you can stylize your shoes. Look online for some ideas if you're in need of inspiration. Now that your spiffy creations are finally finished, it's time for the defining moment of trying them on and putting them to use. Try walking down the hallway or the street and get a hang for the way they feel. Are they comfortable? Do you think they could keep out water if you accidentally stepped in a puddle? If this is your first time making shoes, it's perfectly normal for there to be issues. If you're not satisfied with the end result, you can always put the expertise you've gained to good use and make another pair.  If it's just the insole that's uncomfortable, you can buy gel-based insoles (like Dr. Scholl's) to give your feet some much-welcomed cushion.",
      "Using your template or personal design, cut each necessary section of fabric or leather out using a surgical knife or scalpel. You may find it helpful to use a ruler or protractor to help you with the incisions. While cutting your pattern, you should leave at least an inch of extra material along the bottom edge of the shoe, as well as a centimetre or so, where the different pieces of the upper join together. This will be your seam allowance. A fluid stitch is one of the most skill-testing parts of making your own shoe. Be meticulous and slow as you're piecing it together; while it may be easier to go faster, bad stitching will certainly show in the final product, and your shoe won't look as good as it should. Try to get the stitches as close to the end of each piece of fabric as you can. Overlaps might leave unnecessary ridges on the shoe. If you intentionally cut your pieces to be slightly bigger than necessary for the sake of having stitching space, remember to take that into account. You don't want to end up with a shoe that's too big, or too small for the sole. While fabric won't be any problem to stitch through, you may have an issue with leather. Leather is notoriously sturdy, and you won't be able to stitch it fluidly. Rather, it's recommended you punch holes in it before connecting it to your other pieces. Eyelets are the holes you'll need to fix your laces through. Chances are your shoe design will use these. Evenly space the eyelets apart from one another (just less than an inch, in most cases) and offer enough of them (4-5) to encase most of the laces. If you're the DIY type, you can make these incisions with a scalpel easily enough. If you're going for a more professional-looking product however, there are specific eyelet-making tools you can order from a specialty outlet. If you purchased a pre-fabricated sole or nabbed a pair from old shoes, you won't need to worry about this step. If you're trying to make a purely homemade set of shoes however, picking up a few sheets of cork is your best bet. Cork has a comfortable amount of cushion, and it's waterproof.  If you have the fabric stitched together already, you can use that as a point of reference while making your incisions, although you should ultimately rely on the empirical measurements laid out in your template. Your last should come in handy here as well. Cut the sole out of the cork sheet, leaving a little extra space around the last so your foot will ultimately have some breathing room. If you're wanting some extra cushion and height, you can add a second or even third layer of cork to your sole. Just cut it out in the exact same dimensions, and superglue the layers together. Give the glued cork soles some time to solidify once you've finished gluing them. You can make a shoe heel by adding an extra layer to the posterior third of the sole. Stitching the fabric to your sole won't work, at least not by itself. It's recommended you pick up a shoe-specific adhesive to glue your fabric to the sole. Apply the glue slowly and evenly. This will maximize the waterproof seal for your shoe, and keep it sturdy. If your blueprint suggests any additional stitches, do those as well.  Make use of the last inside the shoe as you're putting it together. It will make a great point of reference and support while you're getting the tricky stitches done. If you're a real pro with stitches, don't be afraid to spice up your stitching style. Stitches themselves can be an interesting aesthetic tool. If you're feeling more daring than the rest of us, you can experiment with irregular stitching patterns, so long as they're fundamentally sturdy enough to do their practical job. By this point, you should have relatively functional shoe. Add laces through the eyelets if you haven't already. To make the shoe look as good as it can be, you'll want to trim the excess fabric. If there are some really ugly seam marks on the shoe, you can add a new layer of leather or fabric to cover it up. Now that you have the body of the shoe, you can start thinking about adding more aesthetic flair to it. It's generally assumed you'll want to make two shoes to wear at the same time. After the basics of the first shoe are done, it's time to move onto the second. Keep in mind that you're not wanting to make a copy, but a mirror image of your original shoe. Try to keep it looking as close to the first as you possibly can. Any possible slip ups you made on the first will look worse if they're not reflected on the other shoe. If you were frustrated making the first shoe, you should find making the second is a lot more enjoyable."

      "If you feel your boyfriend is being disrespectful, learn to assert yourself. In the moment the disrespect occurs, let him know you will not tolerate it. You do not have to be aggressive or mean. Simply state your needs in a calm fashion   When your boyfriend is being difficult, say so in the moment. Calmly let him know what he's saying is not respectful and you don't appreciate it. Do this in a calm fashion to avoid escalating the argument. For example, your boyfriend is on your case about you going out with friends from work because he feels these friends are not responsible. Say something like, \"I appreciate your concerns, but I know how to stay safe. I'm allowed to have a social life and I need you to respect that.\" If your boyfriend is chronically disrespectful, he may not always listen when you assert yourself. Instead of hearing your needs and backing off, he may become hostile or even aggressive. For example, \"I don't care what you think you need. I don't want you going out with those girls from the office.\" In this case, just walk away.  You need to back up your words with behavior. If you want your boyfriend to respect your social life, and he isn't, show him you won't tolerate this lack of respect. Say something like, \"You're not listening to me and this isn't getting us anywhere. I'm going for a walk.\" Then, leave for a few hours to give your boyfriend a chance to calm down. Living with a chronically disrespectful person can drain your self esteem. You may start to feel you are not worth things like love and respect. This is not the case. Everyone has worth, so remind yourself of yours when necessary.  Most people have some areas in their lives they could use to improve. However, this does not mean you don't deserve love or respect. Just because you're, say, a little messy does not give your boyfriend the right to yell at or berate you constantly. Remind yourself of of this. Adopt a personal mantra. Try something like, \"I matter. I deserve respect. I deserve love.\" If someone keeps disrespecting you, you don't have to stay in the relationship. If you consistently feel controlled, uncomfortable, or unhappy with someone, the relationship is probably not worth your time. There's nothing wrong with walking away if someone is not respecting you.",
      "No one is perfect. It's normal for a romantic partner to sometimes point out your flaws if they affect him or the relationship. However, a disrespectful partner will lecture you constantly about even minor, inconsequential flaws. He will also sound less concerned and more demeaning.  In a respectful relationship, your boyfriend may say something like, \"Could you not text as much while we watch TV? I just like to have you present.\" If your boyfriend is being disrespectful, his reaction will be more over the top. Instead of asking nicely that you don't text during certain times, he will lash out and start lecturing you about your flaws. For example, \"This just shows how you can't concentrate on anything. I think this is why you've been having so much trouble at school lately. Your professors are probably as frustrated with you as I am.\" A disrespectful boyfriend is often very controlling and domineering in his behavior. During interactions, you  may feel your boyfriend will not let you have your way. He may have an \"It's my way or the highway\" mentality, and act out when things don't go the way he wants.  A disrespectful boyfriend may, for example, take major issue with you seeing friends without him. He may berate you and question this decision, saying things like, \"Your friends are so boring. Why do you need to see them so much?\" While he may not directly forbid you from going, he may do things to make your night difficult. For example, he allows you to see a movie with your friend Maggie, but texts and calls the whole time in the theater. He may also let you grab coffee with a friend, but cold shoulder you when you get home. Compromise is important to any healthy relationship. Your boyfriend should occasionally be willing to meet your needs, just as you've met his. You may feel like you always end up doing things your partner's way, whether you want to or not.  In a normal relationship, people compromise on things like taste. You may, for example, go see a movie you don't really want to see, but then eat dinner at your favorite restaurant afterwards. With a disrespectful boyfriend, everything will be about him. If you try to say \"No\" or offer a compromise, he simply berates you until he gets his way. For example, he wants to go hiking for your anniversary. You're not much of a hiker, but propose a short, easy hike as you've never gone before. Instead of agreeing, he keeps complaining that he loves long hikes and a short hike will be boring for him until you eventually agree to go on the shorter hike. Is your boyfriend quick to anger? Does he create a generally hostile atmosphere in your home? If you feel unsafe when around him, and feel as if you need to walk on eggshells constantly, he may be disrespecting you. A chronically disrespectful person will not own up to the fact his behavior has hurt others. Most people apologize for their shortcomings or try to change them. A disrespectful person will never take full responsibility for himself.  Your boyfriend may refuse to apologize for even little things. For example, he's consistently late but is always making excuses such as \"There was traffic\" and \"I was stressed, so I lost track of time.\" He may also make excuses for major aspects of disrespect. For example, \"I'm sorry I yelled at you, but you don't get the pressure I've been under lately.\" He may even go as far as to blame you. For example, \"I would be more respectful about you seeing your friends if I felt more valued in the relationship.\"",
      "If your boyfriend is disrespectful, you often won't feel like you're being heard in the relationship. Do you feel like your boyfriend truly understands you? Do you think he knows your needs and wants? If not, he may be disrespecting you.  You may feel like your boyfriend does not know basic things about you, such as personal boundaries and what you like to do. This may be because he talks over you or dismisses you. Listening is a basic sign of respect. Someone who does not listen to you does not likely respect you. Think about how you feel about your role in the relationship. Disrespectful people will often make their partners feel unworthy. In a healthy relationship, you will feel you deserve love and respect.  You may find yourself consistently having thoughts like, \"I don't deserve him\" or \"It's my fault he yells. I don't deserve to be treated well.\" You do deserve respect. Every human deserve as much. If you consistently feel unworthy of basic aspects of respect (being listened to, being treated with kindness, having your needs met, etc.) then your boyfriend may be being disrespectful towards you. Disrespectful people can create toxic relationships with those around them. If you're being perpetually disrespected, think about your overall energy level. Do you feel tired most of the time? Do you feel drained and exhausted? If so, your boyfriend may be disrespecting you. A disrespectful partner can affect how you behave. If you're with someone who doesn't respect you, you may often feel like you're at your worst.  Do you feel like you're not the person you used to be? Do you feel like you're no longer able to keep up with things like your friends, hobbies, and social life and are just doing the bare minimum? Do you feel like you're not dealing as well in social interactions? Maybe you've been more short tempered or dismissive lately. This is a sign you're not being respected and lashing out at others."

      "After you have chosen the right parcel of land for your purposes, you will need to have the land surveyed to determine its dimensions and property lines. A survey will also reveal any easements for access to the property, which refers to neighbor's rights to travel through the property. Right-of-way issues are often critical to open plots of land because they are important for the purposes of improving or using that land over time and may affect your ability to get a loan. For more information on having land surveyed, see how to get a land survey. In some cases you may be able to simply ask for a recent land survey from the seller. Go to municipal offices and look through zoning records to get a better idea of how a desired plot of land could be legally used. If your intended use for the land is not allowed by zoning laws, you may be able to apply to seek a zoning change from the municipal government. You may also wish to secure any flood or hazard warnings relevant to the land. A potential lender may ask for these documents. Improvements are any existing or planned man-made additions to the plot of land. Adding improvements to the land or detailing planned improvements for the land may help you secure financing.  It may be easier to secure financing if you plan to build structures on the land. These could be residential or commercial structures, depending on your needs and zoning laws. In order to secure financing more easily, have an architect draw up plans for whatever kind of structure you want to build. You may also wish to contact a general contractor for an estimated cost of building the structure. Note that 100% financing packages are rarely available for raw land, even those expected to be developed. Lenders will expect you to have a stake in the financing as well. Whether a piece of land is close to water and sewer utilities may affect its value. Other types of access may also make a huge difference in valuation, and may affect a financing deal. If there are no utilities already installed on the land, contact the utility companies that service the area for an installation estimate.  Even if there is no building on the land, existing wells, trails, roads or other items may increase the perceived value of the parcel. Any perceived improvement in value will make financing easier to get. Perhaps the most common one for unimproved land is timber value. Sellers and buyers often identify timber value for a piece of forested land in land calculations. This value may also influence a financing deal by convincing the lender that you will be able to profit from the land. Grazing or farming rights may be another way to earn money on a piece of land. You'll need to put the information about the land and your plans for it together in a sort of loan application, sometimes known as a land portfolio. The more information you have, the better \"story\" you will be able to tell the lender and the higher your chances of securing financing. Your land portfolio should also include information about your creditworthiness (like a credit report or score).",
      "Before taking any action, especially if you are purchasing completely raw land, consider hiring professional legal help. Hiring a real estate attorney will ensure that your rights are protected during the bidding process for purchasing the land and during the financing process. A good attorney will also be able to help you with price negotiations. Before you can purchase your property, you will need to make an offer on the land and have that offer accepted by the seller. This process can be very simple, but can also follow a relatively complicated bidding process. For more information on the actual buying process for land, see How to Buy Raw Land. It may also be in your best interest to ask for an exclusive option on the property for a period of time so you can pursue financing, etc. Having an option is better than owning, since there is less money involved. Before submitting an offer on the land, be sure that you have the proper permits and any requisite insurance. Ask your lawyer for assistance in this matter. If your offer is accepted by seller, you now will have to find a way to finance your purchase. Start by contacting potential lenders like local banks and credit unions to request a loan interview. Meet with these lenders and present your land portfolio. With enough salesmanship and good credit, along with a good land portfolio, you might be able to get a loan through one of these institutions. With some land types, especially raw land parcels, it may be very difficult to secure funding from a financial institution. Luckily, there are a bevy of other financing options available. The land serves as collateral for loan; additional security might come from downpayment in place of other assets. Be aware that some financing options may be more expensive than borrowing from the bank, so consider your options before setting down any of the following paths.  One option is owner financing. This essentially allows you to gradually pay the seller of property directly, rather than going through a lending institution. This will generally require a large down payments to secure the trust of the seller. Like any bank loan, owner financing will be secured by legal documents. Contact the seller of the property to see if they are willing to do this financing option.  Another option is through a private-party loan. This will require you to find a friend or family member willing to loan you money. These loans can be secured with collateral (the lender takes possession of a house or car if you default) or unsecured.  Additionally, if the land is being purchased for a specific purpose, like for farming or commercial use, you may be able to apply for government loans. Specifically, the Small Business Administration (SBA) offers loans specifically designed for the purpose of purchasing land and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers land loans to farmers who fail to qualify for traditional loans. See their respective websites or contact your local SBA or USDA offices to learn more. Estimate the total costs of each loan and compare them against each other. Generally, owner financing will be the cheapest option, unless you have great credit and are able to secure a low-interest bank loan. Also think about the durations of the loans; you don't want to take a great interest rate but be stuck paying it off for many years. Choose a loan that you can afford and, if you're utilizing your land for profit, one that will allow you to earn money in the long run. Select which loan works best for you and pay the down payment. Be advised that in many cases, this down payment may be as high as 20 to 50 percent of the value of the property."

      "to exercise your glutes, hamstrings, and quads. Stand straight with your feet slightly apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing towards your body. Slightly bend your legs, lowering the weights down in front of your body until they reach your knees. Slowly rise back to a standing position. Do about 2-3 sets of 6-12 reps each if you are using heavier weights and 12-15 repetitions if you are using lighter weights. Lie back on a bench and position yourself under a racked barbell. Plant your feet flat on the ground. Arch your back slightly to keep a neutral spine. Grip the bar tightly and push up to remove the bar from the rack. Slowly lower the bar towards your chest before pushing up again. Do 2-3 sets of 6-12 repetitions each if you want to build muscle. Aim for 2-3 sets of 12-15  reps if you want to work on endurance. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grasp a dumbbell in each hand, with your arms straight down in front of your body. With your knees slightly bent and your back straight, lean forward while keeping your abs tight and your chest facing down. Bend your elbows to pull the dumbbells up until your  shoulders squeeze together. Hold for a second before slowly lowering them back down. With heavier weights, repeat this exercise 6-12 times for 2-5 sets. If you use lighter weights, go for 2-3 sets of 12-15 repetitions. Hold the dumbbell at shoulder height with your arm bent. This is the starting position. Slowly extend your arm up until it is straight. Keep your shoulder down while you do this; do not lift it towards your ear. Hold this pose for a second before slowly lowering it down to starting position. With heavier weights, repeat this exercise 6-12 times on each arm for 2-5 sets. With lighter weights, do 2-3 sets of 12-15 reps for each arm. Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lower yourself by bending your knees, but keep your back straight. Your knees should be straight over your toes. Once your thighs are parallel to the ground, rise back up slowly to a standing position.  You can hold the dumbbells straight out in front of your or straight down your sides. Don't move your arms as you squat. Do 2-3 sets of 6-12 repetitions if you are using heavy weights. Aim for 2-3 sets of 12-15  reps if you are using light weights. Squats will work your glutes, hamstrings, quads, and adductors. While standing, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Step forward with 1 leg while keeping the other leg back. As you do this, lower your hips towards the floor.  Your knees should be bent at 90-degree angles. Move your legs back into a standing position. Do 2-3 sets of 6-12 repetitions with heavy weights or 2-3 sets of 12-15  reps with light weights.",
      "Do not lift weights too often, or you could injure yourself. Your muscles need time to repair after a session of lifting weights. Generally, 2 days of rest in between weight-lifting sessions will give you enough time to rest and repair before you use weights again. When you do work out, go with compound strength training exercises for an effective way to lose fat. These are exercises that work out multiple muscle groups at once. No matter what type of weight you choose, you will burn calories. That said, if you want to build muscle, you should choose heavier weights. Pick weights that are heavy, but not so heavy that you can't complete a full set.  If you want to build endurance, go for lighter weights.  If you are using heavier weights, you should do fewer repetitions to help you build muscle. Doing 6-12 repetitions in a set is a good guideline. If you are using lighter weights for endurance, do more repetitions in a set. Aim for 12-15 repetitions per set.  Repetitions (or reps) are the number of times you repeat an exercise. A set contains a certain number of repetitions that you do before you rest. Resting allows you to catch your breath, but if you are trying to lose weight, avoid resting for too long. Keep your breaks to no more than a minute. If you need longer to rest, your weights may be too heavy. To get the most out of weight lifting, you need to make sure you have proper form. When learning a new technique, practice with no weights first to master the form. Improper form can lead to injuries, and it will reduce the benefits you receive from lifting weights.  Use online videos, bodybuilding blogs, and sports training websites to help you learn the proper form of any move you want to learn. At your gym, you can ask for a personal trainer to teach you the proper form of new exercises. As time goes on and you get stronger, you can increase the weights that you lift to help build more muscle and burn more fat. Gradually add on weight in 1–5 pounds (0.45–2.27 kg) increments to make sure that you don't overdo it. Lifting weights can help you build muscle and burn calories, but cardio is still useful when trying to lose fat. There are many ways that you can incorporate cardio into a weight-lifting routine. Choose a program that works for you.  Start your workout with a 10-minute run on the treadmill, bike ride, or elliptical session. At the end of the workout, do another 10 minutes to cool down. Do 5 minutes of cardio in between weight lifting sets. Jump on the treadmill, elliptical, or stationary bike. Do a full 30-45 minute cardio routine 2-3 times a week. Do these on days when you don't lift weights.",
      "Use an online calorie tracker like SuperTracker or an app like My Fitness Pal to watch what you eat each day. Record how many calories are in each serving of food or drink. Also add the number of calories you burned from exercise.  To lose fat, you must burn more calories than you eat. You need to burn 3,500 calories to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fat. To make this more manageable, aim for a calorie deficit of 500 calories a day. Keep in mind that muscle weighs more than fat. As you build muscle, you may become heavier, but you may still be losing fat. Protein can help you build and maintain muscle, but your diet shouldn't be more than 35% protein.  You should eat about .37 grams of protein for every 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body weight. Protein-rich foods include eggs, meats, fish, and cottage cheese. For example, you might eat scrambled eggs in the morning, a peanut butter sandwich for lunch, and grilled chicken for dinner. Carbohydrates can give you energy while you lift weights. The best carbs are complex carbs, which also give you fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Complex carbs include whole grains, oatmeal, lentils, and beans. Avoid simple carbs, like sugar, baked goods, white rice, pasta, and soda. Carbs should make up between 45-65% of your diet. Fats should make up 20-30% of your diet. Look for healthy fats (known as unsaturated fats), such as olive oil, fish, nuts, and avocados. Avoid saturated fats, like fried food, margarine, and fatty meats. Muscle weighs more than fat. If you build muscle, you may weigh more, even if you are shedding fat. Body fat measurements are a better way to check your progress. Some common measurements include:   Using body calipers at home or at a gym. Using a body fat scale or monitor at a gym or doctor's office. Undergoing water displacement at a large hospital or health facility. Getting a DEXA scan from a doctor or health spa."

      "Completing a Character Sheet"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Make sure you have a basic overview of your character before you start to draw them. Ideally, complete a character sheet so you know exactly who they are. If you don’t want to be this detailed, decide their role in the story and their basic physical traits.  A basic concept for Alice might be, “Short dark-haired witch in a black dress who’s the hero of the story.” For Trixy, you might write, “Tall, red-headed witch in jeans and yellow t-shirt who’s secretly a villain.” How your character stands says a lot about their personality. Think about how your character would hold their body based on their personality and goals. Then, picture what their silhouette would look like. Use this to create an outline of your character.  For example, Alice might be standing tall with her hand on her hip and her nose pointed in the air. Trixy, on the other hand, might be looking down and off to the side. Her hands might pressed together in front of her body to show that she’s hiding something. Quickly sketch out the basic look you’re going for with this character. Do a couple of sketches so you can try different details and angles. Then, review your sketches to help you decide how you want to draw the character.  Sketching also helps you warm up so it’s easier to draw. Don’t worry about making mistakes. These sketches should be loose and don’t need to be finished. What your character wears should show something about them as a character. This includes the type of clothing they wear, the colors they pick, and the accessories they choose. Think about how your character would dress, then create an outfit that works for them.  For example, Alice might wear flowing dresses because she thinks it better reflects her witch heritage. Similarly, she might stick to dark colors because it makes her feel witchy. For accessories, she might wear an old locket that has her grandmother’s picture in it. Trixy might wear modern clothes because she doesn’t follow the old ways. Additionally, she might choose bright colors because it makes people think she’s happy, even though she’s not. For accessories, she might carry a purse that’s made from a pet fox that she once had. Now that you’ve decided on the posture and basic physical features, create a drawing of your character. Do this on paper or your computer, depending on what’s comfortable for you. Make this drawing as detailed as you’d like.  You might be able to use a drawing app to help you create your character. If you’re using the drawing as inspiration but don’t plan to show it to people, don’t worry if it’s not perfect. Just do your best. If you’re creating a comic book or something similar, practice drawing your character over and over. This will help you get good at it, so don’t give up!",
      "Make a list of questions you could ask your character, or look for a list online. Then, go through the list and answer each question as your character. Base the answers on your character’s background, their personality, and what they want.  Questions might include, “What’s your favorite food?” “Do you have a pet?” “What is your relationship like with your family?” “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” “What is your earliest memory?” “What is your dream job?” “Who is your most trusted confidant?” and “What’s in your bedroom?” As an example, Alice might say that her favorite food is homemade kettle corn because she likes the salty-sweet taste. She might also say that she has a black cat and an orange cat that act as her familiars. Give your character an accent or speech pattern that shows their background or personality. Additionally, use words and sentence structures that reflect your character's level of education and place in society. This will help your audience learn more about your character through their speech. As an example, Alice might include old fashioned words in her speech and may occasionally rhyme due to her experience making spells. She might say things like, \"The forest has darkened a wee bit early, but that's no reason for you to get surly.\" You can learn a lot from a person by watching how they go about their life. This includes activities like cooking, eating, cleaning, driving a car, or talking to a receptionist. Explore how your character acts in these moments to help their character development.  For instance, Alice might clean her house and cook her breakfast using a spell. Then, you might have her struggle to purchase items at a store because she can’t use her magic there. This shows that she overly relies on her magic. As another example, you might show Alice trying to check out a magic book from the library. She might blush and mumble when she talks to the clerk and have trouble making eye contact. This shows that she’s shy. Real people have opinions, so your character should, as well. Consider which issues in your story will be most important to your character. Then, decide what your character’s opinion on that issue would be. Use this opinion to help with character development. For instance, Alice might believe that witches should live separately from non-magical humans. This might make it hard for her to work with humans. Additionally, it might create conflict between her and other witches. Show your character interacting with their family, friends, or an antagonist. Make sure that each character is distinctive so that you see the similarities and differences between them. This helps you better understand what your OC is about and who they really are. As an example, let’s say Alice has a best friend named Trixy. You might have a scene where Alice and Trixy come across an injured witch in the woods. Alice might stop and help the witch, offering him her last bit of water and food. Trixy might roll her eyes and tell Alice that she’s wasting her time by helping. Then, Trixy might go to get help but return really late because she took a break to do something fun. This shows that Alice is kind and helpful, while Trixy might be unreliable. To make your story interesting, you have to give your character problems and deny them what they want. Create obstacles and losses for your character that keeps them striving to get what they want. This helps them develop as a character and keeps your audience rooting for the character. For example, Alice might almost find her parents but them they get moved again. Similarly, she might realize that her best friend Trixy is secretly helping the person who took her parents.",
      "This includes their name, age, birth place, where they live, and their basic personal details, such as their species and sex or gender if they have one. List as many details that you can think of right now. It’s okay if you don’t know everything yet.  You could write, “Alice, 25, born at home, lives in a small rural town called Wisty, human witch, female, has magic.” If you’re not sure about a detail, leave a blank space for it so that you can come back later. Sometimes it takes time to really understand a character. Every character should have a function in the story you’re telling. Consider what your OC is going to contribute to the story, then assign them a basic role. It’s okay if you go back and change this later, but it’s good to have an idea.  For instance, your character might be the hero, the villain, the femme fatale, the wise elder, the romancer, or the helper. As an example, a female character who uses her looks to hide the fact that she’s a dangerous thief might be a femme fatale. It’s okay if your character has more than 1 role. For instance, a male character who falls in love while rescuing a city might be both a hero and a romancer. Ask yourself how your character will look. Then, describe their basic physical features, how they typically dress, and how they move and stand. Be as detailed as you want to be at this stage. You can always add more details later. You might write, “Alice is short, curvy, and has pale skin. Her hair is black and curly, and her eyes are grey with yellow sparkles. She usually wears black, royal blue, or dark purple clothes, typically dresses. Her hands are scarred from potions accidents, and she has a scar on her chest from a spell that went wrong. She’s proud of her witch heritage, so she always stands up straight and walks with her chin slightly lifted.” Describe your character's past and how it’s brought them to this point in the story. Discuss what they’ve done as well as things that have happened to them. Include the major details that shaped them as a character. For instance, “Alice has always lived in a small town and feels like she’s the most talented witch in her family. Her parents home schooled her and taught her the old ways of her family, so she’s not familiar with modern society. She’s always tried really hard to learn new spells, to the point that she annoyed her family members. Her parents have always supported her and built up her self-esteem, but it’s made her have too much confidence in her abilities. Now, her parents have disappeared and she needs to find them, but her overconfidence is causing her to make mistakes.” Think of 5-10 traits that are really important to your character. Include the talents they might possess, like singing, running fast, or casting spells. Then, consider what types of achievements they might make, as well as what would make them proud.  Decide their overall attitude. For instance, are they an optimist, a pessimist, or a realist? Alice’s personal traits might include that she's hardworking, determined, quick thinking, creative, friendly, and loyal. Her talents might include making potions, casting spells, and singing. For achievements, you might include that she brewed her first potion at age 5, she won a magical pie baking contest, and she’s the rightful possessor of her family’s spell book. It’s tempting to make your character perfect, but this makes them seem fake. Everyone has flaws, so consider what your character’s flaws might be. This can include bad personality traits, physical imperfections, or mistakes that they’ve made. Describe these flaws in your character sheet. Alice’s personality flaws might include being overconfident, being naive, and acting without thinking. Her physical imperfections might include her scars, the fact that she runs slowly, and the fact that she’s physically weak. Her mistake might be that she’s trusted the wrong person to help her. Everyone is afraid of something, so fear helps make your character more real. Additionally, it gives you something to threaten them with in a story. Identify what might scare your character the most and include it on their character sheet. For instance, Alice might be afraid of losing her parents forever. Additionally, she may be afraid to leave her home town, even though she must if she wants to find her parents. Every character needs to have a motivation, which is typically tied to what they want. This is what drives the story forward. Think about what your character would logically want most, then explain this in your character sheet.  If you already know the plot of your story, use this to figure out your character’s motivation. What is the core conflict in your plot? What is your character missing? This is likely their motivation. In Alice’s story, her motivation might be to get her parent’s back. Additionally, she probably wants to prove herself as a talented witch."

Check with any poster size requirements for your event. You may have space limitations for your display, and sometimes your poster size may be restricted. Be sure you have adequate supplies to display your poster. Usually, display stands or clips may be provided for you on site, but it is best to check ahead to make sure you bring everything you need. Many students try to include everything in their research paper, but this is a serious mistake. You can leave off the abstract and large areas of text tend to dissolve into visually cramped, boring, gray spaces that are intimidating to an audience. Posters that have too much text on them will be passed over in favor of those that are easier to read.  Highlight the key details and share the extraneous details verbally. Use columns to organize and structure your presentation in a logical manner.  Clearly label any sections, graphs or images. If you know how to use Powerpoint, Keynote or design programs like Photoshop, you can make some stunning visual aids that can combine your text and graphics into a professional looking display.  Once you've created all your sections and illustrations, transfer the files to portable document format (PDF) so you can be certain how they will look when printed. Use either PC or Mac platform for everything so you don't run into compatibility problems when moving files between the two. Check your graphs, charts and other illustrations to make sure a reader can make out the details at that distance. Take another couple steps back. Your poster title should be readable from 10 feet (3 m) away.  Use a large font for all text. Paragraph text should be between 18-24 pt. font. You can use a different font style for titles to help distinguish them, but otherwise, you should keep the font consistent.  Use color to attract the eyes of your audience. 2-3 colors can help your various titles to stand out. Avoid adding too many, though, so it doesn't become overwhelming. Avoid using 3D illustrations unless it's absolutely necessary. If you do use 3D illustrations, print stereoscopic versions on the poster and provide readers with 3D glasses. Don't settle for poor-quality images. Go to the trouble of finding image files that will still look sharp when blown up to place on your photo. You may have to take your own digital photos. There are a number of ways to do this, from using the devices found inside recordable greeting cards to attaching your personal media player to your poster. You can place a quick response (QR) code on your poster that readers with smartphones and similar devices can scan to access a website that will show photographs, play sound files or display other media on their devices. Place your information so it is in an easy to follow sequential order. Evaluate how the information is organized and if the poster is visually appealing. Ask for feedback from fellow students and teachers. Use the feedback to create the final version. You may want to purchase a cardboard tube to store and protect your poster until your presentation. You don't want all your hard work to go to waste. If you don't want to purchase a container, consider rolling the poster up and wrapping a rubber band loosely around each end to keep it closed until your presentation. You can use a local printing service or find one online that specializes in creating scientific posters.  If you are traveling to a scientific gathering, you can have a printing service create your poster and have it waiting for you when you arrive. Conference organizers often make agreements with printing services to make and deliver posters as a courtesy to students. If you plan to use a poster printer at your university, see if they have a place to sign up. During crunch time, many people may be trying to print off their work. For many events, a presenter should be present to answer client questions or give additional information as needed. It's a good idea to have a sign on hand in case you need to step away to get a drink or use the restroom. This can help reduce the chance you miss any interested visitors. A good poster may still not include every bit of relevant information. You should be prepared to answer any questions with all your available information. Bring note cards that you can refer to in a pinch. You may also want to get a binder to carry along any other information that might be requested. Practice your presentation multiple times before taking it to the public. This will make you more confident and engage the listeners."

      "Formatting Your SOP",
      "Writing Your SOP",
      "Ensuring Success and Accuracy"
    ],
    "document": [
      "There is no right or wrong way to write an SOP. However, your company probably has a number of SOPs you can refer to for formatting guidelines, outlining how they prefer it done. If that's the case, use the pre-existing SOPs as a template. If not, you have a few options:   A simple steps format. This is for routine procedures that are short, have few possible outcomes, and are fair to the point. Apart from the necessary documentation and safety guidelines, it's really just a bullet list of simple sentences telling the reader what to do.  A hierarchical steps format. This is usually for long procedures -- ones with more than ten steps, involving a few decisions to make, clarification and terminology. This is usually a list of main steps all with substeps in a very particular order.   A flowchart format. If the procedure is more like a map with an almost infinite number of possible outcomes, a flowchart may be your best bet. This is the format you should opt for when results aren't always predictable. There are three main factors to take into account before writing your SOP:   Your audience's prior knowledge. Are they familiar with your organization and its procedures? Do they know the terminology? Your language needs to match the knowledge and investment of the reader.   Your audience's language abilities. Is there any chance people who don't speak your language will be \"reading\" your SOP? If this is an issue, it's a good idea to include lots of annotated pictures and diagrams.  The size of your audience. If multiple people at once are reading your SOP (those in different roles), you should format the document more like a conversation in a play: user 1 completes an action, followed by user 2, and so on and so forth. That way, each reader can see how he or she is an integral cog in the well-oiled machine. What it boils down to is this: Are you the best person to be writing this? Do you know what the process entails? How it could go wrong? How to make it safe? If not, you may be better off handing it over to someone else. A poorly-written -- or, what's more, inaccurate -- SOP will not only reduce productivity and lead to organizational failures, but it can also be unsafe and have adverse impacts on anything from your team to the environment. In short, it's not a risk you should take. If this is a project you've been assigned that you feel compelled (or obligated) to complete, don't shy away from asking those who complete the procedure on a daily basis for help. Conducting interviews is a normal part of any SOP-creating process. If you're writing or updating an SOP for a group of individuals that are familiar with protocol, terminology, etc., and just would benefit from a short and snappy SOP that's more like a checklist, you could just write it in short-form. Apart from basic purpose and relevant information (date, author, ID#, etc.), it's really just a short list of steps. When no details or clarification are needed, this is the way to go. What's obvious is that you have a procedure within your organization that keeps on getting repeated over and over and over. But is there a specific reason why this SOP is particularly useful? Does it need to stress safety? Compliance measures? Is it used for training or on a day-to-day basis? Here are a few reasons why your SOP is necessary to the success of your team:  To ensure compliance standards are met To maximize production requirements To ensure the procedure has no adverse impact on environment To ensure safety To ensure everything goes according to schedule To prevent failures in manufacturing To be used as training document If you know what your SOP should emphasize, it'll be easier to structure your writing around those points. It's also easier to see just how important your SOP is.",
      "In general, technical SOPs will consist of four elements apart from the procedure itself:   Title page. This includes 1) the title of the procedure, 2) an SOP identification number, 3) date of issue or revision, 4) the name of the agency/division/branch the SOP applies to, and 5) the signatures of those who prepared and approved of the SOP. This can be formatted however you like, as long as the information is clear.  Table of Contents. This is only necessary if your SOP is quite long, allowing for ease of reference. A simple standard outline is what you'd find here.  Quality Assurance/Quality Control. A procedure is not a good procedure if it cannot be checked. Have the necessary materials and details provided so the reader can make sure they've obtained the desired results. This may or may not include other documents, like performance evaluation samples.  Reference. Be sure to list all cited or significant references. If you reference other SOPs, be sure to attach the necessary information in the appendix. Your organization may have different protocol than this. If there are already preexisting SOPs you can refer to, abandon this structure and adhere to what's already in place. Scope and applicability. In other words, describe the purpose of the process, its limits, and how it's used. Include standards, regulatory requirements, roles and responsibilities, and inputs and outputs.  Methodology and procedures. The meat of the issue -- list all the steps with necessary details, including what equipment needed. Cover sequential procedures and decision factors. Address the \"what ifs\" and the possible interferences or safety considerations.  Clarification of terminology. Identify acronyms, abbreviations, and all phrases that aren't in common parlance.  Health and safety warnings. To be listed in its own section and alongside the steps where it is an issue. Do not gloss over this section.  Equipment and supplies. Complete list of what is needed and when, where to find equipment, standards of equipment, etc.  Cautions and interferences. Basically, a troubleshooting section. Cover what could go wrong, what to look out for, and what may interfere with the final, ideal product.  Give each of these topics their own section (usually denoted by numbers or letters) to keep your SOP from being wordy and confusing and to allow for easy reference. This is by no means an exhaustive list; this is just the tip of the procedural iceberg. Your organization may specify other aspects that require attention. Odds are your audience isn't choosing to read this for fun. You want to keep it short and clear -- otherwise their attention will stray or they'll find the document formidable and hard to grasp. In general, keep your sentences as short as possible.   Here's a bad example: Make sure that you clean out all of the dust from the air shafts before you begin using them.  Here's a good example: Vacuum all dust from air shafts before use. In general, don't use \"you.\" It should be implied. Speak in the active voice and start your sentences with command verbs. The last thing you want to do is write an SOP that is just plain inaccurate. You're compromising the safety of your team, their efficacy, their time, and you're taking an established process and not paying it any mind -- something your teammates may find a little offensive. If you need to, ask questions! You want to get this right. Of course, if you don't know, ask multiple sources, covering all roles and responsibilities. One team member may not follow standard operating procedure or another may only be involved in a portion of the deed. If you have a step or two that are particularly intimidating, make it easy on your readers with some sort of chart or diagram. It makes it easier to read and gives the mind a brief hiatus from trying to make sense of it all. And it'll be appear more complete and well-written for you. Don't include these just to bulk up your SOP; only do this if necessary or if trying to bridge a language gap. Your SOP is probably one of many SOPS -- because of this, hopefully your organization has some type of larger database cataloging everything within a certain reference system. Your SOP is part of this reference system, and therefore needs some type of code in order to be found. That's where the notation comes in. Each page should have a short title or ID #, a revision number, date, and \"page # of #\" in the upper right hand corner (for most formats). You may or may not need a footnote (or have these in the footnote), depending on your organization's preferences.",
      "If you don't want to test your procedure, you probably haven't written it well enough. Have someone with a limited knowledge of the process (or a person representative of the normal reader) use your SOP to guide them. What issues did they run across? If any, address them and make the necessary improvements.  It's best to have a handful of people test your SOP. Different individuals will have different issues, allowing for a wide variety of (hopefully useful) responses Be sure to test the procedure on someone who's never done it before. Anyone with prior knowledge will be relying on their knowledge to get them through and not your work, thus defeating the purpose. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what your bosses think of the SOP. It's those who actually do the work that it matters to. So before you submit your work to the higher ups, show your stuff to those that'll be doing (or that do) the job. What do they think? Allowing them to get involved and feel like they're part of the process will make them more likely to accept this SOP you're working on. And they'll inevitably have some great ideas! Once the team gives you the go ahead, send it to your advisors. They'll probably have less input on the actual content itself, but they'll let you know if it meets formatting requirements, if there's anything you missed, and the protocol for making it all official and input into the system.  Route the SOP for approvals using document management systems to ensure audit trails of the approvals. This will vary from organization to organization. Basically, you want everything to meet guidelines and regulations. Signatures will be necessary and most organizations nowadays have no problem accepting electronic signatures. This may involve executing a formal training for the affect personnel (e.g. classroom training, computer-based training, etc.) or it may mean your paper is hung up in the bathroom. Whatever it is, get your work out there! You worked for it. Time for recognition! Be sure your SOP remains current. If it ever gets outdated, update it, get the updates re-approved and documented, and redistribute the SOP as necessary. Your team's safety, productivity, and success matter on it."

      "Accessing and Preparing the Radiator Unit",
      "Keeping Your Baseboard Radiators Running Efficiently",
      "Cleaning Inside the Radiator"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Before you get started, find the main power control or shutoff valve for the baseboard radiator unit and switch it off. You may also want to turn your thermostat down to keep the temperature low just in case. The copper pipes circulating hot water through the radiator can get scalding hot, so don’t put yourself at any unnecessary risk while cleaning them.  Give the radiator several minutes to cool down before you open it up. Don’t attempt to clean the radiator until you’re certain it’s stopped circulating hot water. Move everything out from in front of the radiator. This includes curtains, furniture and anything else that is blocking the unit or may get in your way during the cleaning process. Ideally, the hot air generated by the radiator should have as clear a path to warm the room as possible. It’s a good idea to keep your furniture dusted to prevent your baseboard radiators from getting so dirty in the future. Take the face plate cover off of the radiator unit. This can usually be accomplished by pulling the cover up from the bottom and lifting it off the groove where it rests on top. Set the cover aside until you’re finished cleaning.  Hold your hand a safe distance away from the pipes inside the radiator. This will help you determine whether it’s too hot to work on. One option is to place the radiator cover on the floor under the unit to collect whatever debris is shaken loose while cleaning. Just be sure to clean the cover separately before you put it back on. Look inside the radiator. Along the length of the copper pipe that conducts hot water through your home you’ll find a collection of small, tightly-grouped aluminum squares lined up side-by-side. These are known as “fins,” and they play an important role in diffusing the heat created by the radiator. This is what you’ll be cleaning. Most of the time, dust simply accumulates around the outer surface of the fins, meaning they just need a quick vacuuming.",
      "To ensure that your baseboard radiators are working the way they’re supposed to, you should aim to clean them at least twice a year. Give them a good vacuuming at the start of the heating season (usually around late September or October) and again in early spring before you shut them off for the warmer months, checking them as needed in the meantime. Keeping the unit clear of dust will allow it to heat your home more efficiently.  If you have pets that shed or live in a place with a high amount of dust buildup, you might want to clean your radiator units more frequently. Radiators that are well-maintained aren't forced to use as much energy, which means you’ll save money heating your home. Baseboard radiators work by pulling cold air up from floor level and filtering it through the heated fins, which quickly warm the air and circulate it back through the room. Help the process along by keeping all drapes, furniture and other belongings out of the way of the radiator. The area around the top and bottom of the unit should be kept clear so that air can pass through without difficulty. Be sure to keep the vents at the top of the radiator’s cover open to let warm air escape. Keep your living space free of dust, especially around the baseboards and any furniture that happens to be close to your radiator. Dust from the surrounding environment can get sucked into the radiator as it draws in cool air from the room, and will quickly accumulate around the fins and other sensitive parts of the unit's interior. Frequent dusting is not just a good habit to get into, it can extend the life of your baseboard radiator and cut down on the number of tedious cleanings it requires.  Dust before your clean your radiator so that the loose particles floating around the room don't get pulled into the unit's air ducts. Don't just focus on visible dust. Be sure to vacuum your carpet, drapes and any other surface that might be harboring unseen dust. Over time, the fins along your radiator pipes, or the pipes themselves, may take a beating and need to be changed out. Call your heating and air specialist and ask for an estimate for the installation of new pipes or fins if you notice that yours are bent, ruptured or otherwise damaged. The fins do most of the work of putting off the heat generated by the hot water pipes, so it’s important that they stay in good working order.  Unless you’re experienced in radiator repair, it’s not recommended that you try to replace fin-tubing yourself. The metal fins increase the surface area used to conduct heat from the pipes, warming the room at a much faster rate.",
      "Take a vacuum cleaner or shop vac and slide on a brush-head attachment. This is the most efficient way to clean objects with complex construction and many irregular surfaces, like the inside of a radiator. The brush attachment will dislodge dust and debris on the fins, which can then be sucked up by the vacuum. You may be able to dust your unit without the use of a brush attachment (or with another device like a hand vacuum), but it will take longer and won’t be as thorough. Turn on the vacuum and place your hand over the hose to make sure it’s getting proper suction. Run the brush head along the length of the radiator pipes and fins, using long, sweeping motions to collect as much dust as possible. Go over the fins as many times as you need to until you’re satisfied with their condition.  Brush around the fins in both directions, across the tops and down the sides. If your unit is particularly dirty, wipe away cobwebs, dust bunnies and clumps of hair with a dry cloth or paper towel before vacuuming. In some cases the bristles of the brush attachment may not be long enough to penetrate the spaces between the fins. If this is the case, use a separate tool, such as a slender paint brush or pipe cleaner, to work the stuck-on dust and dirt out of the deeper crevices of the unit’s innards.  Cleaning between the fins can be a tedious process, but it’s worth it to save yourself the expense of a poorly-running radiator. Some people claim to have had success loosening stubborn buildup with a spray bottle of water. This is not recommended, as it may cause rust or damage your unit. Depending on how dirty the radiator cover face plate is, you might decide to clean it as well. Wet a washcloth with warm, soapy water. Scrub the inside of the cover to loosen any caked-on grime. Rinse and rewet the washcloth, then wipe away any remaining debris.  This step will be especially important if you used your radiator cover to catch stray debris. Treat rusted metal covers with a rust-remover solution before replacing them. Lift the cover and position so its back side faces the wall. Set the cover down in the groove at the top of the unit’s base, then lower it over the radiator until it fits back into place. It may click or snap to let you know it’s secure."

      "Standard bleach is harsh on clothes, a milder treatment will still get great results. Bleach is not the best product for household use and is designed more for the commercial sector. Try a milder version such as Borax or Oxygen bleach for home use. Consider the negative effects bleach has on the environment by choosing natural remedies. Opt for “sun-bleaching” or by adding ½ a cup of lemon juice to your whites wash cycle. Although bleach is known for it’s cleaning properties, it might actually be causing stains, rather than helping to clean your clothes. If you have used bleach in your built-in bleach dispenser in your washer, make sure you clean this out before putting your next load on. Put your washer on a quick rinse cycle after doing a load where you have added bleach to ensure it is free from any built-up product.",
      "Avoid starting with something really harsh. Add 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of Borax, which you can find at most supermarkets, to 2 cups of water and add it to your washer cycle. Get a cotton ball and saturate it in clear alcohol, such as vodka or gin. Start to rub the stain gently with the cotton ball. Don’t be alarmed when you start to see the color run. As you continue to swab the area, the color from the garment will start to cover over the bleached area. Rinse the garment thoroughly in water once finished. You can leave your garment to dry in the sun or put it in the dryer. This works great as an immediate spot treatment before your stain spreads. Dip a clean, white cloth, such as a flannel, into Sodium Thiosulfate and blot the stain repeatedly until you see it begin to disappear. Once the garment is saturated, rinse in cold water and repeat the process until you are satisfied with the results. This method, which is similar to using alcohol, but much stronger, aims to restore fabrics damaged by bleach and is known as the \"photographic fixer.\"",
      "Find one that matches your garment exactly, otherwise, it will stand out as much as the stain itself! Cover over the stain with the marker, and set it with an iron, or put it in the dryer for a few minutes to make sure the ink doesn't run.  Always test the marker on a rag or old garment first to ensure you have chosen the appropriate color. This works great for black and dark colors, but not so well for whites and light and bright colors. Sometimes it can be better to work with the stain rather than against it. Begin by washing the garment and placing it outside in direct sunlight. Wait several hours and repeat the process if required.  Ultraviolet rays are bleaching your garment, ensure the garment is placed flat with no wrinkles. You want it to lighten evenly. This method won’t make the stain go away fully, but it will help to lighten it. It is a slightly more drastic measure but can be very effective to change the color of the rest of the garment. Add your garment to a large bucket or basin of water, then add a capful of bleach. Swirl the garment around in the bleach mixture until your desired color is reached, adding more bleach as required. Rinse the garment and then allow it to soak for half an hour in a bucket or basin of cold water and hydrogen peroxide.  Add 50 grams of hydrogen peroxide to every 4-5 liters of water. Treat bleaching the whole garment as a final option once you have tried natural remedies and less invasive chemical options.",
      "If you are able to get the stain out this way, you will be using the mildest approach and be able to completely avoid using any chemical products. In a large bucket or basin, add the garment to ¼ cup of lemon juice and 1 gallon of boiling water, allow the garment to soak for 1-2 hours then ring the garment out as much as you can. Let the garment dry fully in the sun before wearing it again. As vinegar contains acetic acid, it helps to dissolve the bleach and peel away the damaged fabric. Buy white vinegar from your local store and completely saturate the stain in vinegar. Rinse the garment in cold water once done and then repeat if necessary.  Prior to treating the garment with vinegar, rinse the garment in cold water to remove any of the residual bleach. Mixing bleach with vinegar can release toxins. Use limited quantities when using vinegar on cotton garments, as in time, vinegar will ruin cotton fabrics. Rather than trying to remove the stain, another option is to cover the stain. Depending on where the stain is, a cleverly placed patch or your favorite badge could do the trick! You could even do a crochet pattern."

      "A macro lens will allow you to best capture the detail of the eye. Macro lenses vary in focal length from 50 to 200mm. You can still take a good close-up photo of the eye with a regular lens, but you may not be able to get the eye to fill the entire frame or capture all the detail you want. If you don’t have a macro lens and don’t want to spend the money to get one, try using a close-up filter as an alternative. Many cellphones have a macro mode, which will allow you to take a more detailed photograph of the eye than with your camera’s standard settings. A macro lens attachment for your cellphone will produce even more detailed shots.  You can find a macro lens attachment for your cellphone at most major retailers and electronics stores. If you’re planning to buy a macro lens attachment, make sure you choose one that fits your phone model. Extension tubes fit between the rear mount of the lens and the camera body. Using an extension tube will magnify the eye in your shot, allowing you to capture more intricate details.",
      "For a close-up shot, the best depth of field is shallow. Set your camera to camera’s aperture number to between f/5.6 and f/11. The aperture number you choose will depend on what details of the eye you want to highlight in your photograph. Play around with the aperture to see how the aperture setting changes your shots. The eye is constantly moving, which can blur your shot. For a sharper image, set your shutter speed to at 1/100th of a second or faster. Using a tripod will also allow you to set a higher shutter speed. Increasing your ISO value allows you to take photographs in low-light conditions, but will make your photo grainy. If you’re taking your photo in a well-lit area, keep your ISO value as low as possible. Autofocus may not focus on the details you want to focus on, so it is best to just turn it off and focus the shot yourself. To manually focus your lens, turn your focus ring so that everything is out of focus. Then turn it back the other way until the details you want to highlight in your shot are in focus. Avoid using your camera’s flash or shining other bright lights at your subject’s eyes. Bright light can damage their eyes, and can cause your subject to squint, interfering with your photograph. It’s impossible to know what combination of viewpoint, composition, focus, and depth of field will produce the best shot. So try as many combinations as you can. When taking a close-up shot, the small changes you make can give you very different photos.",
      "Having your subject look directly at the camera lens will help you take a detailed photo of their iris and pupil. If you want to capture the eye from a different perspective, have your subject look at a fixed point so you can find the best angle from which to take the shot. Are you drawn to the colors and patterns of the iris, or the reflection of the light on the pupil? Do you want to focus on the wrinkles around the eye, or the curvature of the eyelashes? Your answer to this question will be the main detail you focus on when taking your shot. A catch light is the small white spot you sometimes see in close-up photographs of the eye. You can create a catch light by setting up a stable, continuous source of light. You can use a softbox, an umbrella, a ring light, or natural light to create this effect. Make sure that your camera isn’t casting a shadow over your shot. Many close-up shots of the eye don’t turn out for the simple reason that the photographer didn’t get close enough to the eye. Position your camera’s lens as close your subject as it can be without your shot going blurry. Be careful not to block the light you need for your shot. Adjust your zoom until you find a viewpoint you like. Widening your shot to include other detail can provide some context, but may take away from the detail you’ve chosen to focus on. When taking a close-up shot, the slightest shake of your hand can blur your photo. Using a tripod or other surface to support your camera as you take your photo will help prevent this from happening. If you want to take a macro photograph of your own eye, a camera with flip screen is the best option because it will allow you to easily see whether your shot is on target and in focus. If your camera doesn’t have a flip screen, however, placing a small mirror behind your camera will also give you a view of the display screen. If you’re taking a photo of your own eye with a cellphone, you’ll also want to use a mirror. This is because taking a photo of your eye on the selfie setting of your phone will affect the lighting of your shot."

Start by wetting your jeans. You should wet the area you want to dye, but wetting the entire pair is fine, too. You can wet them anywhere—in the shower, with the hose, or in the sink. Lay a cloth or tarp over your workspace to protect the area from the dye. Wring out any excess water and lay your jeans flat to dry. This will take a few hours. Then, feel free to add finishing touches, like fraying or rips!  Check your dye label for any special drying instructions. Wash and dry you dip dyed jeans by themselves for the first time. After that, feel free to wash them with other clothes.",
      "Before you begin dip dyeing your jeans, you should decide what color you want to dye them.  If you want to dip dye your jeans white, you'll be using bleach only. If you want to dip dye your jeans with color, you'll be using a fabric dye of your choice. You'll also use bleach if you need to lighten your jeans before dyeing. Choose a pair of jeans to dip dye. You can choose jean shorts or long jeans—both will work. Try to choose a simple pair with limited hardware and embroidery.  Pick a pair of jeans that you find boring. Dip dyeing will spice them up! Note that if you want to dye dark jeans with color, you'll have to bleach them first. Dip dyeing is a creative process. Before you begin, you should decide how you want your dip dye design to look.  You might want to dye only the very bottom of your jeans, or you might decide to dye 2/3 of your jeans. It's completely up to you. You might also want to create an ombre look, in which the dye follows a gradient. Dip dye comes in many colors, and you can use more than one on the same pair of jeans.

      "One of the most common and obvious sources of added sugars are in foods like candy, cookies, cakes, pastries, and other dessert-type foods.  Most know that there is a large quantity of added sugars in these foods when they're made.  Giving up on these can help cut out a large portion of added sugar in your diet.  As mentioned before, you can choose to cut out these foods cold turkey or taper them slowly out of your diet. If you're going cold turkey, you may not be interested in healthy swaps.  If you're tapering them out of your diet, you may find it helpful to plan some naturally sweetened, healthy alternatives into your day. Sweet treats provide a lot of enjoyment in our diets.  When you're trying to give up sugar, it'll be helpful to find low-sugar or naturally sweetened alternatives when you're in the mood to indulge.  Use fruit instead.  You can try a small bowl of fruit plain or sprinkled with a little cinnamon after dinner.  If you're allowing yourself a small amount of sugar, you can try serving your fruit with a small amount of low-fat whipped cream or dipping fruit into dark chocolate (which contains small amounts of sugar). If you like baked goods like muffins, pancakes or sweet breads, you can try using sugar-free baking techniques.  Many recipes can be made with unsweetened applesauce, sweet potato puree or pumpkin puree for a naturally sweetened sugar source. If you don't like cooking or preparing foods, you may want to consider buying low sugar treats.  Many foods that are made for diabetics or are diet foods may be helpful.  Do note that these may contain higher amounts of artificial sweeteners. Alcohol also contains sugar.  In addition, it doesn't come with any nutritional benefits.  Eliminate alcohol altogether or stick to \"light\" or low-carb options.  All alcoholic beverages have some sugar.  It's not just the sweetened mixed drinks like margaritas. If you're in the mood for a beer, choose light or low-carb for the least amount of calories and sugar. If you're in the mood for a glass of wine, make it a \"spritzer.\"  This is a mix of wine and seltzer which cuts the sugar and calories in half. If you typically want a mixed drink, ask for unsweetened mixers like seltzer or diet sodas to help cut down on sugar and calories. If you are going to include some sugars, it might be wise to choose more naturally occurring, less processed forms of sugar.  Try honey, agave syrup, molasses, or maple syrup for a touch of added sweetness. All of these sweeteners are natural and may even contain some vitamins and antioxidants.  Make sure that if you choose to use these types of sweeteners that they are not mixtures.  For example, some companies sell honey that's a mixture of honey and corn syrup.  Make sure you purchase 100% honey or 100% maple syrup. It's easy to consume hidden sugar in restaurants, since the meals don't come with nutrition labels for you to examine. You can always ask the server to tell you what's in a dish, but it's often better to have a good strategy for ordering food with the least amount of sugar. Try doing the following to keep your restaurant meals sugar-free:  Get your salads dressed with plain oil and vinegar, rather than choosing a pre-made salad dressing.  Also, always ask for dressings to be served on the side. Ask for main dishes to be made without sauces and gravies that might have added sugar.  Again, ask for these to be served on the side. When in doubt, order steamed vegetables or plain grilled meats instead of casseroles and other mixed dishes that contain a lot of ingredients. Look for the most simple items on the menu.  These will most likely have the least amount of added ingredients. For dessert, opt for a plain bowl of fruit or skip it altogether. Since many people are giving up sugars and have become more health conscious, scientists have developed different artificial sweeteners as low-calorie replacements. Aspartame, saccharin, sugar alcohols, and other sweeteners have a variety of different side effects and could potentially be harmful to your health.  Studies have shown that when you're trying to give up sugar, the sweet taste of artificial sweeteners may make you crave sugar even more.  Avoid processed food that's been sweetened with artificial sweeteners e.g. diet drinks and any typically sweet item that's labeled sugar-free, like candy, ice cream, cake, etc. Artificial sugar might be listed as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, neotame, sucralose, maltitol, sorbitol, or xylitol.  Avoid these if you'd like.",
      "Eliminating sugar requires paying very close attention to what you buy at the grocery store since sugar is added to many types of food.  The nutrition fact panel will let you know how many grams of sugar is in each serving of your food.  However, this doesn't tell you if it's natural or added sugar. Be mindful when you shop!  You most likely expect to find added sugars in something like cookies, but you might be surprised to see it's also commonly added to savory foods like salad dressing, bread, and tomato sauce. Check labels carefully and avoid foods that contain sugar. Read the ingredient list to figure out if there's any added sugar to your foods.  Remember, some food will have sugar listed on the nutrition fact panel, but there is no added sugar to the products.  For example, plain yogurt or unsweetened applesauce both contain naturally occurring sugar. Added sugars include white sugar, brown sugar, beet sugar, cane sugar, molasses, agave syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, turbinado, honey, maple syrup, agave syrup, fruit juice concentrate and many more. Added sugars that are mixed with food to sweeten them and contain no nutritional value on their own. Naturally-occurring sugars in fruit and milk come with vitamins, minerals, and fiber making them much more nutritious.  Naturally-occurring sugars include fructose (found in fruit) and lactose (found in milk).  All fruit, fruit products (like unsweetened applesauce) and dairy products (like yogurt, milk or cottage cheese) contain varying amounts of naturally occurring sugars. You can make a variety of healthier swaps by substituting foods that contain natural sugar for added sugar.  When you're craving something sweet, go for naturally sweet items like fruit or yogurt. Sugar is commonly added to processed and packaged foods to improve the taste, texture, and shelf life.  Frozen food, packaged snacks, canned soup, sauces, salad dressings, and marinades often have added sugar. Try making some of these items from scratch if you can. Go for unsweetened and plain varieties whenever possible.  For example, consume unsweetened applesauce or plain yogurt.  Flavored items generally contain added sugars. Even fruit can be loaded with sugar when it's processed. Fruit juice has been stripped of fiber and water that helps you feel full. If you're including fruit in your diet, go for whole fruit.",
      "When you're deciding to give up any food you'll have to decide if you're going give it up all at once or slowly taper it out of your diet.  Regardless of which option you choose, there will likely be some withdrawal symptoms.  If you consume large quantities of sugar or have been consuming it for a long period of time, going cold turkey might come with more intense withdrawal symptoms.  It might be best to slowly remove sugar from your diet over a few weeks. If you only consume small amounts of sugar you may be able to go cold turkey with minimal symptoms. If you choose to taper down the amount of sugar you're including in your diet, make sure to be honest about your choices.  Don't indulge in a sweet treat just to have a source of sugar in your day. Letting go of sugar may not always be an easy task.  In addition, finding foods to replace sugar in diet may also be difficult or time consuming.  Start journaling your foods, diet plan, and how you're feeling as you cut sugar out of your diet.  Come up with a strategy and make notes in your journal.  You might start by writing down a food diary to get an idea of how much sugar you consume in any given day or week.  Then you can start making a plan of how to reduce sugar in your diet. Also include different healthy swaps you are thinking about using.  You might need to try a few different things before you find something that works. You can also include notes on your mood or how you're feeling about your progress.  Journaling is a great way to manage any stress related to this task. Like many food addictions, when you give-up the offending food, you may have some side effects.  These symptoms are normal and to be expected. Remember that sugar is essentially a drug. With any drug, quitting can lead to withdrawal and cravings. These will pass but the initial withdrawal phase may be a bit tricky.  How long you experience withdrawal symptoms depends on how much sugar you've been eating each day and for how long you've been consuming sugar.  The more sugar you've been consuming and the longer you've been doing it may mean more intense or long-lasting side effects.  In general, for the first week or two after giving up sugar, you might feel nauseous, have a headache, and feel cranky. Your body has come to rely on its daily sugar boost, and taking that away will have an effect until you get used to it. Journal about your symptoms and write down positive thoughts of giving up sugar to get you through the uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms.  It'll be worth the discomfort in the end, when your mood levels out and you feel healthier and more energetic than you did when you were addicted to sugar. You might dream of cupcakes, ice cream, and candy for the first few weeks, but rest assured that your cravings will eventually go away. In the meantime, curb them by trying the following:  Dilute sweet beverages.  Mix regular sodas with water or unsweetened seltzer.  Dilute juices and other sweetened drinks with water as well.  Keep doing so until you feel comfortable switching to only water or other sugar-free beverages. Reach for fruit.  If you're craving a sweet treat, trying reaching for sweet fruit.  Good ideas to try include:  pineapple, mango, and bananas as these are slightly more sweet than other fruits. Stick to low-calorie.  If you're really craving something sweet and fruit or other tricks won't do it, go for a calorie-controlled option.  Sticking to a treat that's less than 150 calories is a smart move.  Try buying small, portioned controlled items to help keep you in control. Giving up sugar isn't easy, and it can help to have support from other people who are going through the same thing. Instead of trying to do it all alone, sign up for a group program or support group.  Groups are either in person or online.   You'll be able to share motivational stories and tips for making the process go more smoothly. It's nice to have people with whom you can share your achievements, too! Tell your friends and family what you're up to. The fact that you're giving up sugar may have an impact on other people you regularly eat with.  Explain to them why you're giving it up, what foods you can no longer eat and what foods you can. Ask them to help you on your journey to giving up sugar, and perhaps even join you. Telling others you have set a goal to give up sugar gives you accountability and support. It also lessens the risk that friends and loved ones will offer you sugar-filled items. Birthday parties, holidays, and other special occasions are celebrated with sugary treats, and it can feel next to impossible not to indulge. If you overindulge, that's OK.  Get right back up and start back on your sugar-free diet as soon as you can.  Try journaling about what you ate and why you ate it.  Many times it might be stress or other emotional factors playing a part into why you slipped up. If you can, limit yourself to just one piece or one cookie so you don't end up throwing yourself off too much. Afterward, get right back on your sugar-free diet. You might experience increased cravings for a few days afterward, so you'll have to be extra careful to keep sugar away."

      "Rogaine has an ingredient called minoxidil that helps to stimulate fresh hair growth. It is one of the most popular hair growth methods for men. You can purchase Rogaine over-the-counter at most drug stores. Just remember, it is formulated for hair growth on top of the head, not the face, and usage is not FDA approved.  It is dangerous to ingest minoxidil, so be careful when applying Rogaine near your mouth. Be sure to consult with your physician before using Rogaine for facial hair growth.  You may experience side effects such as eye burning or irritation, dandruff, or itchy skin. Testosterone, which is the male sex hormone, can be applied through injection, through topical applications, or taken orally (though this is not recommended due to adverse effects on the liver). Low testosterone levels could be responsible for stunted facial hair growth. For best results, testosterone therapy should be closely regulated. Too much testosterone can backfire, and actually inhibit growth of hair.  If you have low testosterone, there will likely be other symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction and decreased muscle mass. Your doctor will want to run some tests to make sure your levels are actually low. Don't count on a prescription based solely on your hair growth. Using testosterone may take up to a year to produce results. For some, nature was just not kind, and no matter what you try, whiskers refuse to call your face \"home.\" When all else fails, a plastic surgeon can help by transplanting hair follicles from your scalp into your face. Hair transplants can be very effective, but they can also be costly, in terms of time and money.  This is generally done on an outpatient basis, and will result in some mild skin irritation. It can also take quite a long time—one to two years—for the procedure to deliver the results you want.  Ask your general physician to recommend someone she trusts to perform the transplants. Make sure you have a consultation beforehand, and ask plenty of questions about the procedure.",
      "Your skin is your body's largest organ, and has many important functions. One of those functions is helping you grow hair. Caring for your skin is one of the most effective ways that you can support the growth of fuller facial hair.  Exfoliate your face. Hair follicles can become blocked with dirt and prevent your hair from growing. Once a week, wear an exfoliant mask with eucalyptus. It's great for your skin, and can help promote hair growth.  Use hair-healthy grooming products. Shampoos, or lotions with a vitamin B complex, will help. Massage your hair follicles. A gentle massage can help stimulate your hair follicles. Use your finger tips, and gently massage your face in circular motions for about two to three minutes. Try applying a facial moisturizer to create a smoother massage. What you eat can have a major impact on all aspects of your physical well-being. This includes healthy skin and healthy hair growth. There are many vitamins that have been found to promote hair growth--including facial hair. Pay attention to your diet, and make sure that you're getting enough of these particular nutrients.  Incorporate hair-healthy vitamins into your diet. While you can always apply hair-growth treatments to your face, and hope for the best, working from the inside out is always the better option.  Take in vitamin A. This vitamin stimulates the production of sebum, which keeps your hair follicles and skin hydrated. You can find vitamin A in eggs, meat, cheese, liver, carrots, pumpkin, broccoli, and dark green leafy vegetables.  Get plenty of vitamin E, which has long been recognized as key for healthy skin, and can increase blood flow, which leads to an optimal environment for hair growth. Foods rich in vitamin E include oils, leafy vegetables, nuts, and beans, and most people get plenty of vitamin E when eating a normal diet.  Boost circulation with vitamin B3. Healthy circulation may have a positive effect on hair growth. Reports find that B3 is even more effective when taken with biotin. Take in vitamin B5. This is also known as pantothenic acid. It not only helps the body use fats and proteins, necessary for healthy hair, it also has been reported to help reduce stress; and stress can definitely inhibit hair growth. Vitamin B5 occurs naturally in brewer's yeast, broccoli, avocado, egg yolks, organ meats, duck, milk, lobster, whole-grain breads, and more. There are many health benefits of exercising such as increased circulation, which promotes hair growth. No matter how you choose to exercise, just try to get your heart rate up for about one hour everyday. Making this part of your routine can help encourage healthy hair growth.  Choose an activity that you like. If you like sports, organize a weekly game of basketball or soccer with your friends. Bonus: involving others will make you more likely to stick to your exercise plans. Change your habits. You can find a lot of ways to get more movement in your day. For example, try taking the stairs at work instead of the elevator. Get plenty of sleep. Your body uses sleep as time to grow and repair. Teenagers need around eight to nine hours of sleep every night, and adults need about seven to eight hours of sleep every night. Be sure to plan your schedule so that you are giving your body enough time to function properly, and grow your hair. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This can be hard on the weekends, when it is tempting to sleep in. But having a regular sleep schedule is great for your overall health. Manage your stress. One of the noted side-effects of stress is hair loss. This means avoiding stressful situations, and finding time throughout the day to relax. There are several techniques you can use to lower your stress. Try talking to a friend or family member if you're feeling stressed--they can often be a comfort.  Focus on your breathing. Taking several deep breaths in and out during a stressful situation is a great way to calm your heart rate and clear your mind. Be patient. Remember that not everyone's facial hair grows at the same rate. Worrying about it isn't going to help, and can in fact make the situation worse. Try to focus on other things throughout the day.",
      "You might be frustrated that you are not able to grow a beard that is as full as you would like it to be. But the real problem might not be lack of growth, but lack of time. Beards can take up to four full weeks (and in some cases, even longer) to fully grow in. Many people give up before that time, and assume that they can't grow a full beard, when in reality, they gave up too soon.  Growing a beard is a project you need to commit to. Don't give up after several days! If after four or five weeks you still don't have results you're looking for, then it is time to try some alternative methods. Do not shave your facial hair at the first sign of itching. It is normal for new hairs to cause your skin to feel itchy, but as they get longer, they will soften, and the itching will stop.  Use an over-the-counter steroid cream like hydro-cortisone. This may help relieve some of the itching.  Waiting for hair to grow can be a frustrating experience, especially when your beard and mustache goes through a scraggly period, that may have people commenting. As your hair begins to grow in, it may seem patchy and incomplete. However, as the hairs become longer, the slower-growing follicles will have time to sprout their own hairs. Gradually, the patchy gaps will eventually be hidden, both by longer hairs and the slower, shorter hairs growing in as well. Let your hair do its thing. This means that you should not try to shape it too early in the growth process. When shaping facial hair, it is a common mistake to take off more than the intended amount. For this reason, it's best to just leave it alone while you are growing it out. Don't worry, there will be plenty of time for you to style it later, after you're happy with the growth.  As your hair grows, comb it in the direction you want it to grow. This will help it turn out looking the way you want. After about four weeks, you might want to have a barber or stylist do some professional shaping. Carefully explain that you are growing out your facial hair, and you just want shape--not a reduction in hair. Beard oil hydrates both your facial hair and the skin underneath, helping to increase its growth. Since it contains moisturizing properties, it also acts as a styling agent. A beard oil is great because even if you have less hair than you would like, what you do have will look great.  Experts recommend applying beard oil right after your morning shower. Your pores will be clean and better able to absorb the product. Just put a small amount of oil into your hand and rub it into your face and beard or mustache. Beard oil makes your facial hair look great, and also helps to keep it looking clean and smelling fresh. There are many different brands available, so try a few to find the one you like best. Try visiting the men's floor at your local department store--they might have some free samples. There are certain nutrients that you can add to your daily routine that can help encourage faster, more effective hair growth. Consider adding supplements to your morning regimen--just ask your doctor before making changes to your health care routine.  Promote thicker hair with folic acid. This is necessary for the growth and repair of hair. Most drug stores and health food stores will sell folic acid supplements.  You can also try increasing the amount of folic acid in your diet. Folic acid can be found in whole-grain breads and cereals, leafy green vegetables, peas, and nuts.  Increase your biotin intake. Biotin is an important water-soluble B vitamin, necessary for the the formation of fatty acids and glucose, as well as for metabolizing amino acids and carbohydrates. A biotin deficiency can lead to hair loss, so making sure you are getting the recommended amount is well worth the effort.  Biotin is found in liver, oysters, cauliflower, beans, fish, carrots, bananas, soy flour, egg yolks, cereals, yeast, and other foods. While you can take vitamin supplements that include biotin, eating fresh foods is a great option, if it is available to you."

Use the applicator that came with your adhesive or a small paint brush.  Make sure the adhesive extends ¼ of an inch beyond the edges of the tear. If you’re fixing a seam on a flocked surface, use more adhesive to ensure that the two sides of the seam stick together. The goal is to make sure that both sides of the opening remain in contact while the adhesives sets up. Consider using clothespins to hold the two sides of the tear together. Just be careful not to glue the clothespins to the mattress. This is called “setting up” and will take a few hours.   Drying times will vary depending on the adhesive but 6-8 hours is a good bet.",

However, the most reliable methods seem to be the easiest: using your ears and spraying the mattress with soapy water. Whichever method you choose, always inspect the mattress systematically.  First inspect the valves. Then, check the seams. Finally, inspect the flat surfaces of mattress. Use a permanent marker or a piece of masking tape.  For “flocked” (fuzzy) mattresses, use fine grit sandpaper or an emery board to smooth the area before attempting to patch it. Be gentle! And make sure to remove any debris with a damp cloth or vacuum cleaner before proceeding.  Alternatively, use acetone—an ingredient found in many nail polish removers—to smooth the flocked area before patching it. Wet a cotton ball with a small amount of acetone and dab the area around the hole. Then, use something rigid like a spoon to scrape away the flocking. Finally, use rubbing alcohol to clean the area thoroughly. Use hair dryer to speed up the process. Or let the mattress air-dry overnight. ",

You can also consider using rubber cement. Duct tape can be used in place of the vinyl if no other alternatives are available.  You may also need something with which to apply the adhesive. A small paint brush is ideal.  Use the applicator that came with the adhesive or small paint brush. Make sure you cover the entire surface of the patch. If the leak is small and in an area where a patch cannot make full contact with the mattress fabric, you can try plugging the leak with a small a bit of adhesive. Press firmly and smooth it out. The goal is get the patch to make full contact with the mattress. Consider weighting down the patch with a 10-pound weight to ensure full contact between the patch and the mattress.

If the valve is leaking air because the valve plug isn’t properly sealing against the valve stem, you can line the stem with a thin piece of plastic to help it seal properly. If the valve is damaged beyond repair, order a new one from the manufacturer and replace it according to the instructions."

      "You’ll be able to study more efficiently if you work in a comfortable space without distractions. Set up a desk or table in a quiet area of your home. A corner of your bedroom might be a good spot. Let other people in your household know that you are studying and don’t want to be disturbed.   Choose an area without a TV. If you like to work with noise, try listening to soft music. You might find that you work well in a corner of the library or in a nearby coffee shop. Bring everything you need with you to your study area so that you don’t have to get back up. This might include books, notes, water, or snacks. If you’re tempted to check your phone frequently, leave it outside of your study space. A quick way to retain information is to write an outline. An outline will help you to segment your studying so that the topics don’t blend together, which could be confusing. Use an outline style that works for you. For example, your outline might include notes on each section of the textbook. Or you might start by listing main points first, and then adding details in later.  You’ll be able to sneak in quick study sessions by just looking at your outline instead of all of the material. For a test on World War II, your outline headings might be:  Origins European Theater Pacific Theater The home front You’ll be able to study much more quickly if you are already familiar with the material. Make sure that you don’t just attend class, but that you are mentally present. Sit up straight and listen to the teacher. Pay attention when other students ask questions or make comments.  Engage with the material by participating in a constructive debate with other students. Take good notes by noting key points and jotting down questions you need to ask. Take 10 minutes every day to look over your notes. This will help you retain the information. When it comes time to study, you’ll really just need to review what you’ve already learned. Make flashcards of key terms if that system works for you. Don’t waste time studying by trying to figure out what the teacher means or what they want. Before you start studying, ask your teacher about anything that is unclear. You could say, “Will the test include Chapter 23?” You could also ask, “Is it more important that we know exact dates or should I focus on the larger themes?”",
      "The first sentence should introduce you to the subject of the paragraph. The last sentence should wrap up the idea and serve as a transition to the next paragraph. By focusing on these parts, you’ll be able to quickly grasp the author’s main point.  After you have determined that the paragraph is necessary to read, go back and scan the body of it. Look for keywords and phrases that relate to the main point. Another option is to go back through all of the paragraphs after you finish reading and read only the first and last sentences of the paragraphs. You can write notes more quickly if you use the margins of your book. Simply draw an arrow to the point you’re commenting on and write brief notes. Of course, you should only do this if the book is yours. Make sure to use a pencil! For example, if you’re studying for a test about World War II, your brief note might read “D-Day, major undertaking, allowed the Allies onto mainland Europe.” When you are reading quickly, skip over the small words like “the”, “and”, and “it”. Your brain will automatically fill these words in as needed. You don’t need to take the extra time to actively read them.  If you’re reading literature, you might miss some of the finer details of the writing when you’re reading quickly. You can still use this approach, and go back and read the book for pleasure later. Many textbooks will include features designed specifically to help you study. Your chapter might include a list of key terms, chronology of the subject, or charts or graphs that clearly present data. Make sure to use these tools to help you quickly grasp the key points. If you are using a textbook, focus on any key terms that are in bold font or underlined. You can also start at the end of the chapter to find any key terms or important concepts listed there before you start reading. Then, skim the chapter for this information. When you slouch, your body has to work harder to breath, taking up extra energy. Use good posture when you read so that all of your energy can go towards reading faster. Don’t ever try to study laying down. It could put you to sleep!",
      "Your brain needs exercise just like your body. To keep it in good shape, and to keep that memory sharp, you should regularly engage in challenging mental activities. You can learn something new or sharpen an existing skill. If you play music, try tackling a difficult new piece. Or, you could try doing a tricky crossword puzzle. Exercise that involves cardio activity is especially good for strengthening your memory. Incorporate aerobic exercise into your daily routine. Try taking a break during lunch or between classes to take a brisk walk. Activities that require hand eye coordination are also effective. Try taking a tennis lesson to build this skill. If you miss out on sleep, your memory and critical thinking skills can suffer. Aim to get 7.5 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Try to get into a routine of going to be and getting up at the same time each day. Turn off the TV and electronic devices 1 hour before bedtime. Unwind with a book or a cup of tea. Good news! You can actually keep your brain healthy by hanging out with your friends. It will keep you from being stressed, which can hamper your concentration. Make time to hang out with your friends regularly. Try going to a funny movie or checking out a concert together. Try to get your other senses involved in learning. For example, you can try reading notes or your book out loud to help retain information. If you’re more visual, draw an image or chart that will help you visualize what you’re studying. You can also practice explaining your information. Imagine that you have to teach someone else the material that you are studying. Figuring out how to do this can help you more quickly absorb information."

      "Dig under the foxtail and turn the plants under the soil, packing them down into the dark, hot conditions. Doing so can impede growth and help kill off this pesky grass. Work by moonlight, at dawn, or at dusk. There is some speculation that turning the soil exposes the foxtail to a bright flash of light, thereby stimulating the plant and making it grow faster. If you turn the soil at night instead of during daylight hours, though, you can reduce this effect by as much as 78 percent. Alternatively, you could dig out the weeds one by one and dispose of them elsewhere, away from the contaminated area. Make sure that you remove the entire plant, including the roots, and not just the top portion.  Remove the seed heads first to prevent them from spreading and repopulating the area with additional foxtail. After removing the seed heads, dig beneath the plants using a long, slender weeding tool to get at the long roots. Note that weeds are easier to pull when the soil is wet and the weeds are young. Foxtail is no exception to the rule. Pull the foxtail from its base if working by hand. Wear thick gardening gloves to protect your hands as you work. You could try using a mower or weed-wacker to cut off the tops and flowering heads of the foxtail. You will need to continually re-trim the foxtail throughout the season, though, since the plant will send up another flowering head as the summer progresses. If you do opt for the mower or weed-wacker option, make sure that you clean the blades afterward to prevent the accidental spread of foxtail seed. You should also rake the lawn to remove all the heads. Taking these additional steps will improve your chances of removing the foxtail with only a surface mowing. If you like the ease and effectiveness of herbicides but do not like to use harsh chemicals on your vegetation, you can use vinegar instead. Vinegar is a natural and fairly tame acid, but it has been known to be effective in the removal of weed-type grasses like foxtail.  A typical USDA-approved vinegar is five-percent acetic acid. Pour the vinegar directly onto the foxtail at the ground level. The basic idea is to get it as close to the roots as possible. Use enough vinegar to soak the soil beneath the foxtail. It does not need to be soggy, but it should be damp to the touch. Wait a week or two after the first application and monitor the effects. Dead or dying foxtail should be pulled as soon as possible. Foxtail that is still growing even after you use the vinegar should be soaked with another round. Reapply the vinegar as needed. Note that vinegar tends to be more effective when used on fox tail at the seedling state. It might not help quite as much on mature plants. While the concept of pouring urine onto a lawn or other area of vegetation may make you cringe, it can be just as effective as vinegar when used as an herbicide. Urine is a strong, organic alkaline substance, so it can kill foxtail in the same way that a chemical herbicide might.  You can purchase \"predator urine\" products at garden stores. These products are usually used as deterrents or repellents against small garden pests, but they can also be used for herbicidal purposes. A cheaper and even more effective solution would be to use human urine. Collect the urine in a bucket and pour it straight onto the base of the foxtail, aiming for direct contact with the roots. As with many other control methods, you might need to use multiple applications of urine or use this organic herbicide in conjunction with physical removal methods. Remove the clumps of foxtail by hand or with a garden hoe once you notice them dying off. If the foxtail is still fairly young, kill the new growth as soon as possible by covering it with some form of mulch. Mulch can prevent sunlight and air from reaching the foxtail, essentially depriving it of the nutrients and light necessary for growth.  The foxtail will need to be trimmed close to the ground before you can apply mulch and use it as a way to get rid of the weed. If you have other plants and vegetation that you are trying to preserve, spread the mulch in between the plants and along the rows. Make sure that it covers the foxtail. Organic mulches like wheat straw, shredded leaves, and wood chips work well. Spread about 2 inches (5 cm) of mulch. You could also layer damp black-ink-only newsprint beneath the mulch to improve its ability to inhibit growth.",
      "Broadleaf fertilizers will not work against foxtail since foxtail is a grass. If you want to use chemical control methods, you should look for an herbicide that can kill grasses. One of the most easily accessible types is a chemical called glyphosate. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide, so it will kill just about everything in the area you apply it in. For best results, spray the entire area with the glyphosate. Even though the other vegetation there will likely die, this is the quickest and most effective way of getting rid of fox tail. You will probably need to apply the herbicide two to three times, at minimum, before it wipes out the foxtail completely. Wait until after the foxtail reemerges before using another application. You should wait until two weeks or so pass before re-applying the herbicide, especially if using a potent one like glyphosate. While chemical herbicides can take care of the majority of the problem, enlisting the help of certain organic control methods can help in between applications, making the extermination process go quicker overall. Seven to ten days after you apply the herbicide, turn under the dead plant residue. If you plan to amend the soil, do so now.",
      "If you are fine with chemical treatments, then a pre-emergent herbicide should be applied to the area just before new growth would be expected to form. This is especially important if you have had problems with foxtail already.  A few standard chemical options include dacthal, balan, and pendimethalin.  For an organic pre-emergent herbicide, try corn gluten meal. Sprinkle the product after your new lawn begins to grow to prevent foxtail and other weeds from taking root. Do not use it before growing your new lawn, though, since it could also prevent the desired grass from growing. Apply a pre-emergent herbicide treatment in the spring. If you apply it too early, though, they can lose their effectiveness. For best results, apply the herbicide once the weather warms up and stays warm. Lay it down just before you would expect the fox tail to pop up. The soil conditions need to be ideal for other plants. If other plants can thrive in the soil, they will grow and absorb more nutrients, making it harder for the foxtail to find enough nutrients to survive.  The exact pH your soil should be will vary depending on the type of vegetation you have there. The fertilizer and other soil amendments you use on the area will affect the pH. Note that such amendments generally have a greater impact on the pH if they are worked into the soil instead of spread on top. Herbicides can affect the pH, as well. As a general rule, if you add an acidic herbicide, balance it out with an alkaline substance afterward, and vice versa. Have a sample of your soil analyzed for pH at a lab. When an area of land is crowded by too much vegetation, some of the vegetation will inevitably die off once the roots begin to compete for nutrients and resources.  You could also replace the grass entirely with sod. When choosing vegetation to plant in the area, opt for a solid-stand crop like legumes or grass hay. Row crops, like soybeans and corn, offer too much space in the soil and are not effective at stopping foxtail growth. If you plant other forms of grass in the area, keep the grass as plush, thick, and healthy as possible. Thick grass can also be helpful for use against foxtail growth. Regular mowing can keep the yard healthy, and a healthy yard is less likely to foster the growth of weeds like foxtail. While keeping the area trimmed is important, you should not keep it bare, either. Maintain a minimum grass height between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm)."

      "Using Adhesive Hooks"
    ],

      "Start at the inner edge of the window frame and measure to the opposite inner edge to get the window's width. You'll use the width to purchase to the right size tension rod for your curtains. Tension rods have a spring mechanism inside of them that creates tension when the ends of the rod are pressed against a window frame. If the rod is too short, there won't be enough tension, and if the rod is too long, there will be too much tension. Tension rods generally list a window size range on the packaging, so look for one that will work based on the width of your window.  You can find tension rods online or at your local hardware store. If you have particularly heavy curtains, you may want to try adhesive strips instead of a tension rod. A tension rod is best for small, lightweight curtains. The right way to adjust the length of your tension rod will depend on the model you're using, but generally, you'll pull or twist on the rod. You want the tension rod to be slightly longer than the width of your window so there's enough tension to hold it in place. If you're not sure how to adjust the length of your tension rod, refer to the instructions that came with it. Use a pencil to draw a circle around each end of the tension rod where it pushes into the frame. Use a level to make sure the rod is even before you make your marks. Slide the hoops or fasteners on your curtains onto the rod. Make sure all of the panels you want to use are on and facing the right direction since you'll need to take the tension rod down if you want to adjust them. If your curtains have clips instead of hoops, you don't need to take the tension rod down to hang them up. Insert the tension rod into the frame so the ends are aligned with the marks you made earlier. If the rod doesn't feel secure, you may need to take it down and adjust it so it's longer and there's more tension.",
      "Adhesive hooks come in different weight capacities, and you'll want to make sure the hooks you get are strong enough to hold up your curtains and curtain rod so they don't fall. Generally, adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) should work.  You'll need 2 adhesive hooks per pair of curtains you want to hang up. You can find adhesive hooks online or at your local hardware store. Since you'll be using 2 adhesive hooks, each hook only needs to hold half of the weight of your curtains. For example, if your curtains and curtain rod weigh 32 pounds (15 kg) in total, you would need 2 adhesive hooks that can hold up to 16 pounds (7.3 kg) each. Many adhesive hook brands have stylized versions, made with steel or wood rather than plastic. Opt for these varieties if the aesthetic of your curtains is important to you. Draw a square at least 2 in (5.1 cm) wide in the corner of the piece of cardboard. Then, cut it out with scissors to create a right angle. You'll use the piece of cardboard with the right angle in the corner to mark where you want to hang up your adhesive hooks so they're level with each other. The corner of the window should be aligned with the right angle you cut out of the cardboard. Hold one of the adhesive hooks over the cardboard where you want to hang it, and mark the bottom of it on the cardboard with a pencil. Keep the cardboard aligned with the corner of the window while you puncture it with the pencil. You want the mark on the wall to be directly behind the mark on the cardboard. Try twisting and pressing on the pencil simultaneously to puncture the cardboard. Align the right angle on the cardboard with the other side of the window, and use the pencil to make a mark through the hole you punctured in it. Now you should have a mark on each side of the window to show you where to hang your adhesive hooks. The marks should be level. Take the adhesive strip off of the back of your hooks and press them firmly on the wall so the marks you made are lined up with the bottoms of the hooks. Make sure you press on the hooks for 30 seconds so the adhesive sticks. The adhesive on the hooks needs time to dry before it's secure. If you try to hang your curtains on the hooks too soon, they might fall down. The exact amount of time you should wait may vary depending on the kind of adhesive hooks you're using. Refer to the packaging for specific instructions. Your curtain rod should balance perfectly on the hooks. If it slides or tilts in one direction, the hooks might not be level. Try removing one of the hooks and checking to see that the marks are level. Run the curtain rod through the hoops at the top of your curtains and then hang it up again. Draw the curtains and let them sit for 1 hour to make sure the adhesive hooks can hold the weight. If your curtain falls, either the adhesive didn't fully stick to the wall or your curtain may be too heavy for the hooks. Consider buying higher-weight capacity hooks, or use 2 adjacent hooks on each side to balance the weight a little better."

      "Enjoying Cherries on Their Own",
      "Using Cherries in Recipes"
    ],
    "document": [
      "While most people think of cherries as a single type of small red fruit, there are many varieties of cherry, each with their own shape, size and use. Doing a little research (as well as knowing what you want cherries for) is a smart first move. Here are a few of the most popular types of cherry you should know about:  Bing cherries are arguably the best-known, archetypal cherry. They are red, and very versatile, great both for using in recipes and eating on their own. Rainier cherries are large cherries with a yellow hue to them. When they're most ripe, they develop a more reddish colour. Lapin cherries tend to be dark red and quite big. They're perfect for making jams with. Although there are canned and packaged options, you'll want to get cherries fresh whenever possible. Hand-picking them is the best option, as it gives you the most control over which ones to buy. Go to a local and trusted produce store, and buy a bagful. As a rule, if you're getting the popular red Bing cherries, you should look for the darkest cherries of the lot. Darker cherries are riper, and have a sweeter kick to them. Lighter cherries are generally more sour, and better suited for baking rather than eating them by themselves. Giving your cherries a good wash at home will remove any remaining pesticides, making them safer to eat. This rule applies to all uncanned produce, so make sure to give it all a rinse before you move forward! Putting them under the faucet for around 30 seconds should suffice. Try to avoid washing your cherries prior to storing. Adding moisture will dry them out and hurt their taste, so it's better to wash them right before eating. The most complex and unique aspect of eating cherries is the pitting process. While removing the pit from a cherry isn't necessary, leaving them in means you'll have to spit the pit out afterward, as eating them is mildly toxic. Its easy to eat around the pits of fruit like peaches, but a cherry is so small that it should be removed manually. There are several ways to do this, and it's recommended you try out most of them to see which one suits you best.   The best option if you're going to be eating a lot of cherries is a specialized cherry pitter. These simple contraptions are usually reasonably priced, and can make the pitting process several times faster than they would be if you're doing them by hand. If you're not interested in picking up a pitter, you can get a steady momentum going by using a chopstick and a glass bottle. Place the cherry on top of the bottle with the stem on top, and push the chopstick through the cherry. The pit should fall through into the bottle, eliminating any cleanup from other methods. If you're looking for an easy, basic solution to pitting, take a knife and cut around the edge of the stem. Once you've cut around, you can pull the pit out. This process takes significantly longer than the other methods listed, but it'll do in a pinch if you don't have a lot of utensils around. If you're wanting to circumvent the pitting process altogether, you can always purchase a pack of pitted cherries. Keep in mind, however, that these tend to be less fresh than if you were hand-picking them yourself. Arguably the most overlooked part of the way someone eats is where they're eating. Trying to eat somewhere busy and crowded isn't going to lend itself to a memorable snacking experience. Find something where you don't have to worry about anything distracting you from your cherries. You might find it beneficial to add an element of ritual to your cherry-eating. Even if it's just finding a favourite chair to sit in each time you eat them, treating the experience with an air of importance might enrich your experience. It goes without saying that the most important part of enjoying cherries is eating them! The key here is to draw out the experience of eating it; let the cherry sit on your tongue, and let yourself focus on the taste as you bit down into it. Close your eyes, and let your taste buds appreciate each cherry for all they're worth! Savouring food is a lost art in the current age of expedience and efficiency. If you're having a hard time pacing yourself while you eat, try to give yourself approximately 45 seconds for each cherry. It's important to note that cherries are very perishable. In a refrigerator, they might last a week if you're lucky! If you want to save yourself the trouble of constantly going back to the grocery store, you can freeze them in bulk. Bring them out and let them thaw a few hours before you plan on eating them.  Frozen cherries are best eaten within a year, although judging from how delicious they are, it's not likely you'll have them sitting around a fraction of that time!",
      "If you're new to using cherries in your cooking, it's definitely recommended to look online for some standard options. Most often, cherries are used in dessert dishes for their sweet taste. For certain recipes (particularly baking) you'll want lighter-tinted, sour cherries. If you're adding them as an accent, as you would atop a sundae, you'll want them dark and sweet. You don't have to make up your mind right away, but it's a good idea to have some vague idea what you'd like to make with your cherries. This includes washing and pitting them. Remembering to do this is arguably even more important when you're using them in a recipe; if you cherries in a pie, for example, without first pitting them, the entire pie will end up being ruined! The most famous use of cherries in cooking is arguably in pies. Cherry pie is a staple dish in many cafes, and for good reason! You can add cherries into your pie whole if you want, or you can mash them into a thick paste so they're able to disperse more evenly. You can even try baking with cherry jam! There are lots of possibilities when it comes to baking; look up some solid recipes, and you'll end up with a delicious summertime treat. An even simpler way of adding cherries is through salads. Salads tend to be inclusive of all sorts of fruits and vegetables. You won't need too many cherries to accent your salad-- just a few will give a tangy kick to your meal you won't soon forget. In many ways, an ice cream sundae is the ultimate dessert. It can be made even better by adding a cherry atop some whipped cream. While it will taste great, adding cherries as accents has the extra benefit of boasting some visual panache as well. It's an easy way to give your home concoctions the look of fine dining. For sundaes, you'll want to get sweeter, darker cherries. The sour taste of light cherries doesn't compliment ice cream nearly as well. Jam is one of the most versatile creations you can make from fruit. The sweetness in cherries makes them perfect for making jams with. Pit your cherries, pick off the stems, and finely chop them up. Next, add some sugar and pectin, and mix them together until they make an even paste. Next, boil it together. Look up some special recipes, and you'll have your own homemade jam in no time at all.  Cherry jam is best served on bread, but it's also great in pies and on ice cream."

      "Recognizing the Symptoms of Postpartum Psychosis"
    ],
    "document": [
      "If you think you may have postpartum psychosis, see your doctor or go to an emergency room or urgent care center right away. If someone close to you is showing signs of postpartum psychosis, do everything in your power to get that person treatment – she may be too disoriented or unstable to recognize that she needs help on her own. The doctor should ask for a complete medical history and a detailed description of any symptoms. Provide as much information as you can, and be honest – do not attempt to conceal the severity of your symptoms or act like you are okay when you are not. Note that if the person getting evaluated for postpartum psychosis is not you but rather your wife, partner, or friend, you may need to provide some or all of this information yourself. She may not be in a position to speak rationally or to give a detailed account of her symptoms. Some of the symptoms of postpartum psychosis can occasionally be caused by underlying medical conditions: a serious infection, a very high fever, or a neurological problem, for example. A doctor should evaluate symptoms and perform tests, usually including basic blood work, to rule out potential medical issues. Many women develop postpartum depression after the birth of a baby, and their symptoms can be very debilitating. Some of these symptoms – especially mood swings, extreme sadness, and sleep disturbances – are also indicative of postpartum psychosis. A good doctor will distinguish between these conditions by looking for evidence of psychotic episodes: hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, mania, and the like. Knowing exactly what’s going on is the first step to treating the condition and recovering completely. If the doctor rules out underlying medical causes and notes a psychotic component to the mental disturbance, he or she may diagnose you (or your wife or partner) with postpartum psychosis.",
      "A woman with postpartum psychosis may insist that she needs to be at home, caring for her baby, but this condition requires that you follow medical advice. Doing otherwise poses a threat to both mother and baby. Many women with postpartum psychosis need to be hospitalized so that medical staff can monitor them until they stabilize. Entering a hospital – especially a psychiatric hospital, as frequently necessary – can be upsetting, especially for new mothers, who may insist that they need to be at home. But this step is often necessary for effective treatment. If your wife, partner, or loved one must be hospitalized with postpartum psychosis, try to assure her that hospitalization is temporary and that full-time, effective treatment will help her get home to her baby as quickly as possible. Do everything in your power to convince her that she is doing the right thing for herself and for her newborn. Women with postpartum psychosis are typically prescribed some combination of antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers. When taken as directed, these drugs are generally quite effective. These drugs may or may not be safe to take when breastfeeding, so talk to your doctor and weigh the risks and benefits of particular medications. Remember that treating the postpartum psychosis should be the primary concern, followed by continuation of breastfeeding. Some women benefit from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This is a modern form of shock therapy that is sometimes effective in treating psychotic episodes. Postpartum psychosis is a medical condition, and it demands medical treatment. In addition, though, talk therapy may be beneficial, especially the disorder begins to recede. A counselor can help you (or your wife, partner, or loved one) deal with the symptoms of postpartum psychosis and the trauma that the condition can inflict. Moving forward, a counselor can also help you deal with any feelings of doubt or guilt about motherhood, which many women experience after postpartum depression, anxiety, or psychosis. Note that if you are not sure you absolutely need counseling or cannot afford, talking it out with your significant other or family member is amazing therapy in its own. Spending an hour or two on its own can make a difference and can relieve you of some symptoms.",
      "Women who develop postpartum psychosis often see or hear things that are not really there. These hallucinations may be frightening, upsetting, or disorienting. They may come and go, or they may persist. Hallucinations are one of the major signs that distinguishes postpartum psychosis from postpartum depression, and it requires immediate medical intervention. Confusion also distinguishes postpartum psychosis from postpartum depression. Even healthy new mothers may seem exhausted and mentally foggy, but these symptoms should not evolve into true confusion or bewilderment. A woman with postpartum psychosis may seem puzzled by what’s going on around her unable to understand what others are saying to her. Along with hallucinations and confusion, delusions – strange but strongly held beliefs that a rational person would know to be false – are one of the chief symptoms that distinguishes postpartum psychosis from postpartum depression. Delusions also require immediate medical treatment. They may not cause a woman to hurt herself or someone else, but in some cases, they do lead to violence. These delusions, perhaps in combination with hallucinations, may make a woman paranoid or suspicious. Someone with postpartum psychosis may think her friends and family members are lying to her or trying to hurt her; she may feel that she is being watched or followed. Mood swings are a common symptom for women with postpartum depression and anxiety, and they also play a role in postpartum psychosis. Women who develop postpartum psychosis tend to move quickly from one emotional state to another; they may suddenly find themselves overwhelmingly sad, distressed, irritated, or angry, and they may or may not be able to pinpoint any reason for the abrupt shift in mood. Difficulty sleeping is also characteristic of all the postpartum psychiatric conditions, but it may be especially pronounced in women with postpartum psychosis. They may develop persistent insomnia, or they may feel that they do not need to sleep at all. This symptom can be especially difficult to detect because most new mothers, even perfectly healthy ones, struggle with sleep. Newborns do not sleep reliably, and they must eat frequently, which can disrupt their mothers’ sleeping patterns. For women with postpartum psychosis, though, difficulties with sleep persist even when they are given the opportunity to rest (as when a spouse, partner, friend, or relative agrees to care for the baby temporarily). Postpartum psychosis can make a woman seem manic, agitated, or unusually energetic. She may not be able to sit still or calm down. Women with postpartum psychosis sometimes articulate the sense that they are “going crazy” or “losing their minds.” Do not dismiss these feelings; get help. Technically, postpartum psychosis can develop at up to six months postpartum, but almost all cases occur during the first four weeks. If you are a new mother yourself, or if your wife or partner recently gave birth, pay particular attention to mental and psychological symptoms during this early period. Women with a history of bipolar disorder have a much higher incidence of postpartum psychosis, as do women who have had postpartum psychosis before. Family history may also play a role: if a new mother has a family history of mental illness, her risk of developing postpartum psychosis increases. Be particularly vigilant in these cases. Note, however, that half of all women who develop postpartum psychosis have none of these risk factors. The disorder sometimes occurs for no discernible reason at all."

      "In addition to past relationships and childhood experiences, negative thinking may be preventing you from loving or being loved. Some people think negative thoughts about themselves or their partners that cause the relationship to suffer. Do not allow a negative thought to go through your mind without addressing and reframing it. Doing so will help you to change your mindset and stop reinforcing your fears about loving or being loved. The next time you have a negative thought, turn it into a positive one.  For example, if you are worried about being rejected, you might think something like, “She’s way out of my league. She’s going to dump me.” Or, if you feel unworthy of being loved you might think something like, “You are too ugly for anyone to ever love you, so don’t even try.” These thoughts are damaging to your self-esteem and to your ability to love and be loved. If you are dealing with these types of negative thoughts, you will need to work to silence them and change them. The next time that you find yourself thinking a negative thought, stop yourself and change the thought. If you think to yourself, “She’s way out of my league. She’s going to dump me,” turn it into something more positive. Change it to something like, “She’s a beautiful woman. I am excited to see where this relationship goes.” You might also benefit from some positive self-talk regarding love. Try using positive daily affirmations to develop more positive feelings about love. Positive daily affirmations can help you to deal with the negative emotions that may be part of your fears about love. Take a few moments each day to look at yourself in the mirror and say something positive about love. You can say something that you believe about love or something that you would like to believe about love. Some examples of things you might tell yourself include:  “I am worthy of love.” “I will have a fulfilling loving relationship someday.” “Love is a wonderful thing.” Vulnerability is defined as the risk and uncertainty that comes along with emotional exposure. People who fear loving and being loved often have their defenses up in a relationship. If you want to overcome your fear of loving and being loved, you will need to lower your defenses and allow yourself to be vulnerable to your partner. This might sound frightening, but it is an important step to become more comfortable with love. Common defenses against feeling vulnerable include retreating into a fantasy world or presenting yourself in a less than ideal way.  Identify the defenses that you use to prevent yourself from feeling vulnerable. What are your defenses? How can you lower them and begin to allow yourself to be more vulnerable? In your next relationship, try taking the long view — using memories of past happiness as insurance for the future or recalling the original commitment and promises made each other. Talking to someone about your fears and feelings may help you to deal with your fears about loving and being loved. If you are in a relationship consider sharing these feelings with your partner. Telling your partner how you feel can open up the possibilities for greater intimacy in your relationship. Make sure that you have this discussion with your partner when you are both calm, not after or during an argument.  If you are not in a relationship or if you are not ready to talk to your partner about your feelings, talk to a trusted friend instead. Try starting by saying something like, “I think my past/current relationship problems were caused by some of my fears about love. I am trying to work through those feelings so that the problems do not continue. Would you be willing to discuss that with me?” Sometimes fears related to loving and being love are so severe that you need to get help from a counselor. If your problems continue despite your attempts to make thing better, consider talking to a counselor about these issues. A counselor can help you to get to the root of the problems and deal with them so that you can have healthier relationships in the future.",
      "The first step in dealing with your issues with loving and/or being loved is to identify the fear that is holding you back. There are many different types of fear that can cause a person to fear loving someone or being loved.  Consider your feelings and try to figure out what your main concern is. What are you afraid might happen if you allow yourself to love or be loved? Try writing about your feelings to explore them in more depth. Writing about your fears concerning love may help you to identify the root of your fears and the act of writing may help you to work through some of your feelings as well. One way that you can start to understand your fear regarding loving or being loved is to think back on your past relationships. Consider the problems that arose in the relationship and how you contributed to those problems. What did you struggle with in the relationship? What did you fight about? If you broke up, what was the reason for the breakup? In what ways did you contribute to problems in the relationship? What thoughts caused you to respond in the ways that you did? Sometimes childhood experiences can contribute to our ability to love and be loved. If you had some difficult experiences as a child, you may be carrying to feelings into your adult relationships. Consider things that happened to you or around you as a child and how they might be affecting you as an adult. Was there a lot of fighting in your household when you were a child? Did you feel rejected or unloved by one or more of your parents? How did these experiences make you feel? Many people have fears when it comes to loving and being loved. Among those fears are the fear of getting hurt, fear of hurting someone, and fear of commitment. Consider these different types of fears and try to determine if your feelings align with any of these categories.   Fear of Getting Hurt  If you have been hurt in previous relationships, you know how painful it is and may want to protect yourself from ever feeling that way again. As a result, you might try to prevent yourself from falling in love in order to avoid having to feel those painful emotions again.  Fear of Hurting Someone  Perhaps you have hurt people in previous relationships and it made you feel guilty. As a result, you might want to avoid getting into another relationship and causing the same pain to someone else who you care about.  Fear of Commitment  Maybe the idea of being committed to one person for the rest of your life is terrifying to you, so you don’t allow yourself to get too attached.  Fear of Loss of Identity  Some people think falling in love means that they have to give up certain parts of their identity, which can be scary and may cause some people may avoid love. Some people struggle to love and be loved because they believe that they are not loveable or not worthy of being loved. This belief can be the result of childhood neglect, rejection, or other experiences that caused you to feel unworthy of being loved. Consider whether or not your feel like you are worth of being loved. Some people fear love because it makes them think about their mortality. Loving someone and being loved back can make the thought of death much scarier because you have more to lose. Some people may even avoid falling in love or being loved because of these negative, frightening feelings."

      "In many states, you may be able to apply for registration through the DMV website. This can save you a lengthy visit to the DMV office. In other states, you may be able to begin the process online, but then take care of the rest with a briefer DMV visit.  For example, in New York you can use the “E-Z Visit” service. This service will let you begin your application online. As a result, this will reduce the time you need to spend at the registry office.  As another example, Pennsylvania will let you renew your registration online, as long as you meet certain qualifications.  You will want to check your own state’s site to learn your options. Find out where the nearest DMV office to your home is located. Most states’ websites provide a list of locations. You will want to find the one that is closest or most convenient to you. Some states also allow you to make appointments online. This would reduce your waiting time when you go to register your vehicle.  For example, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has an interactive map of the state that illustrates the DMV office locations. When you select the one nearest you, a pop-up box provides you with the address, telephone number and hours of operation for that office. You can also click on a link for directions.  Take your completed forms and payment for all required fees to the office. In most states, the registration fee is based on the value of the vehicle that you are registering. You may not be able to plan for the exact amount of the registration fee. Call the office to find out what options you may have for payment. Most DMV offices will accept cash, checks, money orders or credit cards. You should find out which forms are accepted in your new state and try to estimate the amount you will need to pay. For example, the Nevada DMV provides a link on its website for a fee estimate. If you provide your vehicle’s VIN, make, model and year, the link can give you an estimate of the registration fee. Be aware that even this link is only an estimate, and the final fee will not be set until you visit the DMV office.",
      "Each state sets its own limits for vehicle registration. After a few years, you will need to reapply or at least renew your registration. The renewal process is usually easier and quicker than the initial registration. Many states will allow you to renew your registration on line every year or every 2 years.  In Nevada, for example, you can renew your registration online from any computer.  You can also quickly renew your registration online in Massachusetts. Some states will give you a temporary registration and mail your plates in 2 to 4 weeks. Other states will have them ready for you immediately. Be sure that you do not leave the DMV office without understanding their process for this. Some states will charge you a fee if you do not return your license plates.  New York, for example, requires that you return your old plates when you register the vehicle in a new state. You would need to print and complete the Plate Surrender Application, and then return that completed form with your old plates.  Call the DMV or MVA in your old state and find out where to send them. Your old state's agency might also have this information on their website.",
      "Some states may call the regulating agency the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Motor Vehicle Bureau, or some other similar name. Do a quick Internet search for the name of your state and “car registration,” and you should find the information you need to get to their website.  For example, if you live in California, you will find the website for the California Department of Motor Vehicles at www.dmv.ca.gov.  If you have just moved to New Hampshire, the agency is the Division of Motor Vehicles.  In Massachusetts, for example, the office is the Registry of Motor Vehicles. When you move into a new state, you generally must register your car in the new state within a certain time frame. This may be as short as 30 days or less.  For example, the website for the Washington State Department of Licensing says that you must register your car in the state within 30 days of moving. In many states, you must get a new driver’s license within your new home state either as part of registering the car or before you can register the car. Each state will have different requirements for registering your vehicle. When you find the website for your new DMV, you should be able to find a list of requirements for registration. Some of the most common requirements include the following:  Your identification. You will need to demonstrate some government-issued identification that shows that you match the owner of the vehicle. This may be your driver’s license, passport, or some other state-issued identification card.  Proof of ownership. You will most definitely need to provide some proof that you are the owner of the vehicle. This is most likely going to be the Title Certificate, although you may be able to present your registration from your previous state. If you still owe money on a loan, the lender probably is holding the certificate of title. You will at least want to check with the DMV on how to proceed in this case. You can probably get a certificate or statement from the lien holder to verify title ownership.  Odometer disclosure statement. In some states, you merely need to provide the odometer reading on your own. In other states, you may need to take your vehicle to a state-approved location and have an odometer reading certified.  Emissions disclosure statement. Several states, most notably California, require that your car must pass an emissions test before you can register it. Even if you passed such a test in your prior state, you must get a new certification if you move into California.  Bill of sale. Particularly if you have purchased your car recently, you may need to show some extra proof of purchase. Contact either the DMV or your own insurance company to find out what form of proof is required for a vehicle registration. Your insurance company may have a simple form or certificate that they can send you. You may need to have a particular DMV form stamped by your insurance company. Plan ahead, because getting this paperwork may take a few days. In some states, you may need a cursory safety inspection, while other states will require a multi-stage inspection that includes both vehicle operation and emissions or smog certification. Find out your state’s requirements and leave yourself enough time to get it done. When your car passes each stage of the inspection, you should get a certificate of some sort. Make sure that you have this available for the registration.",
      "If you can access the form online, download and print it at home. If this is not a possibility, you would then need to visit the DMV office to get a registration application form. In either case, make sure that you get the correct form. The form that you need to register a vehicle that is coming in from another state might be different than the form for registering a newly purchased vehicle. If you have questions, call the DMV to ask. For example, if you are registering a vehicle in California, you will need their Form REG 343, which is titled, “Application for Title or Registration.” Read over the form carefully before you begin, to make sure that you complete the portions that apply to you. In some states, a single form will be used for multiple purposes. For example, if you are moving into New York and wish to register your vehicle, the form you use is titled, “Vehicle Registration/Title Application.” The same form is used to register your vehicle, renew or change a registration, replace a lost or damaged registration, title certificate or license plates, get a title, or transfer your license plates. Be sure that you mark the correct boxes. If you are completing the form online, you may be able to type your information directly onto the form and then print the completed, typed form. Otherwise, you should print the form and complete it neatly in ink. If you leave out any information, or if your writing is illegible, your application may be denied, delayed, or incorrect. You will need to provide the year, make and model of the car. You will also need to provide the vehicle’s complete Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Be careful to provide this accurately. If you make mistakes on the application form, your final registration may include errors. These can be difficult to correct later. You can usually find the VIN on a small plate just under the windshield on the driver’s side of the dashboard. Be sure to copy all numbers and letters of the VIN carefully."

      "Give yourself plenty of time to commute to the office and get to meetings or other appointments. Be early to give yourself time to prepare or just catch up on emails or other tasks. Try tracking the time it takes you to get to work every day to see what the true average is, and adjust your timing accordingly. Add a buffer time of 15 or 20 minutes to any given time, and even test out how long it takes to get somewhere in advance of going there for the first time. Get plenty of rest so that your mind stays sharp and thinking efficiently. Have a cup of coffee or tea in the morning if you like, or whenever you need a boost. Take breaks and pause to reorganize your desk periodically. Get up from your desk or take a break from what you’re doing for 17 minutes after every 52 minutes, as studies show this makes for the best productivity. Do a few simple exercises, talk to coworkers, or just take a stroll around the office during this time. Familiarize yourself with the schedule for your boss, yourself, or any other employees you need to keep track of at the beginning of every day. Glance over the schedule periodically so you can save time when making appointments and avoid double-booking or other errors. Keep schedules and calendars open and available to pull up on your computer or phone at a moment’s notice so you can consult them and add appointments in right away. Show up to any appointment ready with materials and clear notes from previous meetings, and a device or notebook to take down minutes and other notes from the current meeting. Ask your boss about anything regarding your role in the meeting, including any special materials like forms or handouts that you can have ready to save time on preparing or printing later. Try sending out an agenda for the upcoming meeting, minutes from the last meeting, or any other relevant materials to all the attendees the morning of or night before. Learn about different types of shorthand and ways to speed up your writing if you take a lot of notes by hand. Take a shorthand course to learn the characters and improve your speed. If you don’t often take notes by hand or you don’t want to learn shorthand, do a typing test. Set a timer for a minute and try typing out a typical email on your phone, tablet, laptop keyboard, and detached keyboard. Then count the number of words you typed on each device. Stick to the device with the highest word count when you need to take quick notes.",
      "Keep a planner, calendar, and to-do list and update them consistently. Keep them in easily seen and reached places, or have multiple that can be synced together.  If you work well with pen and paper, keep a small planner or calendar that can fit in your pocket or purse so you always have it with you. Keep a pen attached if possible so you never have to fish around for one. Have a designated note pad for to-do lists at your desk, and cross things off as you go. If you work better with digital organization, use your phone’s calendar and reminder system to make appointments and receive notifications about them. Try apps like Wunderlist or Todoist to manage your tasks. Make sure you always have notes and other materials with you by syncing calendars, lists, and files across all your devices, which nearly every modern app has the capability to do.  Share tasks, documents, and notes with other secretaries, your boss, or other employees with project management software like Basecamp or Trello.  Share documents and spreadsheets with Google Docs and use programs like Dropbox or Hightail to send files. Set up a color-coding system to help categorize all of your materials at a glance. Assign a color to each project, day, employee, or any way you want to delineate your work. Use highlighters and colored tabs or labels to mark up files, trays, and notebooks to easily locate the right information. Many web and mobile apps for email, calendars, and lists also allow you to assign a color to each item. Keep your email inbox clean and important information easy to access by filing an email into a folder right away, flagging or marking it as unread if you need to come back to it, or archiving or deleting it if you’re sure you no longer need it. Try making folders for each year, quarter, or month, or label them by project, employee, or type. Try to respond to, delete, or log the email's information elsewhere right away. Set schedules for yourself, like having all emails filed in appropriate folders by the end of the day, and cleaning out and dealing with everything left in your inbox by the end of the week. Keep materials of the same type in a particular place, and designate notebooks and folders to specific projects. Have a specific notepad for phone memos, for example, that always stays by the phone so you never end up taking down someone’s name and number on a napkin. Keep meeting notes in a separate place from other notes so information doesn’t get mixed up and hard to find later. Avoid printing to save paper and opt for online forms or other documents so you can save time and resources. Fill out forms electronically if possible. Scan and save copies of paper files so they’re always available and don’t get damaged or lost. Circulate digital files, reminders, memos, and agendas instead of paper versions whenever possible. Never run out of important materials you use to be organized, like notepads, pens, envelopes, and stamps by buying or letting an office manager/purchaser know when you are on your last box or container of something rather than once they are all gone. Order supplies in bulk from a company like Quill to save money and avoid running out so quickly. Keep supplies organized at your desk or workspace. Use containers, trays, file folders, and other containers that are all labeled or colored for easy sorting.",
      "Save time and energy by coming up with simple language to reuse for correspondence that you frequently repeat. Have several scripts available for different situations like emails, press releases, or phone calls, which you can copy, paste, and easily edit to suit the specific scenario. Jot down notes on your phone, laptop, or notepad for every meeting, phone message, or other important conversation. Place or move these notes into specifically labeled physical or electronic folders so that you can refer to them later and have records of verbal communication that you may forget in the course of a busy day. Practice your greeting and other important or common information you need to say over the phone. Have the list of phone extensions for your office right in front of you and work on committing them to memory so you can transfer calls quickly. Get to know the special features of your office phone, like sending someone straight to an employee’s voicemail or adding people into a conference call, so you can save time and avoid technical difficulties. Make sure that every form of written communication you send out is spell-checked and free of grammar and punctuation errors. Spend the extra few minutes to read over emails, agendas, and other correspondence to check that everything is correct and save the later time and embarrassment of having to issue corrections or answer emails from confused recipients. Turn on spell-check in the applications you use for documents, spreadsheets, and emails. Turn on this feature in your browser as well to catch any errors while typing on a webpage, especially when posting to the company’s website, social media accounts, or other official platforms. State your purpose for calling or emailing in as few words as possible. Ask direct questions and repeat your name, company, phone number, and email when needed. Provide a time by which you expect or hope to hear back from them so you can deal with communication efficiently. Make sure you’re on the same page and provide reminders by calling or emailing the day before or day-of to confirm appointments and other important engagements. Get back in touch with people you haven’t heard from by sending polite and succinct emails or phone messages to remind them you’re waiting on a response."

      "Before you plant clover, you will need to get rid of any unwanted plant growth. You may use a weed killer, to eliminate any existing turf, weeds, or other unwanted plants.Some types of weed treatments, such as systemic herbicides or chemical broadleaf treatments, may require you to wait up to two weeks before planting new ground cover. Follow all label directions carefully. If animals may feed on your clover, if you may allow the clover to flower for bees to pollinate, and if the area drains into existing groundwater, avoid using chemical compounds such as Roundup. Clover seeds will do best if they don't have to compete with weeds while they're getting established. To remove all vegetation, rocks, and debris from the area, till or rake the soil to a depth of about eight inches (20 cm).  Tilling a month in advance will give any weeds time to regrow so you can remove them before planting. Tilling now will also make it easier to change the soil if the pH needs to be adjusted. To encourage latent weeds and vegetation to grow, provide the tilled area with a light misting of water every day. This process will help you eliminate weeds in a couple weeks, right before planting the clover seeds. You don't have to worry about watering if you're getting sufficient rain during this time. A couple days before planting, use a spade or small shovel to dig up any weeds that have sprouted up since you tilled the land. This will kill competition and give the clover the best possible chance of thriving. You can also use a scythe to cut them out.",
      "Clover seeds are very small and lightweight. To ensure they spread evenly, it's best to mix them with another medium that will make them easier to distribute on the ground. You will need about 2 oz. (57 grams) of seed to cover 1000 square feet (93 sq. m.) of lawn. Before planting, mix your seeds with one of the following:  Soil (preferably unfertilized, to discourage the growth of weeds) Sand Sawdust Use your hand to spread the seed evenly over the lawn. If you have a large lawn, you can use a broadcast spreader, which you can buy at local garden stores and home improvement stores. You can also spread seed over large areas by smoothing the seed and sand mixture over the ground with a leaf rake turned so that the tines face up. Clover seeds will not grow if they are buried in the ground, but covering them with a thin layer of soil will help to keep them in place and prevent wind or predators from disturbing them. Go over the area you've seeded with a rake that is turned so that the tines face up, and gently mix the seeds into the top layer of soil. Do not rake more than a quarter-inch (6 mm) deep, otherwise the seeds won't grow. Water the seeds immediately after spreading them. This process will help the seeds stick in the ground and encourage germination. Provide the seeds with a light misting of water every day that it doesn't rain until the seedlings grow leaves.  During the spring, summer, and warmer fall months, make sure the clover gets about 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm) of water per week. When planted during the warmer spring or summer months, clover seeds will germinate in one to two weeks. Make sure that the seeds do not have a chance to dry out during the day, or the sprouts will not survive. Once your clover lawn is established, take soil samples at least every 2-3 years. Check your soil nutrient and mineral levels, and make adjustments as needed. Try taking samples in spring one year, and in fall the next year. This will help give you an idea of which nutrients are most needed during different parts of the growing cycle.",
      "You can purchase clover seeds at garden stores, at most home and hardware stores, and online. You'll need roughly 2 ounces (57 g) of clover seeds per 1,000 square feet (93 square meters) of lawn.  The most popular types of clovers for lawns are Dutch White (a perennial that grows to 8 inches, or 20 centimeters) and Microclover (a durable clover that has small leaves and short stems).  Inoculated clover seeds of any variety are also popular, because it means you don't have to inoculate them yourself. Inoculation is the process of coating the seeds with a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that allows the clover to produce its own nitrogen. Be sure to store these seeds in a cool, dark place. The best time to plant clover is in spring or summer. To plant in spring, make sure the last frost has occurred, and that nighttime temperatures are staying above 40° F (4° C). The best time to seed clover is between mid-March and mid-August.  In warmer areas, you can plant clover in September and October, but plant it at least six weeks before the first frost. In the warmest areas where winters are mild and there's rarely snow or freezing temperatures in winter, you can plant clover all year round. Depending on the size of your lawn, you may have conditions that vary greatly from one area to another, so some areas may not be ideal for clover. Clover is very hardy and will even grow in partial shade, but it will do best when it gets between four and six hours of sunlight per day. Where possible, prune and trim trees, hedges, and brush to ensure the clover gets enough light."

      "A doctor will administer a Complete Blood Count (CBC), which will show the health of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In order to be considered normal, platelets should be between 150,000-450,000 per microliter of blood. Symptoms of a low platelet count include excessive or easy bruising, and superficial bleeding that appears as a rash on the skin. Additional warning signs include:  Bleeding that will not stop after 5 minutes of pressure Nose, rectum or gum bleeding Blood in your urine or bowel movements Unusually heavy menstrual flow Feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness Fatigue Jaundice Because many causes of low platelet count are caused by diseases or medical conditions, your doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment route for you to treat the condition. This is more effective than merely treating the symptoms. For example, if your low platelet count is a reaction to a medication, your doctor may prescribe a different medication to see if this helps bring up your platelet count. Your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which help slow your body's destruction of platelets. This is usually the first-choice treatment drug.  Your immune system may also be overfunctioning, and could be suppressing your platelets. In this case, your doctor may prescribe immunosuppressants.  Eltrombopag and romiplostim are medications that can help your body produce platelets.  Your doctor may also prescribe oprelvekin (brand name Neumega) or another medicine that has been approved to stimulate the production of stem cells (and thereby platelets). Many cancer patients take this drug as a preventative measure because it is easier to prevent low platelets than build them back up. There's a risk of side effects with this medication, so your doctor will determine whether to prescribe it based on her assessment of your risk of developing a low platelet count. The doctor will also consider whether you have any heart issues, because Neumega's side effects include fluid retention and heart palpitations, which can exacerbate heart conditions. Additional side effects can include diarrhea and other digestive issues.",
      "Alcohol can damage bone marrow and impair platelet function. It also slows your body's production of new platelets. Heavy drinkers are particularly likely to experience a temporary drop in platelet count. Low platelet count can be caused by exposure to toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, arsenic, or benzene, all of which slow platelet production. If your job requires you to work with chemicals such as these, take the necessary safety precautions. Some medications can cause a low platelet count. Even NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as aspirin, naproxen (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can have an effect on your platelet count. NSAIDs may also thin your blood too much, which is a bigger problem if you are also having platelet issues. Do not stop taking any medication you have been prescribed without talking to your doctor first.  Blood thinners such as heparin are the most common causes of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. This type occurs when the medication causes your body to produce too many antibodies, which destroy your platelets.  Chemotherapy drugs and anti-seizure medications such as valproic acid may cause drug-induced non-immune thrombocytopenia. This type occurs when your medication keeps your bone marrow from producing enough platelets.  Other medications that may interfere with platelet production include: furosemide, gold, penicillin, quinidine and quinine, ranitidine, sulfonamides, linezolid, and other antibiotics. Several viral diseases, such as mumps, measles, rubella, and chickenpox, can affect your platelet count. Getting vaccinated for these diseases can help preserve your health and avoid a low platelet count. You should also talk with your pediatrician about vaccinating your child. Most children are healthy enough for vaccination.",
      "Before you make any significant changes to your diet, even if you think your changes will be healthy, you should consult with your physician or a registered dietitian.  Many health conditions and prescription medications must be taken into account when planning a diet plan, so consulting with a professional will keep you safe and healthy. A registered dietitian is an expert who has completed education, training, and supervision in the field of nutrition. Dietitians can help you determine a healthy diet and fitness plan that will account for any health conditions you have and medications or supplements you take. Implementing changes to what you're eating on a daily basis in a gradual fashion will help your body adjust appropriately. Sometimes altering your diet can cause unpleasant symptoms as your body adjusts to the new foods and eliminates the remnants of the old foods. Making gradual changes will also ease any cravings you may feel for what you used to eat, such as sugary treats or salty snacks. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin; folic acid and food folate are both sources of folate. Folate deficiency can cause your bone marrow to have difficulty making enough platelets.  The recommended daily intake of folate varies, but adults should usually have between 400mcg and 600mcg a day. A full list of recommended daily allowances by age can be found at the National Institutes of Health website here.  Beef liver, leafy and dark green vegetables, legumes, fortified cereals, and nuts are good sources of folate. If you don't consume enough vitamin B12, your bone marrow may have difficulty making enough platelets. Vitamin B12 is also essential to red blood cell formation.  The recommended daily intake of B12 varies, but adults should usually have between 2.4mcg and 2.8mcg daily. A full list of recommended daily allowances by age can be found at the National Institutes of Health website here. B12 is commonly found in animal products, so vegetarians and vegans may need a supplement. Good dietary sources of B12 include shellfish, beef liver, fish, fortified cereals, and dairy products. Foods containing probiotics, such as yogurt and fermented foods, may help improve the immune system. Probiotic bacteria may also help regulate the immune system, which may help people with autoimmune disorders (a common cause of low platelet count). Good sources of probiotics include yogurt with live cultures, kefir (fermented milk), kimchi (Korean fermented vegetables), and fermented soy products such as tempeh, miso, and natto. Eat a wide variety of foods, particularly different fruits and vegetables. Eating widely will help your body get all of the nutrients it needs. In addition, try to eat locally; buy produce when it's in season in your local area. Not only will you be getting the freshest produce, but there's also less chance it has any additives or pesticides in order to keep it fresh for transport across long distances.  Visit the grocery store often to shop for fresh produce because the nutrient content decreases with time. Instead of doing all of your shopping on one day, plan to go to the store a few times per week. Always choose fresh varieties over frozen and canned foods. For example, if you have the choice between fresh corn on the cob and canned corn, go for the fresh. Replace these foods with whole, unprocessed food. For example, eat whole grain cereals, brown rice, and whole wheat products. Again, read the labels of products as you shop. Reduce the amount of white flour, white rice and processed foods you consume because  these have been and \"refined\", or stripped of their nutrient-rich coating. Be sure as well to reduce the amount of white sugar you consume, as well as other sweeteners, such as fructose, corn syrup and honey. Cut back as well on fruits with lots of sugar, including mangoes, cherries, and grapes, as well as sugary fruit juices. Sugar can contribute to promoting high levels of acidity in the body."

      "using a postal scale. Electronic postal or pocket scales can be purchased from office suppliers and big-box stores. Set it to measure grams, place your wood onto it, and take note of your wood's weight. If you'd like to keep your scale clean, place a container onto the scale, hit \"Tare,\" and then place the wood in. Use a scale that has an accuracy within 0.1% for the best results. Otherwise, accuracy should be at least within 0.035 ounces (0.99 g). For pin-type moisture meters, press the 2 tips into the wood and activate it for the moisture reading. For pinless meters, press the base of its scanning plate against the wood and turn the meter on. Record the moisture content, which will be a percentage between 0 and 100. Purchase moisture meters from home hardware stores and online suppliers. Place 3 to 5 paper towels onto the microwave oven's plate and place your wood on top. Most ovens come with a \"Low\" setting and a \"Defrost\" setting that is slightly higher. Set it to \"Low\" and look out for smoke—this is a sign that you have burnt away some of the wood weight and volume and any moisture measurements will be inaccurate. Never let wood pieces touch if you're heating multiple samples or they can light on fire. For most microwaves, the next heat level above \"Low\" is \"Defrost.\" Layer 5 paper towels onto the microwave oven's plate, place your wood on top, and set your microwave to \"Defrost.\" If you don't mind waiting, you can set it to the lowest setting, and wait about 4 minutes instead. If you smell smoke or burning on \"Defrost,\" switch to the \"Low\" heat setting. Following the first round of heating, weigh your samples on the scale and record the weights. When drying wood, you will notice each piece loses weight, which is a sign that moisture is leaving. The goal is to continue heating your wood pieces until there is no weight change and each of their moisture contents is stable. Remember that different types of wood dry at different rates. Don't be surprised if some pieces lose moisture slower or faster than others. Heat the wood in intervals of 45 to 60 seconds with a 1-minute rest in between each. For highly accurate scales, you shouldn't be able to detect variation more than 0.1 gram once the drying process is done. For gram scales, stop when you get about 5 or 6 readings that are the same.  Moisture meters can also detect moisture content, but the weight method is the most accurate. Calculate the moisture content following the final heating by using the following formula: (Wet Weight – Oven Dry Weight / Over Dry Weight) x 100.",
      "as fast as possible. If you have just cut down a tree, make the wood into lumber as soon as you can. Processing opens up the wood and helps the drying process, which can prevent stain and rot from affecting the wood. Try and find an indoor location like a hayloft or shed or an outdoor location that is in the shade. Avoid locations like garages which likely don't have enough airflow. Never store wood in the basement or inside boxes as they dry, they definitely won't have enough airflow.  Remember that your wood needs to dry in an area with a similar moisture content that the finished product will be exposed to. For example, if you plan to use the wood to make a chair that will be placed in a dry area of your home, store it in an area with similarly low moisture content Point an electric household fan toward your wood between your cutting sessions to improve airflow. This circulation will help your wood dry in at least half the time that it normally would. Exposed ends can lead to drying that is too fast, which paves the way for end-grain cracking and splits. And since moisture escapes wood 10 to 12 times quicker from the ends, leaving them exposed is damaging to the wood. Apply paraffin wax, shellac, polyurethane, or latex paint to the ends in a uniform manner so that both are completely covered. Try to do so as soon as possible—within minutes—for the best results. Purchase specially formulated end grain sealers from woodworking or home hardware stores if you don't mind paying a bit more money. When you're cutting your lumber, cut the pieces to the same lengths and thicknesses. Afterward, these equal dimensions will make it easier to stack them in a manner that exposes each side to air. Use small pieces of 3⁄4 by 11⁄2 inch (1.9 cm × 14.0 cm) wood, also known as stickers, to create space between each side and increase ventilation. Use spacers every 12 inches (30 cm) for thinner pieces and 16 inch (41 cm) or 24 inch (61 cm) spacing for thicker pieces. Don't cover the entire pile of wood to the ground—this will hold in moisture. By just covering the top, you can ensure that each piece is adequately shaded without trapping moisture. Skip this step if you're storing your wood indoors or somewhere with adequate shade. If you're using a pin-type moisture meter, press the 2 tips of the device into your wood. Afterward, turn it on and examine the moisture reading. For pinless meters, press the base of the scanning plane to the wood and activate it. Moisture readings are a percentage between 0 and 100. Buy both types of moisture meters from online suppliers and home hardware stores.",
      "After setting the heat, place one kitchen rack on the bottom and another in the center. Now, place a large baking pan on the bottom rack and put an oven thermometer onto the center rack in one of its far corners. If your oven doesn’t let you set the temperature to 217 °F (103 °C), set it to the closest increment, such as 215 °F (102 °C). Monitor your oven thermometer every 10 minutes. If it's too high, lower the temperature, and if it's too low, increase it. Always adjust the temperature by the smallest increments for optimal accuracy. Turn on your kitchen fan if it has one—this will ensure optimal airflow. Be sure that none of the pieces are touching. For smaller pieces, lay them perpendicular to each rung of the oven rack to prevent them from falling through. Continue monitoring the oven thermometer every 10 to 15 minutes and adjust temperature accordingly. After 1 hour has passed, remove 2 to 3 wood pieces of varying sizes from the oven. Measure their moisture content using a moisture meter. Continue heating the pieces for 15-minute intervals until the desired MC or until the moisture levels do not decrease anymore. Purchase moisture meters from home hardware stores and online suppliers."

      "Start with your primary care doctor who can initiate an evaluation with blood work, imaging, and a trial of some medications and refer you to the right specialist. Let your physician know if you have a history of addiction, as you may be at higher risk for addiction to painkillers. If your pain is due to the aftereffects of cancer treatments, talk to your oncologist. Pain specialists and oncologists have the most experience dealing with the many complex issues surrounding the treatment of pain. The first step in the medical management of pain is to determine the cause of the pain. The pain may be from disorders such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, cancer, and more.  It might take additional studies, evaluation, and time to find the source.  Once the underlying cause is determined, then treatment can be discussed. You may need to see a number of different doctors, including a rheumatologist, orthopedic, neurologist, and/or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist. After you determine the cause of your pain, you and your doctor can discuss the use of medication. In general, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (Aleve, Advil, aspirin) are used first. The idea is to start first with medications with the fewest side effects. For all these pain medications, it is very important to follow the instructions exactly as written. If the instructions are not clear, make sure you ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them until you are very clear on when and how to take the medication. Report any side effects or problems with the medications right away.  Under some circumstances, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline may be used to control pain. A third class of drugs that may be used are the Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine (Cymbalta). Corticosteroids are primarily used for inflammatory rheumatology and autoimmune disorders. Sometimes a short course is ordered to treat acute pain as well. Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica) have been shown to be useful for some types of nerve pain, including fibromyalgia and neuropathies. Opiates are generally reserved for pain that doesn’t respond to other pain medications. They should be used only for a short period of time and/or after you and your doctor develop a careful treatment plan, as opiates are highly addictive. It is very important to be aware of and stick to the dosage recommended by your physician to minimize the chances of developing a problematic tolerance to the pain medication. Tolerance is defined as “a phenomenon or adaptation of the body over a period of time in which one or more effects of a drug become less with repeated use at the same dose.”  This is often referred to as becoming “immune” to the action of the drug. It is important to understand that tolerance is not an addiction. Tolerance is the body’s adaptation to the drug. The problem with tolerance is that more and more drugs are needed to achieve the same effect, and increasing doses also means there is an increased risk of dangerous or unacceptable side effects and the chance of an accidental overdose. Following the dosage schedule can slow down the tolerance process. More and more pain management programs are interdisciplinary and utilize many different professionals with a wide diversity of skill sets that can help you deal with chronic pain in the healthiest way possible, improving your quality of life as much as possible.  This team first includes you. The pain management team can also include a physician and nurses, in addition to physical, massage, occupational, recreational, and psychological therapists. There may also be social workers, nutritionists and other support staff. The important thing for you to remember is to access the team and make use of the services they have to offer you. You should consider including a physical therapist as part of your pain management team. A physical therapist can help you manage pain by giving you bodily treatments catered towards relieving your pain. These exercises include strengthening exercises, flexibility exercises, manual therapy, posture help, and body mechanics instruction.",
      "Try to stay as active and as socially engaged as you can. When you are dealing with chronic pain, sometimes having people around you can be the very last thing you want; however, having people around can also distract you from the pain and allow you a few moments, or maybe more, to forget the pain. Humans are social creatures and while you may not always want to have people around, and don’t need to 24/7, it has been shown that social contact can have significant effects on pain perception. Socializing can help alleviate loneliness and depression, which can negatively affect chronic pain. As social creatures, finding others who truly understand what you are dealing with can be a significant comfort. Support groups also help you not to feel so alone. The people in the group may be able to offer advice and coping techniques. To find a support group for people dealing with chronic pain, start by looking at the groups at the American Chronic Pain Association or the National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association. . Exercise has been shown to increase the production of endorphins, which naturally reduce pain. Exercise also strengthens muscles along with reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Try low-impact activities, such as yoga, Tai Chi, walking, swimming, cycling, or strength-training.  You will need to talk to your physical therapist and other members of your pain management team to determine whether stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, aerobics, or weight training is best for you. Make sure to find the right level of activity for you. If you do too much, you may have increased pain the next day; however, staying inactive for too long can lead to further problems with pain and mobility. Find the right exercise and amount of activity for your condition. Staying busy and engaging your mind and body in activities that distract you from the pain can be an effective management strategy. Try reading or listening to music. These activities may not be able to let you forget the pain, but it can help you take control of your life. Consider finding a hobby that lets you get out of the house and connect with other people.",
      "Deep breathing is one relaxation technique that can help reduce stress. Learning to relax may help decrease pain.  Lie flat on your back. Use pillows under your knees and neck to make sure you are comfortable. Put your hands palm-down on your stomach, right below the rib cage.  Place the fingers of your hands together so you can feel them separately and know you are doing the exercise correctly. Take a long, slow, deep breath through your nose by expanding your belly. This ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly. Exhale through your mouth. Do this as often as you can.  Use a variation of a Chinese Qigong breathing exercise. Sit down comfortably. The lungs' natural rhythm will take over immediately. Take three short inhalations through the nose. On the first intake, lift your arms, reaching in front, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the second intake, move your arms to the side, keeping the arms at shoulder levels. On the third intake, lift your arms over your head. Repeat 10 to 12 times. If either exercise causes any dizziness, stop. Do these exercises as often as you need. Another way to decrease stress and cope with pain is through progressive muscle relaxation. Start with your toes. Tighten them by curling them under your feet. Hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the toes.  Move on to the feet next. Tighten all the muscles in your feet and hold for five to 10 seconds. Then slowly relax the feet. Move up through your legs, thighs, abdomen, arms, neck, and face, tightening the muscles in each area. Relax slowly every time. Positive visualization can be a form of meditation. Positive visualization and meditation can help relieve stress, which can help ease discomfort and lessen pain.  Pick a favorite spot and get comfortable. Remember a favorite place. Close your eyes and picture that place. Keep the image in your mind. Breathe deeply as you keep the picture in your mind. Don’t worry if you lose the image. Just take a breath and start again. Until you have some practice, you may need to start again a few times. Try and make sure you do this during a time that you are least likely to get interrupted. Look into doing guided imagery through YouTube videos or apps. Using positive affirmations may be effective in helping change your mentality about the pain and lift your mood. Publically say positive things about yourself and your pain. Positive self-talk can help boost your mental perception of the pain. Some people write down their positive affirmations on sticky notes and post these notes everywhere they can. Use the present tense and repeat as often as you can. Examples of positive affirmations are:  Yes, I can. I can get through the pain.  I am getting better. I feel better every day. I can control my pain.",
      "Chiropractors work with the alignment of your musculoskeletal structure to encourage healing and pain relief. Chiropractic care generally is an alternative treatment for pain in your muscles, joints, bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Chiropractic care is used most often for back, leg and neck pain. Another common alternative therapy for chronic pain management is acupuncture. Acupuncture can be very beneficial for arthritic pain, migraines and other forms of chronic pain.  Before getting acupuncture, take the time to learn about acupuncture, where to find a reputable, experienced practitioner, and think about whether it is a treatment for you.  Talk to your pain management team to get recommendations for either an acupuncturist or a chiropractor. Getting a massage will not only help relieve tension, but it may also help relieve stress. These two things can lead to increased pain. Massages are good for all pain, especially back and neck.  Find a massage therapist who specializes in chronic pain. For patients with fibromyalgia, normal massage can be very painful so make sure to let the therapist know and to ask for light, gentle techniques. Research is showing that inflammation may play a part in chronic diseases. Though research is ongoing, it may be that diet can help — by avoiding certain foods, and including those with anti-inflammatory properties, you may be able to reduce your pain.  An anti-inflammatory diet is similar to the Mediterranean Diet. Emphasize lots of fruits and vegetables, snack on nuts, eat fish packed with omega 3's, and healthy fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated). Include these anti-inflammatory spices in your cooking: turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, garlic, cayenne, black pepper, and clove.  Foods to avoid or minimize include sugar, saturated fats, trans fats, excessive omega 6 fatty acids, gluten, casein, refined carbohydrates, mono-sodium glutamate (MSG), aspartame, and alcohol. If medical marijuana is available to you, that is an approach that has proven very effective for many people. Studies are indicating that medical marijuana is a safe and effective approach to pain relief. Discuss this option with your pain management team and find out if it is legal where you live."

      "Pain is one of the most common symptoms of kidney stones, so you may notice it before anything else. Pain from a kidney stone is usually very sharp and severe and can even be incapacitating. You might feel pain in different places and at different times. If you have kidney stones, then you may feel pain that:  Is near your groin and lower abdomen Is located on the side of your back around your ribs Comes and goes, but will worsen over time Becomes more intense and then less intense Happens when you try to urinate Changes in your urine may also signal that you have kidney stones. To determine if you have kidney stones, watch for urine that is:  Brown, red, or pink in color Cloudy Bad smelling Changes in how often you need to urinate can also signal that you may have kidney stones. You may have kidney stones if you:  Feel like you need to urinate even if you just went Find yourself going to the bathroom more often that is normal for you Sometimes kidney stones may cause you to feel nauseous or even to vomit. If you have been nauseous and/or vomiting, then this may also indicate that you have kidney stones. If you notice any severe symptoms, then you should go to an emergency room as soon as possible to get treatment. Severe symptoms to watch for include:  Severe pain that makes it impossible to get comfortable Pain that is accompanied by nausea and vomiting or fever and chills Bloody urine Having a hard time urinating at all",
      "Kidney stones can become more severe and painful if left untreated. If you think that you may have kidney stones, then you should see a doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor can diagnose your kidney stones based on your symptoms, a blood or urine test, or by using imaging such as a CT scan. Getting a CT scan is the most accurate way to determine if you have kidney stones. Your doctor can also use the results of the kidney stones to determine where the stones are at and how big they are. If you are diagnosed with kidney stones, then your doctor will recommend the best course of treatment for your situation. This may include drinking plenty of water in order to help pass the kidney stones or administering special medications to help you pass the stones.  If you kidney stones are large, then your doctor may need to use something called “extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy” or ESWL. This procedure breaks large stones into smaller ones so that you can pass them more easily.  Your doctor can also use a scope to break up a stone that is trapped in your ureter and make it easier for your body to pass.  Be aware that surgery may be required for severe cases of kidney stones that do not respond to other forms of treatment. If your pain is severe, then your doctor may prescribe a prescription pain-killer. But in less severe cases of kidney stones, an over-the-counter pain killer will help to numb the pain.  You may take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin depending on your medical needs and personal preferences. Ask your doctor for a recommendation if you are not sure what to take. Read and follow the product instructions for any medicine that you take.",
      "The strongest risk factor is a history of kidney stones. If you have already had a kidney stone, you have a greater risk of developing more. It is important that you take measures to reduce any other other risk factors. If someone in your family has had kidney stones, then you may be at higher risk of having kidney stones as well. Consider your family member's experiences with kidney stones as you think about whether or not you may have them. Not drinking enough water is another risk factor in developing kidney stones. Water helps to dissolve minerals that may form kidney stones in your body. The more water you drink, the less likely it is that these minerals will cling to each other and form stones. Eating an unhealthy diet can also increase your risk of developing kidney stones. If you eat a lot of protein and/or a lot of salty, sugary food, then you are at higher risk of developing kidney stones. Think about what you eat in a typical day to determine if this is one of your risk factors. Recent recommendations are to avoid sodas containing phosphoric, such as colas, as these increase the risk of kidney stones. Being obese is another risk factor for kidney stones. You are considered obese if your BMI is 30 or higher. Check your weight and BMI to determine whether or not this may be one of your risk factors for kidney stones. Keep in mind that if you have recently gained weight, then you may also be at risk of developing kidney stones, even if you are not obese. Some medical conditions and surgeries can also put you at higher risk of developing kidney stones. Consider your recent medical history to determine if any medical conditions or surgeries may have increased your risk for kidney stones. Some conditions and surgeries that can increase your risk of kidney stones include:  Inflammatory bowel disease Gastric bypass surgery Chronic diarrhea Hyperparathyroidism Urinary tract infection Cystinuria"

      "Pay attention to the feet! Shoes help complete the overall look in Paris. You’re not going to see a lot of Parisians slumming it around the city in tennis shoes. Cheap or scuffed shoes will give you away as a tourist.  Instead of throwing on tennis shoes, invest in a nice pair of leather shoes or, especially, ballerina flats. Black ballerina flats go with everything, and they are comfortable.  Leave the UGG boots and flip flops at home, too. You don’t need to wear heels that are too high. In Paris, it’s considered tacky to wear super high platform heels. When dressing down, you will likely see Parisians wearing the ballet flats, short boots or tall boots. When dressing up for a more formal event, women will wear lower high heels, but not wedge or spiked heels. Get your shoes shined, and take good care of them. One pair of expensive shoes that lasts forever is a good bet in Paris. Parisians wear nice shoes even when they are in casual settings because they believe that the shoes elevate the overall look. In Paris, you won’t see a lot of women wearing unnatural colors (think lime green) or anything too gaudy. The same is true with fabrics.  Avoid anything synthetic. Avoid distracting patterns, too. Instead, stick with classic neutral colors, such as navy, white, black, or tan colors.  One benefit of sticking with neutral colors is that you can easily mix and match them with other pieces of clothing. They’re versatile. Parisians choose neutral colors for both formal or informal settings. Mariner stripes are an exception to the no busy pattern rule. They are very Parisian, and they are worn in casual wear most frequently, paired with jeans or casual trousers. Parisian style is sometimes compared to New York style, and one thing they have in common is choice of color. The major color in any Parisian’s wardrobe is black.  You will see black worn in dresses, jackets, and trousers. Throw a white T-shirt or buttoned-down dress shirt under a black blazer and wear skinny black jeans, and you're set! Black is a slimming color, and it’s instantly sophisticated. When in doubt, wear black! One benefit of black is that it can work for more casual or formal settings. A black evening dress works well for a formal night out in Paris. The runner-up color most commonly seen in Parisian outfits is gray. Overall, the color palette in Paris is very understated and elegant. There is a basic style that you will see over and over again In Paris. If you want to master Parisian style, start with it. Consider it the typical Parisian's \"uniform.\"  The basic uniform is a blazer (very tailored), with skinny jeans, a T-shirt, and, if you’re a woman, ballet flats or heels. Again, think about wearing this uniform in the right colors – black or grey. Keep the accessories to a minimum to pull off the look. Go for a layered look, such as a shirt under a sweater and coat. Mix classy with casual. You want to look like you threw the outfit together. A great tailored blazer is a must. One of the most important things to Parisians is to make sure clothes fit well. Think tailored, not shapeless.  Ill-fitting dresses, pants that are too tight or too big, and dowdy, boxy jackets are all not going to cut it in Paris. French women dress for their body type, no matter what it is, and they enjoy slim-fitting clothing that accentuates curves. They don't try to hide their curves in too-baggy clothing. Clothing won't fit as well if you just get it off the rack. Parisians visit tailors. Some boutiques even tailor clothes on the spot. The seams will be stronger and better. The clothes will likely last longer. Parisians are known for their sex appeal, but they achieve this without showing too much skin. They dress for comfort, and they don't throw their sexuality in your face.  The rule is to not show too much of your legs, cleavage, or butt at one time. If you’re going to show a little leg, for example, don’t wear a low cut dress at the same time. If you’re trying too obviously to look sexy, that’s usually going to be less sexy, ironically. Too much cleavage is not common in Paris. Cramming yourself into a too-tight, too-revealing, too-short dress? That speaks more to Las Vegas than Paris. Learn to be sexy through understatement and confidence. In Paris, people tend to have a few staple items that are quite expensive. They actually save money in the long run because their clothes last longer.  However, they have fewer clothes overall and tend to wear the expensive staples over and over again for a better look. They mix and match and are not fans of wearing something once and then discarding it. Think of it this way. They have higher quality clothing but own less of it overall. They might purchase a $1,000 trench coat, but they’ll wear it for years. They will likely own a nice fitted dress shirt, a blazer, a great coat, and a pair of trousers. Think smart when you’re spending your money. You don’t need a lot of things; you just need a few good things. Shop at high-end stores that take pride in fine fabrics. Parisians will focus on the tiny aspects of an outfit or look to create an overall sophisticated and polished look.  Don’t go out with chipped nail polish, in a shirt that’s wrinkled, or in a shirt that’s ripped. Parisians will notice and think you're not respecting yourself. Women often choose formal dresses with subtle but intricate bead work or even a large white flower, bow, or brooch. Wear a scarf. Parisian women are very fond of scarves. It’s a signature accessory. Wear the scarf looped several times around your neck with a blazer and a T-shirt. It's one of the best known cliches about Parisians: That supposedly they wear berets. The problem is, it's not really true.  If you wear a beret in Paris, most people will probably recognize that you're a tourist. It's more the tourist's idea of Paris than the actual Parisian's. Instead of a beret, try wearing a fedora hat. Sophisticated hats are sometimes worn in Paris to elevate an outfit's look.  Another hat to avoid if you don't want to look like a tourist is a baseball cap. Put the baseball cap in the same category as tennis shoes: You won't look Parisian with them on. Men in Paris share a lot of dressing commonalities with their female counterparts: They dress somewhat formal even in casual settings, and they pay attention to fit and shoes.  Parisian men wear leather pointed shoes in neutral black or brown that lace up, for informal wear or formal nights out. Men tailor their clothes so that their trousers are cut more narrowly. They won’t have a sagging cuff, crotch or armpits. Scarves are not only for women in Paris. You will often see them on men, worn over a T-shirt or with a blazer. Parisian men prefer cotton, linens, cashmere, wool, denim and leather.  Parisian men wear clothing that highlights the silhouette. For men, jeans, a bomber jacket and T shirt can work well. Suits are important, as are linen shirts. French men also choose a fitted, slim style in their suits as well as their jeans.",
      "French women like to shampoo and then air dry their hair and then wait a day. They think their hair looks better on day two, and they’re not fans of blowouts.  If they do choose to dye their hair, they will likely keep it very close to the original color or to hide any gray. The look is natural and a little tousled. They get their hair cut frequently, and prefer short crops or hair that just hits the shoulder. They also don’t wash their hair every day. You will sometimes see French women pull their hair into a messy bun. Parisians think healthy hair and a good haircut are key and don’t load their hair with styling products or use a lot of heat on it. Keep the accessories out of your hair. No bows, headbands or clips! They also don’t leave the house with wet hair. Parisian women don’t worry that their hair is not immaculately kept in place. One natural hair mask they use is to mix together rum, honey, two egg yolks and lemon juice. Apply it to the hair for 30 minutes, and then rinse with cold water. French women rarely use hair dryers. Instead, they air dry their air and towel dry it as much as they can. French women aren’t big into eyeliner. They’re more into using the lips as the dominant feature when it comes to makeup. Classic red lipstick is used as a fashion accessory.  French women don’t think they need a lot of other makeup if they’re wearing red lipstick. It makes the only statement they need!  Don’t wear lip liner though. Keep your teeth white and clean by brushing them with baking soda once a week. White teeth with red lipstick is a better combination than coffee or cigarette-stained teeth would be. Play up your lips or eyes, but never both at the same time. If you play up both, the makeup will seem too obvious. To Parisians, great skin is a fashion statement, and they take care of their skin from an early age. Skin care is more important than makeup to Parisians. Skin should look natural.  It’s about accenting what you have naturally. Don’t contour your face. Dark shading ruins natural beauty and glow. French women might add highlights to the face, but they aren’t fans of contouring. Protect your skin. Parisians take great pride in trying to have healthy skin. They understand how dangerous the sun can be and don’t go out without a hat or sunscreen.  Use a mask on your skin once or twice a week, such as an acacia honey mask. Apply it, and then rinse off with cold water. French women don’t wear a lot of foundation. They wear a lot of moisturizer and do use concealer to hide imperfections. It’s considered very French to wear a smoky eye. Parisians will go for a messy looking smoky eye that has a cream-based texture to it.  Avoid glittery eye shadows, perfect lashes or too much makeup. French women are likely to use a single product. They will dab on a little blush and a little concealer and maybe some mascara. To create a smoky eye, apply kohl or gray eye shadow under the lower lash line and on the top lash line, and smudge it a little bit. French women also groom their eyelashes with brown pencil. They might add on a little lip balm. They aren’t fans of powder eye shadows.",
      "French people take pride in how they look, and they take pride in how they dress. You won’t see them dressing down for comfort outside the home.  For example, don’t wear yoga pants or hoodies to go to the coffee shop or grocery store. Pay attention to your dress at all times when outside the house. Take pride in what you’re wearing even for mundane activities and on typical days. It’s about an attitude. Even in casual wear, a Parisian is more likely to toss on a blazer (over a T-shirt) than wear a hooded sweatshirt. Carry yourself with confidence, and walk with your head held high and your posture straight, knowing that you’re dressed well and will command respect as a result. Parisians are not afraid to keep and show small physical imperfections, even though their clothing is impeccable. They are all about natural beauty.  Don’t worry if your nose is a bit big or your teeth crooked. For example, Vanessa Paradis is considered one of the world’s great French beauties, and she has never fixed the prominent gaps in her teeth. Along those same lines, don’t pluck your eyebrows too much or augment your lips with fillers. Try not to have more than two colors in your hair. The key to the entire style is to augment your natural beauty subtly and to do so in a way that doesn’t look like you are trying too hard. For French women, it’s about working with what they naturally have, not changing who they are or their overall look. French women eat what they want, but they exercise portion control and are known for their slim physiques.  They take great care of their hair and skin. French women grow bored by indoor workouts. They are not into the American workout regimen. You won’t see many of them in the gym. Instead, drink a lot of water. A key to beautiful skin is to drink water all day long. Mineral water spray can also spruce up the skin. The hair, skin, and body are the base for the overall Parisian style. Take care of your skin using cleanser, gel cream, and cleansing milk suitable for your skin type, oily, combination, normal, dry etc..  Eat organic food with little sugar. This will keep weight in check, but it also is good for your skin. What you put into your body will dictate whether your hair shines and your skin glows, not what you slather on or into it. French women know that to make a statement, you need a signature scent. They are well aware of the power of smell and use it to create sex appeal.  They will leave the house with a touch of perfume that they apply lightly, and they usually stick to a scent once they discover it. Dab perfume on the hair, behind the ear, on the back of your neck. Try to choose a scent that is not too overpowering and that you wear consistently. Chanel No. 5 is, of course, one of the most famous French perfumes. French women like perfume that is vanilla based or has a floral smell. They use it as a signature, and it helps form an identity. In Paris, less is more. French women aren’t going to leave the house with too much bling. French men won’t be seen with gaudy gold necklaces.  Before you leave home, try to remove one accessory. Don’t overload the look with too many pieces of jewelry, statement handbags, etc. Do try to have one accessory per outfit (belt, bracelet, etc.) French women keep their nails clean and sometimes wear polish. The French manicure is not really worn in Paris. Pedicures are important, though. French women will wear polish in neutral colors or even use clear gloss and won't be seen in neon. Instead, think of accessories from the standpoint of one great piece. Dramatic red lipstick might be your only needed accessory! It was fashion icon Coco Chanel who said you should remove one accessory before leaving the house. Great style in Paris is about how you put together the look and the quality of the clothes and fit. It’s not about the name brand.  Avoid the American temptation to flaunt labels on everything from handbags to blue jeans. That's considered tacky in Paris.  That doesn’t mean the French don’t have some iconic brands. They do. Think Louis Vuitton. It’s just that flaunting logos is not the key to Parisian style. Parisian style is about high quality clothing with great seams, classic lines and colors. It’s about achieving a vibe and look."

      "Espresso beans are roasted specifically for use in espressos, and will likely produce better results than ordinary coffee beans. While there are many, many varieties and blends of espresso bean, the most basic distinction is between the lighter Arabica and darker Robusta. While espresso is more concentrated and dark than regular coffee, this does not mean it needs to use blends high in Robusta beans. A blend with as little as 10-15% Robusta will produce a dark, \"biting\" espresso without additional, potentially unpleasant flavors from overuse. Find a dark spot at the back of your cupboard or pantry, not the fridge where it can pick up food smells and moisture. Use any container with an airtight, watertight seal. Even when stored this way, beans tend to lose quality rapidly after one or two weeks. Freezing may or may not affect the taste of espresso beans. Opening the container of frozen beans, however, causes harmful moisture to condense on the beans. Divide the espresso beans into multiple containers to limit the number of times each one is opened. Pack tightly to remove most of the air. Espresso will stay freshest as whole beans, not grounds. Try to use up all your grounds within a few days after they are ground for best results. If you are switching to a new coffee beans or blend and want to get a pure flavor, run a few beans through the grinder first to remove most of the coffee grit from the last variety you used. You can use this for espresso if you don't mind a mixed cup, or simply toss it in the compost or trash.",

    ],
    "document": [
      "Your crush may be the prettiest person in the woodwind section, but if you don’t know anything about her, how can you know if she’s someone you’d want to date? Try to notice the important things about her: if she treats her friends well; if she’s nice to little kids and less popular people; if she’s passionate about something cool. Make sure you like both her personality and her face before trying to date her.  If she's funny, notice what kind of jokes she makes. A nice person doesn't hurt other people's feelings to get laughs.  If she's smart, see if she helps others, too. If she walks the person sitting next to her through a math problem, it's a sign that she's kind, too. If you go to school together, or have friends in common, figure out a way to talk to your crush a bit in a low-pressure situation. For example, you and your lab partner could collaborate with her and her lab partner or a project. If you want to see her outside of school, maybe she and her friends can come out with you and your friends. Say \"Ellen and Tyree and I are going bowling after school--want to come with us? You can bring other people, too.\"  If you don’t have any mutual friends, start by talking to her, but skip the pick-up lines. Just smile, greet her by name, and ask about something you both have in common. Group hangs are fun, but they aren’t the same as dates. Remember that you aren’t on a date unless both people know it’s a date. Girls aren’t a different species, and they don’t need to be decoded. You won’t be able to know if she likes you just because she plays with her hair or touches your shoulder a certain amount of times. What you can tell is if she enjoys spending time with you. If her face lights up when she sees you, or if you have a great time swapping jokes whenever you hang out, you’re probably on the right track.  If a girl touches your arm or shoulder a lot, it’s a sign that she feels comfortable around you, which is a good sign.  If she initiates plans with you, such as asking to be conversation partners in Spanish class, that means she enjoys your company.  If conversation flows naturally when you’re together, you probably have both mutual interests and compatible communication styles. That’s also good news. Once you’re friendly, and if you’re still interested in your crush, take the next step and get her phone number. If you both hang out and talk already, this won’t be a outrageous request, so stay calm.  When you ask, say something simple and matter of fact, like “Can we trade numbers? I want to be the first to hear your opinions on the new Marvel movie.”  If you’re working on a project together, this’ll be even more natural. Say “We'll probably need to meet over the weekend to lay out the newspaper together. Can I text you?” You can also make this part of planning a group hang. Say “I’m stoked for the concert with you, Brian, and Jessica. Can I have your number so we can make sure we meet in the same place?”",
      "When you’ve started texting your crush, it’s best to begin in a friendly, open-ended way. A salutation and question initiates conversation, and allows you to gauge whether she’s busy or preoccupied. For example, send a text that says “Hi, what are you up to?” or “Hello, how are you today?”  Don’t just say “hi” or “hey.” It sounds lazy, and she might not know what to say in response.  Use follow-up questions to show your interest. Ask her to tell you more about her quirky dance teacher, her semifinal softball game, or what it’s like to babysit her little brother. Texting etiquette is complicated. For instance, everyone knows that ending every text with a period makes you sound angry. You don’t need to write an English paper, but do your best to check your spelling and not put commas where they don’t belong. This will show her that you like her enough to put thought into your writing. \"Hi, what's up? Is the math homework destroying you as badly as it's destroying me?\" looks a lot better than \"hi whats ^ is the math hmwrk killing u 2.\" Most people are more relaxed in the evening, following a busy day at school or work. You’ll have more time to respond to each other’s thoughts this way. Plus, communicating with her at night can feel more romantic than telling her you like her in broad daylight. Make sure not to text after bedtime, which can feel invasive. Wind down the texts after 10 PM or so. You want to be able to give your full attention to the conversation, and you want her to be able to give you attention too. This means that it's best not to text her when she's told you about other plans. If she’s told you that she’s going out with friends, for instance, give her a little space. You can always text her tomorrow and ask how her girl's-night-out went. It works the other way, too--don’t text her right before a movie if you know you’ll be distracted. The more upbeat and positive the conversation, the more receptive a girl will be when you tell her you like her. Try to stay away from negative topics that can ruin the mood, such as problems at school or work, or controversial subjects that can upset her and turn conversation sour.  Talk about pop culture you have in common. If you’re both giant Potterheads, ask how she feels about the new movie trailer. Joke about something in your daily life you both share. If the school lunch was an inedible casserole, ask if she’s having nightmares about it too. This shows you’re a good listener and that you care, and that you pay attention to everything she shares with you. For example, if she once mentioned that she likes bowling, ask about her highest score or favorite alley. This is often more effective than telling a girl you like her, because it shows you understand her and recognize her best qualities. For example, if you like her knowledge of comics, tell her that you learn something new about the X-Men every time you talk to her.  Avoid complimenting your crush’s physical characteristics, like her body or eyes, at this stage. It can come off as creepy.  If your crush has recently rocked a performance or other big event, congratulate her on her skills. Texting is fun, but too much of it can become really intense. If you’re texting your crush for several hours a day, it might be time to dial it back a bit. This is especially true if you seem to be putting more effort into your texts than she is.  If you text your crush twice and she doesn’t respond, back off for a while. If she’s into you, she’ll text you again when she’s ready. Don’t go too far in the other direction and never text her back. You may be trying to play it cool, but if she feels ignored, she’ll feel bad.",
      "You don’t need to write yourself a perfect script, but take a little time and figure out when and how to tell your crush that you’re into her. If you think ahead a little bit, you’re less likely to fumble and forget yourself, or blurt out something too intense (“I’ve had a crush on you for seven years!”). Consider that it’s often better to ask someone on a clearly-defined date. This way, you’re telling her that you like her and giving her an opportunity for an action plan. Rejection happens to everyone, and it’s not the end of the world. It’s easiest to say something like “Thank you for telling me! I enjoy hanging out with you as friends, so no worries,” take a bit of space, then return to the friendship after a couple weeks. This is a confident, indirect way to tell a girl you like her without actually saying you like her. Send this text after hanging out together, or even after an official date. For example, you could say something like “I had fun with you tonight and enjoyed your company! Can’t wait to do it again.” Be simple and direct. This shows that you’re confident and feel strongly enough about your feelings that you’re willing to admit it word for word. Make your statement more personal by sharing what you like most about her. For example, say “I’m into you because you're so passionate about social justice,” or “I like you because you're sunny enough to brighten anyone's day.” Just like with compliments, mention something specific about her personality that you like. For example, tell her that she cracks you up whenever you hang out, or that her commitment to saving the environment is powerful and cool. Now that you’ve laid your feelings bare, you probably want to take your relationship a step further by dating. The only way to date a girl is, of course, to go on a date with her. After you’ve told her you like her, invite her on an outing for just the two of you. Make it clear that it’s not a “group hang” or a casual thing--it’s a real date.  Suggest a specific date and time. This way, if she likes you but can’t make it, she’ll reschedule. If she’s not interested, it’ll be a lot easier on your feelings to hear “I’m sorry, I can’t make it” then “I don’t feel that way about you.”  Plan the date around things you both like, like mini-golf and milkshakes. There's no point in doing something neither of you like!"

      "Networking refers to connecting two or more computers to one another, usually for the purpose of sharing files between them. This concept also applies to network items (e.g., printers) which can be shared by any computers which are networked to the computer to which the printer is connected.  Networking usually requires that you enable settings on your computer which make it more vulnerable to outside interference. If you're going to network your computer, make sure it has a password. Networking can also apply to wireless connections, such as the ones used to connect one computer to an Internet modem. When connecting your computer to a wireless Internet connection (Wi-Fi), you'll need to know what the following terms mean:   Router — Connects to an Internet modem in order to broadcast a wireless Internet signal.  Modem — Bridges the connection between the hard-wired Internet cable and the router. Some routers and modems are built into the same unit.  SSID — The name of your wireless network.  Key — The password used to log into your wireless network. You can use Ethernet cables to connect two computers to one another, to connect a computer directly to the modem or router, or to connect a computer to another network item such as a printer. Using Ethernet generally leads to a more consistent connection between two items, but can also be limiting due to the fact that not all computers support Ethernet.  Ethernet cables can be found in tech stores and in online locations such as Amazon. If you're using a Mac laptop or some Microsoft notebook laptops, you most likely don't have an Ethernet port. You can solve this problem by buying a USB (Windows) or USB-C (Mac) Ethernet adapter and plugging it into your computer. . Connecting to Wi-Fi will vary slightly depending on your computer, but you'll usually click the Wi-Fi logo in your computer's taskbar or menu bar, click the name (SSID) for your preferred Wi-Fi network, enter the password for the network, and follow any on-screen instructions from there. Always make sure you're in range of the Wi-Fi network when connecting. In most cases, this means being within around 100 feet of the router, though being closer when first connecting is best. As mentioned earlier, networking your computer places it in a vulnerable state in which others can view your files. If your computer uses a password, this isn't a problem; however, failing to use a password means that anyone on your network who has your computer's username can view your computer's files. The same goes for your wireless network.",

      "A good relationship is based on teamwork, whether it's with your spouse, your little league coach or your work colleagues. A good team has a common goal. It knows its way to success is dependent on acknowledging the skills and abilities of each person, not insisting on things being done one way only. Find a suitable name for your chosen higher principle. Call it love, truth, or spirituality. Connect with your higher principle regularly and in all beautiful or difficult situations. Live in the center of your relationship, guided by your higher principle. Constant criticism of another suggests superiority and disdain; this condescension destroys love. When there is a place for criticism, provide it factually, sensitively and at the right moment. The basic rule for each relationship is least two thirds praise and less than one third constructive critique.   Compliment each other. Men love admiration. Women love gestures of affection. Look in the mirror. There are plenty of things that you know aren't promoting the best of yourself. Work on those aspects of yourself and learn from what others have to say too. Avoid cutting off your partner too often from his or her wishes. Say \"Yes\" as often as is possible. Every relationship requires effort. It isn't as simple as meeting someone, hitting off and hoping it'll stay strong. It requires a commitment from both parties to care, nurture and work through issues that assail the relationship from time to time.  Marriage is work. It is a false way of comprehending the purpose of marriage that you can completely let go of yourself at home. It takes some effort to make a relationship succeed, and you have to decide if you're willing to put in that work. Spend regular time undertaking certain activities that make you and your partner happy. For example, sex, dining, travel, excursions and a common hobby. Do not demand too much from a partner, life or even from yourself. Anyone who cannot limit his or her wishes risks being permanently unhappy. If you do not know the point of satisfaction, you will never be satisfied. Where is your end point? Clarify the precise factual situation. Think about different solutions. Find the good common ground.  Put boundaries on the negative behaviors from partners and others in your life. Tantrums, violations of positive life principles, etc. are not acceptable ways to interact. Do not reward negative behavior––stay neutral or say a firm \"No\". If you are an aggressive person, find a way to tone this down before interacting. Come to peace within yourself before communicating with others. Love grows on the basis of non-violence, wisdom and gentleness. Live in truth. Truth is the basis of every good relationship. Take your partner as she or he is. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. No person is perfect. Love means to love the other person, along with his or her weaknesses. Accept the smallness in you, then you can take it in your fellow person."

      "Limiting Foods that Can Damage Your Heart",
      "Following a Heart-Healthy Diet",
      "Following a Heart Healthy Lifestyle"
    ],
    "document": [
      "There are a variety of foods in the typical American or Western diet that should be limited or avoided due to their link to heart disease.  Trans fats in particular are one of the worst foods for your heart.  The majority of trans fats are very processed and are a man-made fat.  Very few trans fats occur naturally.  They're typically labeled as \"hydrogenated oil\" or \"partially hydrogenated oils\" on the food label. These fats are considered the worst by health professionals.  They raise your LDL (or bad cholesterol) and decrease your HDL (good cholesterol).  The most common sources of trans fat are:  fried foods, fast foods, baked goods and pastries, creamer and margarine, pre-made cookie dough or biscuit dough, and snack foods like chips, crackers or buttery popcorn. There is no safe limit for trans fats.  You want to avoid them as much as possible. Saturated fat is another type of fat that health professionals typically want limited in your diet.  Although not considered as unhealthy as trans fats, it's still important to limit your total saturated fat intake.  Unlike trans fats, saturated fats occur naturally.  They typically occur in animal products like full-fat dairy products, fatty red meat, skin on poultry and fatty cuts of pork.  Saturated fat has been shown to increase your LDL levels (the bad cholesterol); however, it does not affect your HDL levels.  Some studies have also shown that high quantities of saturated fat may increase your risk for type 2 diabetes.  Health professionals recommend limiting your total saturated fat intake to less than 10% of your total calories.  If you're eating 2,000 calories daily, you shouldn't consume more than 22 g of saturated fat daily. In addition to limiting saturated fats and cutting out trans fats, it's also important to moderate your total sodium intake.  Although sodium doesn't have a direct effect on your heart, other conditions it causes do.  A high sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure and stroke.  High blood pressure can severely damage your heart and arteries over time.  Reducing salt may reduce blood pressure in normotensive, prehypertensive, and hypertensive individuals.  It's recommended to limit your sodium intake to 2,300 mg daily or less.  Some of the foods highest in sodium or salt include:  breads, restaurant foods (especially fast foods), deli meat, frozen meals, canned goods, processed meats, condiments and sauces, chips, pretzels and pizza. A very specific food that has been more recently linked to heart disease is red meat — especially fatty cuts of red meat.  Limit your intake of beef as this can lead to heart disease.  A recent study showed that when people ate red meat regularly, they showed increased levels of a compound that is directly linked with the development of heart disease.  If you currently eat red meat on a regular basis, consider moderating how much you eat and switch to lean cuts.  Cut your consumption down to one serving a week or one serving every other week. .  There are many studies that suggest that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol may produce some protective benefits to the heart; however, drinking more alcohol than recommended or on a regular basis can actually cause heart disease.  Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol is defined as drinking two or less drinks daily for men and one or less drinks daily for women.  Drinking three or more drinks at a time has a direct toxic effect to the heart.  Heavier drinking like this can lead to high blood pressure, enlarge the heart muscle and weaken it over time. Although there are some benefits to very small amounts of alcohol, it's still best to limit your overall consumption and consume a maximum of one to two drinks occasionally, not daily. Sweetened beverages have been linked to many adverse health effects like obesity and diabetes and can also lead to heart disease.  A recent study that was conducted showed that consuming 2 sweetened beverages daily increased the risk of heart disease and heart failure by 25%.  Limit drinks with added sugars or high amounts of sugar like:   sodas, fruit juices, fruit juice cocktails, sweetened coffee drinks, sweet tea, sports drinks, energy drinks and punch. Instead, try aiming for 64 oz of water, sparkling water, unsweetened decaf coffee, tea or a combination of all of these.",
      "Measure portions and be mindful of calories so you can maintain a healthy weight.  If you gain weight, are overweight or obese your risk for heart disease increases.  If you're looking to avoid foods that could damage your heart, you should also focus on foods and an eating pattern that can protect your heart.  Measuring the appropriate portion sizes of foods and counting calories can help keep your weight in check or even help you lose weight. Your total meal portion size should be between one to two cups total.  Use a food scale or measuring cups to keep yourself on track. You may also want to count calories.  You can use an online calculator to figure out how many calories you need daily.  In general women need about 1,800 calories daily and men need about 2,200 calories daily. Since trans fats, saturated fats and red meat should either be avoided or minimized in your diet, you'll need to focus on other protein sources instead.  Stick to lean protein options to help support your healthy weight and your heart.  Lean proteins are naturally lower in calories and fat - especially the unhealthy types of fat.  This makes them a preferable choice for your heart healthy diet. Leaner protein sources include:  poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean cuts of beef, lean pork, seafood, tofu and legumes. Also make sure to measure your protein.  Measure out about 3–4 oz or about a 1/2 cup of items like beans or lentils. Although fats like trans fat and saturated fat are things you want to avoid or minimize, there are actually some types of fat that you want to include in your diet.  These are typically referred to as \"heart healthy\" fats.  There are two groups of heart healthy fats that you should focus on:  monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.  Both offer great benefits to your heart.  Monounsaturated fats are found in foods like:  olive oil, canola oil, sesame oil and peanut oil.  Cook with these oils, use them in salad dressings or drizzle over steamed vegetables. Polyunsaturated fats include omega-3 fats and are found in foods like:  salmon, mackerel, tuna, avocado, nuts and seeds.  Include fatty fish a few times a week, add avocados to your salad or top your yogurt with nuts or seeds. In addition to including lean protein and healthy fats, you want to aim to make half of your plate a fruit or a vegetable.  Both of these food groups are heart healthy foods.  Fruits and vegetables are great for your heart and overall health.  They're low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.  When you make half of your meals a fruit or vegetable, you help control the overall calories and nutrition of your meal. The antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables (not antioxidant supplements) have been shown to have a protective effect against your heart.  Also measure out the portion sizes for your fruits and vegetables.  You should go for 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens and 1/2 cup of fruit. 100% whole grain foods are not only good for your GI system, but also great for your heart and arteries. Make sure when you're choosing to eat a grain, you go for whole grain to reap these great benefits.  100% whole grains are minimally processed and still include all 3 nutritious parts of the grain — the bran, germ and endosperm.  These grains are high in fiber, minerals and even protein.  Eating appropriate servings of whole grains can help reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke and helps maintain a healthy weight. Make sure to measure your grains.  Go for about 1 oz or 1/2 cup of cooked grains per serving. You might be surprised that drinking adequate fluids is also important for a healthy heart.  Drink up to help maintain good heart health.  If you're dehydrated, it's harder for your heart to pump blood.  It's puts a big strain on your heart making it work harder and beat faster.  When you're properly hydrated, your heart pumps blood easily to the muscles.  To make sure you're getting adequate fluids, aim to consume a minimum for 64 oz or 8 glasses daily.  However, many people may need upwards of 13 glasses daily.  Stick with sugar-free and decaf beverages like water, sparkling water, flavored water or decaf coffee or tea.",
      "Getting regular physical activity is an important part to a healthy lifestyle.  In addition, regular physical activity is important to maintain heart health.  Health professionals suggest being active at least three to four times a week.  This amount of exercise has been shown to help lower your blood pressure, lower your cholesterol and help you maintain a healthy weight.  Specifically, it's important to aim for about 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio activity each week.  You can walk, jog, dance, use the elliptical or go hiking.  In addition to cardio, add in one to two days of strength or resistance training.  Try yoga, weight lifting or pilates. .  Smoking is a well known cause of many chronic and very serious health conditions. There is a direct link to smoking and heart disease.  Studies have shown that smoking causes the hardening of arteries and build of plaque as well.  This can lead to heart attacks and strokes.  Quit smoking as soon as possible.  Cold turkey is the quickest way to quit; however, it's also the most difficult. If you're having difficulty quitting, consider seeing your primary care doctor for help.  He or she may be able to provide you with medication to help you quit or refer you to a smoking cessation program. Maintaining a healthy weight is important to your general health.  It also plays a serious role in the prevention of heart disease.  If you're overweight or obese, you're at a higher risk for high cholesterol, high blood pressure and insulin resistance.  These are the same risk factors for heart disease.  Determine if your at a healthy weight by figuring out what your BMI is.  You can use online calculators to figure out your BMI.  If your BMI is between 25.0-29.9 you're considered overweight.  If it's above 30.0 you're considered obese.  If you've determined you're overweight or obese, consider losing some weight to help you reach a healthier weight. Talk to your doctor about appropriate weight loss programs or diets to help reduce your weight and your risk for heart disease. .  A more unusual risk of heart disease is stress.  Studies have shown that stress can influence your risk for a variety of health conditions including heart disease.  Stress is something we must all deal with, but many people choose to overeat, smoke, drink or be physically inactive when they're feeling stressed.  These are all behaviors that can increase your risk of heart disease.  Talk to friends or family members, go for a walk, listen to calming music, do yoga, meditate or take a hot shower to help reduce your stress. Chronic stress has been linked to high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  Stressful work and demanding jobs have also been linked to high blood pressure. Stress resulting from job loss, too, can affect blood pressure.  If you're having difficulty reducing stress, consider talking to a therapist or counselor for additional stress management techniques."

      "For the record, this isn't a very strong dye and is only suitable for light colored wood, such as pine. The end result will look \"weathered.” Make sure it is as strong a brew as possible; the darker the coffee, the darker the dye effect. Dyeing a dining room table that seats 14? You may need more than just a pot. These will be used as part of the dye, making it richer and deeper – and that translates to fewer coats for you to spread. Before you go to dip your rag or paintbrush in the coffee, you may want to put on rubber or plastic gloves to keep coffee stains off your hands. While the coffee is still warm (not hot), use a paintbrush or rag dipped into the coffee and apply it to the wood. Rub or paint back and forth, across the wood. Don't worry about the grounds; press them in if you can but just keep moving back and forth. Leave the grounds in place for darker dyeing. If you're working with a smaller object, arrange on paper towels or towels to dry. Some coffee may drip down the sides, depending on your process. This is generally fine, as it will give it a perfectly-imperfect look. After a few layers, the effect can be quite evident. Reheat the coffee until it's warm again to bring back its potency, and reapply.  Remember to let it dry before you apply another layer. It will be slightly darker when wet. If you like the current shade, consider sealing it with polyurethane spray or a wood varnish. This will help the color last longer, give it a sheen, and protect it against the elements.",
      "This is great as an at-home DIY project or even as a craft project with kids – liquid watercolors are non-toxic and fun and easy to use. Here’s what you’ll need:  Pieces of wood Liquid watercolors Bowls, cups, or ice tray Wax paper Paintbrushes (optional) An ice cube tray is convenient as you can put small amounts of each color into each little container, but if you need a wider area (for dipping, etc.) you’ll be better off with a wider-brimmed bowl. The beauty of liquid watercolor is that it is good to go. No mixing or heating up necessary. When you pour it in, that's all you need to do. It lasts much longer than food coloring and is cheaper, too. That’s really all it takes – at least at first. Dip it in for just a few seconds and see what you think of the color. Remember: it will get lighter as it dries.  It’s not a bad idea to dip in one side and set the wood down to dry on a side that isn’t dyed yet. Then you know whichever side it lays on won’t get tarnished or stick to the surface when laid down. If the color is too light, dip it in for a few seconds once more, applying another coat. If you're worried about getting it on your fingers, put on a pair of rubber or plastic gloves. However liquid watercolors do wash off pretty easily if addressed quickly. Keep this in mind for your objects, too. If they get exposed to water, the dye could start coming off – at least eventually. It's important they stay dry (out of water and out of mouths). Once you’re finished dyeing, set all the pieces on wax paper to dry overnight. Come back to them in the morning and see if you like the color. If not, you can always reapply.",
      "It’s best to cover wherever you’re working with a plastic cloth – newspapers may soak through. Cover your hands, too, with rubber gloves; if you don’t, you’ll end up with fun-colored fingers by the end of the project. To get started, you'll need:  One container for every color of dye Paintbrushes Hot water Polyurethane spray (optional) If you’re working with a piece of scrap wood, it may have to be sanded and wiped clean. If it has a varnish, you’ll need to strip it and sand it until smooth. Wood bought from craft supply stores (blocks or beads, for example) is ready to go. If you haven't yet purchased wood and are looking to do so from a home improvement store, ask if they'll sand it for you. Mix the dye according to the package instructions – you’ll probably need ½ cup liquid dye or 1 box of powder dye with 2 cups of very hot water. Use a glass or ceramic bowl to avoid reactions with the dye colors in the microwave and stir well.  If you’re using the immersion method, you’ll need the same amount of dye with 2 ‘’quarts’’ of water (depending on the size of your product). There are many different types of wood dyes out there, and some are just wood stains. Rit dye, like the kind you'd buy for fabric, makes a great, easy-to-use, cheap dye for woods that's widely available in craft supply stores. Dip a piece of scrap wood (or use an area of the wood you’re using that can’t be seen) into the bowl of dye. Give it a minute or two to dry as it’s darker when wet. If you don’t like it, add more dye or more water as needed. This won't give you the exact final hue, but it'll be close. It'll also show you how the dye spreads and how you have to apply the dye to get the look you want. There are a number of methods you can use:   Brush-on method. Dip a foam or bristle brush or old cloth in the dye and spread it evenly over your wood surface. If dye drops splash onto your wood, you can get rid of them by sanding the wood immediately. Let it dry and reapply as necessary.  Immersion method. Place the wood gently into the prepared dye. Leave in for as long as it takes to achieve the desired color (likely 10-20 minutes. Keep in mind that the colors dry much lighter than they appear when wet.  Weather-beaten look. Chose two dye colors to apply one after the other. Start with the lighter shade and let dry. Then apply the darker shade and let dry. Once it is dry, lightly sand the entire piece, exposing the lighter shade underneath. Repeat applications as necessary. Rub with sandpaper or steel wool to create shaded areas when finished. Remove the wood from the dye when you're satisfied it is ready. Lay it out to dry on paper towels or some other suitable surface that it won’t stick to. Then, leave it overnight for best results. Polyurethane can also be applied with a new bristle or foam brush. This can be useful if the wood object is to undergo wear and tear through frequent usage, such as for beads in jewelry. Keep in mind that this method is not safe to use with baby's toys or other objects that may get placed in the mouth.",
      "Cover the surface with paper or some other suitable material, like a plastic tablecloth, to protect the area from getting stained. You might want to wear rubber gloves, too. You'll also need:  One container for each dye Warm or hot water Plastic bags (if immersing) The more dye that you add, the more saturated the color will be (and the less water you use, too). Light wood works the best with food coloring as it takes on color much more easily.  Mix it up well – food coloring has a tendency to take a while to dissolve if it isn't given a push in the right direction. The darker (and bigger) the wood and the more water you have, the more dye you will need. Be prepared to clean out your stock in your kitchen for the craft. A resealable plastic bag is ideal for immersing the wood, depending on how large the piece of wood is. If it is really large, use a plastic tub. You can also use a foam brush to apply the dye. This makes it easier to control and is better for smaller objects that have nooks and crannies. It does take a bit more patience, however. The longer it sits, the more saturated the color will be. Want it bright and vibrant? Leave it in, go watch an episode of your favorite TV show, and then come back and check on it.  If you're using the brush-on method, you'll probably need at least 3 or 4 coats to get a significant color. Apply the first coat around the entire object before you move onto the 2nd to ensure an even look. Keep in mind that the color will lighten as it dries. Use paper towels or some other surface you're okay staining. Leave at least overnight, and check in the morning. If it's gotten too light, you can simply apply another coat or two. If you're happy with the color, considering sealing it in by spraying the surface with a polyurethane spray. You can also take a brush to spread it on. This adds a varnish or shine to the object in addition to providing a seal against general wear and tear.",
      "Before doing anything with the wood, you should have a suitable place to work in, where you can make a mess and it doesn't matter. Use a table or other surface that is comfortable to work on and that you’re okay getting a splash of dye on. Cover it with a plastic cloth or some other protective surface. You'll probably want to put on an old t-shirt and some plastic or rubber gloves, too. With rubber gloves on to prevent staining your hands and fingers, add a package of drink powder to water to create a dye. Adjust your ratio of water to powder until you get the shade that you want.  Cherry drink powder will come out red, grape will come out purple, etc. If you want a darker, deeper shade, just add less water. You can also combine colors (red and yellow make orange, for example) if the color you want is unavailable in flavor form. The best perk of using drink powder as your dye? It smells delicious. Using a foam brush, spread the paint everywhere on the wood, wherever you need the dye to be applied. It will soak right in and smell fruity too. Remember that it will get lighter as it dries, so wait a minute to see if you need to apply another coat or two. You'll probably need a couple of layers, so be patient. Be sure to coat the entirety of the wood before you move onto coating it a second time to keep the color even. Wait for 16-20 minutes after you have finished spreading the dye. This will give the dye time to soak into the wood. Then, put the drying wood in a sunny or windy place to dry quickly. When that time is up, your art is ready. Check the color. When the wood dries completely, see if the color is dark enough for your liking. If it isn't dark enough, dye the wood again."

      "Making your own remineralizing toothpaste is easy and it only takes a few ingredients. You can use this toothpaste in place of your normal toothpaste, but keep in mind that this recipe does not contain any fluoride and being abrasive should not be used for more than 3 to 4 weeks in a row. Fluoride is an important mineral for reversing tooth decay and protecting your teeth from further damage. To make your own remineralizing toothpaste you will need:  4 tablespoons of calcium (carbonate) powder (crush calcium carbonate tablets or buy calcium powder in bulk). 2 tablespoons of baking soda. ½ to 1 packet of stevia. 1 teaspoon sea salt. 1/4 cup of coconut oil. a few drops of peppermint oil (optional). You can just use a strong fork to mix everything together. Make sure that they are well combined and that you have created a uniform paste. If the paste looks too thick, then you can add another tablespoon or two of coconut oil to thin it out.  Transfer the paste to a mason jar and seal it tightly when you are finished. Use the paste just like your regular toothpaste. The toothpaste will keep longer in the refrigerator, but you will need to set it out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to use it so that the coconut oil can return to room temperature. Otherwise, the paste may be too solid to use.",
      "Regular daily brushing is crucial for maintaining good dental health and it may also help to reverse the decay process. Make sure that you brush your teeth at least twice per day, such as in the morning and before you go to bed.  Choose a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Fluoride is necessary for remineralizing teeth and reversing tooth decay. It can also help to protect your teeth from future decay.  Use a soft bristle toothbrush. Hard-bristled toothbrushes can damage your teeth and gums.  Brush all surfaces of your teeth (front, back, and tops). Use short, swift strokes as you brush your teeth. You should spend about two minutes brushing, and for a better action you can also leave the toothpaste in your mouth for the next two minutes before rinsing so fluoride can remineralize your enamel. Flossing is important because a toothbrush does not clean between your teeth, but bacteria often hides between your teeth and causes tooth decay. That is why you need to floss between your teeth at least once per day as well.  To floss your teeth, wrap and 18 inch piece of floss around each of your index fingers. Then, use the floss to clean between all of your teeth. As you floss your teeth, try to rub the floss up and down the sides of your teeth to pull out any remaining plaque underneath your gums. Do not just move the floss back and forth. Try using a water flosser if you have trouble using floss. For people who have braces or other dental work that gets in the way, a water flosser can be a useful tool for cleaning between your teeth using the pressure of water to stimulate the blood flow in the gums for better protection against bacteria. Mouthwash can help to reduce decay causing kill bacteria inside of your mouth, so it is a great addition to your dental hygiene routine. Some mouthwashes also contain fluoride, so they can help to strengthen your teeth as well.  To use mouthwash, pour the recommended amount into the cap (usually about 30 mL) and then swish the amount in your mouth for about one minute. After you have finished swishing the mouthwash, spit it out. Do not swallow the mouthwash. Do not rinse with water afterwards so the antibacterial effect will last longer. If the mouthwash is too strong and gives a burning feeling, then dilute it with 50:50 water. Regular visits to your dentist will also help to protect against tooth decay. Make sure that you visit your dentist for a cleaning and exam at least twice per year to stay on top of your dental health. Ask your dentist about fluoride treatments and other protective measure for your teeth. Your dentist can even apply a dental sealant to your teeth to help protect them from tooth decay.",
      "Vitamin D and calcium are essential to healthy teeth, so getting enough of these two vital nutrients may help to reverse tooth decay. Make sure that you are getting plenty of vitamin D and calcium from your diet, supplements, and other sources.  To get more calcium and vitamin D in your diet, try to eat two to three servings dairy products each day, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. You can also look for a daily multi-vitamin that includes 100% of your recommended daily intake of calcium and vitamin D. You can also spend 10 to 15 minutes in the sun each day to get your recommended daily intake of vitamin D. Just make sure that you put on sunscreen if you will be out in the sun for longer than 15 minutes. If your body has plenty of minerals, including calcium, then you will see an increased rate of calculus deposits on the back side of your lower front teeth, this means you will have to go for a professional cleaning at least twice a year. Carbonated and sugary beverages can lead to tooth decay, so make sure that you avoid these if you are trying to reverse tooth decay. You should also try to avoid fruit juices, sodas, sports drinks, and any other fizzy or sweetened beverages. Instead of drinking soda, try drinking water flavored with a few berries or sip some unsweetened iced tea with a sprig of mint. Tea (hot or cold) contains polyphenols, which seem prevent bacteria from producing acids that lead to tooth decay. The antibacterial effect is from the increased hydration of your body and this results in a higher flow of saliva. Citrus fruits contain a lot of acid, which can increase tooth decay. While you are trying to reverse your tooth decay, stop drinking citrus fruit juices and limit citrus fruits to a couple of servings per week. Citrus fruits include:  Lemons. Limes. Oranges. Tangerines. Grapefruits. Sugar is a major culprit of tooth decay so try to eliminate as many sources of sugar from your diet as possible. Instead of adding sugar to your foods and beverages, try using stevia (a calorie-free herbal sweetener) or honey (an antibacterial sweetener) to sweeten your foods and beverages. Foods that are highly processed are more likely to contain extra sugars and lots of starch, which can get stuck in your mouth (making them hard to remove) promote the growth of decay causing bacteria. To reduce these sources of tooth decay, stop eating processed foods as much as possible. Instead, stick to whole foods such as:  Whole grains. Lean meats. Vegetables. Fruits. Dairy products."

    "document": [
      "Your job is a lot easier if you know he likes you. If he smiles at you or goes out of his way to see you or spend time with you, these are good signs that he’s interested. He might tell you he likes you or you might find out from a friend that he likes you. Your biggest job now is building your confidence to tell him you feel the same way. If he doesn’t know who you are or sees you as a friend, then you have some more work to do. As a shy person, you’ll probably want to be flirty before going up to a guy and telling him you like him. Gauge his interest and see if he flirts back. In many ways, “actions speak louder than words” so let your non-verbals do the work. Try some basics of flirting such as laughing at a joke he makes or touching him lightly on the arm. This can drop the hint that you’re interested. Notice how he responds and whether he moves toward you or moves away from you. You don’t have to be over-the-top. Being subtle can almost be better, as you might carry some mystery. Part of your shyness might be imagining the worst that could happen. But what really is the worst thing that might occur? Be realistic and rational. He might say he doesn’t feel the same, but it’s highly unlikely he’ll make fun of you or embarrass you. If he does embarrass you, this reflects more on him being a jerk than anything else and others will see that, too. Instead of making the situation difficult or scary, frame it as a challenge. Are you up for the challenge? Whatever happens, you’ll know you pushed yourself out of your comfort zone. Give yourself credit for trying, even if it doesn’t turn out the way you want it to.",
      "Maybe you’re too shy to come right out and say, “I like you.” Another option is to invite him to spend some time with you. Keep in mind that it’s okay for girls to ask out boys (and for boys to ask out boys). Spending time with him will help you gauge how he feels about you and whether you should start spending more time with him.  This shows him that you want to spend time with him and get to know him better.  For example, ask him to go to a dance or to a sports game with you. Say, “I got two tickets to see the basketball game on Friday, and I was hoping you’d be free. What do you say?” As a shy person, you might do best by preparing to tell him you like him. Decide that you want to do it, then act on it. For example, decide on a specific day and time to tell him you like him. Do something to help you follow through, like writing it down in your planner. For example, if there's a party on the weekend that you know he's going to be at, tell yourself, \"All right. I'm going to keep an eye out for him. When I see him, I'm going to wander over and bump into him, then I'm going to tell him.\" No need to have his friends eavesdropping or casually listening in. As a shy person, you don't need an audience! He will also appreciate your tact and respect for his privacy. Read the situation and pinpoint an appropriate time to talk. If he’s in the middle of talking to somebody, wait for a few moments. Once they walk away, it’s your chance to approach him. Don’t let your conversation drag on too long without telling him you like him. He might become disinterested or the conversation might fall flat. You can start by saying, \"Hey Xavier, you got a moment? There's something I'd like to say to you.\" Then follow by saying, \"I've been enjoying spending time around you a lot lately. And I just wanted to let you know that I like you. I was hoping you might feel the same way.\"",
      "Making eye contact is an easy and subtle way to let him know you like him. Make the most of your opportunities to look him in the eye. For example, if he says hello to you, look him in the eyes while you say hello back. You can act a bit coy by dropping your gaze, then looking back up at him with a smile.  If he makes eye contact back, chances are he finds you attractive. Try to hold your gaze with him for one to two seconds. Don't stare though! See how he responds––does he smile back, look away or just stare vacantly? Try to gauge his willingness to interact with you. . You might be too shy to come right out and say, “I like you.” If this sounds like you, you might want to hint at your feelings instead of putting your feelings on the line. However, be aware that he might not pick up on your feelings if you’re not outright. You can hint your feelings by saying something like, “I really like spending time with you” or, “It would be fun if we were lab partners.” If you’re shy, it might be difficult for you to go up to the guy, especially if he’s around other people much of the time. Texting can be an easier way to flirt and interact with him without having to worry about awkward pauses or not knowing what to talk about. If you’re texting back and forth with him, use the opportunity to slip in some hints.  Just talking to him over text shows interest. If you want to go a level up, say, “By the way, I think you’re cute.” You can even come right out and say, “I like you” over text once you build your courage. Maybe going up to him and saying that you like him might overwhelm you or fill you with fear. If you see the guy at school (or out of school) regularly, you might want to slip him a note. This way, you won’t have to stumble over your words or ‘blank out.’ if you write a note, you’ll also be able to write a few drafts before settling on one you like and are ready to give to him.  Start by giving him a note and see if he writes back. If you pass a couple notes, you might want to tell him you like him in the next note. Spend some time writing your note and deciding what to say. You might want to make it short and sweet or lay out your feelings. It’s up to you what you want to say in your note, just make sure you tell him you like him. If you want to show him you care but just cannot get yourself to come out and say it, send him something and sign it from a secret admirer. Send him a favorite food (like hot sauce or chocolate) or something you know he’ll like. Send a card and simply sign it, “Your secret admirer.” If you send him something from a secret admirer, try to ask him about it and see how he feels. You will likely need to tell him at some point it was you."

      "It takes about a week for symptoms to appear after an individual is infected. The symptoms presented by those infected with dengue determine its severity and the treatment plan. After you've been bitten by a dengue-infected mosquito, symptoms will appear typically four to seven days later. These symptoms generally last about three to ten days. There are two major classifications of dengue: without and without warning signs.  Dengue without warning signs is usually identified by the presence of a fever (40 degrees Celsius/104 degrees Fahrenheit) and two or more of the following: nausea or vomiting; a rash that causes the face to redden and red patches to develop on arms, legs, chest, and back; body ache and pain; low white blood cell count; swelling of glands in the neck and behind the ear.  Dengue with warning signs is classified similarly to dengue without warning signs, but patients in this category exhibited one or more of the following: abdominal pain; persistent vomiting; fluid accumulation in abdomen and lungs; bleeding from gums, eyes, nose; lethargy or restlessness; enlarged liver.  Such warning signs indicate that the dengue infection may be serious and could progress to associated bleeding and organ failure, or what is called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). If one or more of the above symptoms are present, the subsequent 24-48 hours of dengue infection could be lethal without proper hospital care. Severe dengue includes symptoms from both of the above classifications along with any of the following:  Severe bleeding or blood in urine Severe fluid accumulation in abdomen, lung Loss of consciousness Involvement of other organs, such as heart, leading to further fluid accumulation, low pressure, high pulse rate If any of these symptoms are present, take the person immediately to the nearest hospital. All patients with severe dengue or dengue that presents with warning signs should go to the hospital as soon as possible. Those who present without warning signs should also visit the hospital for a thorough check-up and confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment can take place either at home or in hospital. For severe cases or those that exhibit warning signs, dengue must be treated in hospital.  Home care is an an option only if the patient meets the following three requirements: 1) there are no warning signs present; 2) the patient can tolerate adequate fluids orally; 3) the patient can pass urine at least every six hours.  Note that there is no specific medication or cure for dengue. Treatment mostly focuses on treating the symptoms of dengue.",
      "While treating dengue patients at home, it's important to prevent further contact with mosquitoes because the infection can spread from person-to-person via mosquitoes. In other words, controlling mosquitoes is key to preventing others from becoming ill.  Use window and door screens at home to prevent mosquitoes from entering. Use mosquito nets while sleeping. Wear clothes that minimize skin exposure to mosquitoes. Apply mosquito repellent to exposed skin. Repellants like DEET, picaridin, and oil of lemon eucalyptus are effective. Children should not handle repellents. Adults should apply repellents to their own hands first and spread them on the child’s skin. Do not use repellents on children under two months old. Prevent the breeding of mosquitoes by draining stagnant water around the house and cleaning water storage containers frequently. Dengue patients must go to the hospital every day to have their fever and blood count assessed. These daily visits must occur as long as the patient exhibits a fever of more than 37.5 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). This monitoring at the hospital can cease after there has been no fever over a 48-hour period. Permit the patient to slowly resume his previous activities, particularly during the long period of convalescence. Because dengue often causes significant tiredness and lethargy, it's important that patients get plenty of rest and progress back into their daily routines with caution. This medication will help treat the fever. Give one tablet of 325 to 500 mg. A total of four tablets can be given to the patient in one day. Do not give the patient aspirin, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These can increase the risk of bleeding in those with dengue. Patients should be encouraged to drink water, fruit juice, and oral rehydration solutions to prevent dehydration from fever or vomiting.  Adequate fluid intake decreases the chance that a patient with dengue will have to be hospitalized. Men and women (ages 19 to 30 years) should aim to drink three liters and 2.7 liters of water per day, respectively. Boys and girls should have 2.7 and 2.2 liters of water daily, respectively. For infants, the intake is 0.7-0.8 liters/day. You can also prepare a juice using papaya leaves for dengue patients. Papaya leaf extract has been reported to increase platelet count in dengue patients., although there is not yet firm clinical research to support this. Maintaining a daily record will help you observe any worsening of symptoms. It's important to monitor children and babies closely since they are more likely to develop more serious cases of dengue. Keep clear notes on the following:  The patient's temperature. Since temperature varies during the day, it is preferable to record it at same time daily. This will make your daily reading reliable and valid. Fluid intake. Ask the patient to drink from the same cup each time; this will make it easier for you to remember and keep track of the total volume consumed. Urine output. Ask the patient to urinate into a container. Measure and record the amount of urine each time. These containers are commonly used at hospitals to measure 24-hour urine output. You will be provided with one or can inquire about it at the hospital. Head to the hospital immediately if the patient exhibits any of the following signs:  High fever Severe abdominal pain Persistent vomiting Cold and clammy extremities (could be due to dehydration or blood loss) Lethargy Confusion (as a result of poor water intake or blood loss) Inability to pass urine regularly (at least every 6 hours) Bleeding (vaginal and/or bleeding, bleeding from nose, eyes or gums, red spots or patches on skin) Difficulty in breathing (due to fluid collection in lungs)",
      "To treat severe cases of dengue fever at a hospital, doctors will begin by introducing intravenous (IV) fluids and electrolytes (salts) into the patient's body. This treatment works to replace the fluids lost through vomiting or diarrhea. This step will only be taken if the patient is not able to take fluids orally (e.g., because of severe vomiting) or is in shock.  Intravenous means \"within a vein.\" In other words, liquid substances will be infused directly into one of the patient's veins via a syringe or intravenous catheter.  The recommended first-line IV fluid is crystalloids (0.9% saline).  Doctors will monitor the patient's fluid intake through IV due to newer guidelines recommending a more cautious intake of IV fluids than in the past. This is because overhydration can cause adverse effects, including intravascular fluid overload, or a flooding of the capillaries. For this reason, in most cases, doctors will administer fluid in increments, rather than a constant flow. In more advanced and severe cases cases of dengue, doctors may have to perform a transfusion to replace lost blood. This is often the required treatment for patients whose dengue has escalated to DHF. A transfusion can entail transfer of fresh blood into the patient's system or just platelets, which are parts of the blood that help the blood clot and are smaller than red or white blood cells. Corticosteroids are man-made drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by your adrenal glands. These drugs work by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system. The effects of corticosteroids on dengue infection are still undergoing medical trials and are as yet inconclusive."

      "Black does have a slimming effect, and having a little black in your wardrobe is certainly advisable. Too much makes you look bland and bleak, however. Adding color into your wardrobe gives your clothing personality and makes you look cuter. Wear dresses that have a dark side panel; this will give the body an elongated look. Light pastel shades may make your body look larger, so be careful about choosing them. Bold, bright hues, on the other hand, do not have this widening effect and often look flattering. Solid blocks of color tend to work best. Huge patterns that cover your entire outfit often appear overwhelming. As a result, your curves get masked, and you may end up looking heavier. Stick with smaller patterns or patterns that are limited to one area of your body. Stay away from tops that have ruffles down the front or pants that have decorative zippers on the thigh. These details automatically draw the eye, making the parts of your body they cover noticeably in a very unflattering way. Look for unadorned pieces or those that have embellishments on other parts of your body, such as blouses with beading at the neckline or skirts with lace at the bottom hem. Dark wash jeans look slimming and clean-cut without looking bland and boring. Light wash jeans may make your legs look wider, but many medium washes also work well. A fitted denim jacket with a short waist can add spirit and liveliness to your wardrobe. Stick with medium to dark wash denims, however, since anything lighter will probably make you look heavier than you are. You can get help from someone who is familiar with matching color to skin tones or use online resources to help you. If the tones match, you will look healthy and beautiful. Be aware that what may have suited you 10 years may cause you to look washed out now, as your skin ages. Always update.",
      "Many heavy set women settle for shapeless plus sized clothing because they feel a need to hide their heaviness. Oversized, baggy pieces only make you look larger, however. Like any other woman, you should dress in a way that works with the natural contours of your shape and accentuates your curves. Fitted tops and dresses that nip in at the waist are especially flattering since they define your waist, making your top and bottom look more proportioned. Clothes that are too tight will show any rolls of fat or excess weight you likely want to hide. Clothes that are too big will make you look boxy and larger than necessary. Purchase clothing that brushes against your body without squeezing it, and remember that bunching or pulling will only draw unflattering attention to those areas of your body. Long, fitted pieces that extend past your hip create a smooth, streamlined silhouette that may make your hips and stomach look thinner. Avoid pieces that end at the widest part of your thighs, though, since the horizontal hemline across that area of your body may make your thighs look larger. Long tops may only make you look shorter and stouter. Tops and jackets that stop just above your hipbone elongate your leg, reducing the appearance of stoutness. Tapered legs only make your hips and thighs look larger. A straight-legged pant streamlines your appearance, reducing the appearance of thickness around your thighs. Pants with a slight flare, like boot-cuts, also help by balancing out the width of your upper leg with extra material at the bottom. A-line skirts flare out toward the bottom, creating a flattering silhouette for your hips. Wrap dresses and empire waist dresses are also very flattering since they define your waist and drape naturally off your curves. Not all heavy set bodies are the same. You may have be an apple shape who carries her weight around her stomach, a pear shape who carries her weight around her thighs, an inverted triangle who carries her weight in her chest, or a rectangle whose weight is evenly distributed throughout her body. Determine your body type and learn about what styles of dress flatter your shape best. Stiff fabrics often create a boxy look that adds pounds rather than taking them away. Clingy fabrics tightly form to your body, often accentuating excess weight. Draping fabrics fall off your body naturally, lightly hugging your contours without drawing extra attention to them.",
      "Body shapers are worn under your clothes and help you keep your proportions in check. A good shaper should not be so tight that it leaves marks, but it will keep a little excess fat in check and give you an overall smoother, streamlined look. Many heavy set women are gifted with enviable busts, but this makes it even more important for you to have a supportive bra that fits you correctly. A bra that does not fit correctly may make you look saggy, but a proper fit will help you achieve a very womanly, mature look. Nightgowns that drape over your curves will usually look very flattering. Long gowns work well for most woman, but shorter women should also consider shorter versions of this style. Look for a gown with a deep v-neck to flatter your bust as much as possible.",
      "This tip is especially helpful for shorter women. Heels extend your leg, making it look longer and more slender. A longer looking leg reduces the appearance of stoutness, which may help your overall appearance look more slender. Think large bangle bracelets, chunky beaded chokers, heavy pendants with large charms, and bold rings. Look for cute designs that appeal to your personal taste. Due to your larger appearance, you can wear bolder pieces with style, and without having your figure overwhelmed by them. Necklaces and earrings work especially well in terms of jewelry, but you can also consider scarves, hats, headbands, and other accessories that draw the eye away from your body and toward your face. Get as creative, wild, or elegant as you please. Accessories can definitely make an outfit look cuter, but too much will create a busy look that will end up having the opposite effect. For many heavier set women, shorter hair can make the hips look wider and unbalanced. Balance out bottom heaviness by creating volume on top with long hair. Try incorporating layers and waves into your hair for even more volume. Outline your eyes with eyeliner and mascara, and play with eye shadow color until you find something that looks bold without looking clownish. Noticeable eyes downplay a plumper chin. Stick with skin tone foundations and bronzers. Do not apply too much blush to your cheeks, and do not apply dark colors to your lips. Keep the focus on your eyes by keeping the rest of your make-up subdued. Choose a cute design in a bright color or pattern to give your look a playful edge. Look for girlish embellishments like bows or frills."

      "Before stopping any medication, always talk to your doctor first. Your doctor can help you with any side effects that might result from stopping. They may even prescribe you a different medication.   If you have gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) or Barrett’s Esophagus, your doctor may determine that you need to remain on a PPI like Nexium.  Most of the time, you will not need to rush stop getting off Nexium. Instead, you and your doctor will work out a plan to get you on progressively lower doses. This increases your chance of success. In most cases, you should not stop a medication before you have finished a full course. If you have unpleasant side effects, however, your doctor should know. Common side effects of Nexium include:  Stomach pain Diarrhea Headache Nausea Dizziness Dry mouth Lower your Nexium dose for 2-4 weeks. If you were taking one pill a day, take one pill every other day. If you were taking two pills a day, take one pill a day for 1-2 weeks, and then take one pill every other day for another 1-2 weeks. If you find you are still struggling with severe symptoms, you can taper off even more gradually. Instead of 2-4 weeks, plan for 8-12 weeks. Use a diary, calendar, or planning app to help you remember when to take your next dose. In some cases, conditions like GERD can be fixed through surgery. These are invasive surgeries that will require long recoveries, but they may be able to prevent the need for you to take PPIs in the future. Before you make this decision, have a long talk with your doctor about the risks and recovery times associated with surgery. You may need to stay in the hospital up to a week for this surgery. Bleeding and scarring may occur as well.",
      "Even if you have never had acid reflux before, stopping PPIs like Nexium can sometimes cause symptoms to start. To give you relief, take an over-the-counter antacid, such as Tums or Rolaids. Always consult your doctor about whether it is ok to take over-the-counter medications or not. Smoking can increase acid reflux while affecting how well your esophageal  sphincter works. Talk to your doctor about ways to quit smoking. You may want to avoid secondhand smoke as well. Maintaining a healthy weight is an important tool in reducing the frequency of heartburn. If you are overweight, talk to your doctor or a registered dietician about losing weight. Eating smaller meals will help you lose weight, and it can also help prevent heartburn. Reduce your food portions. If you feel full, stop eating. Eating heavy meals before going to bed can exacerbate acid reflux. Avoid eating large meals 2-3 hours before you go to bed whenever possible. Tight clothes can put extra pressure on your stomach. This can cause or worsen heartburn symptoms. Wear loose clothing whenever possible to help mitigate this.",
      "While the effectiveness of apple cider vinegar on acid reflux has not been studied, many people report improvement after taking it. Take one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar mixed with a teaspoon of honey after every meal. Lowering stress and anxiety may help reduce the symptoms of GERD. Try therapies such as daily meditation or breathing exercises to help you relax and manage your daily stress levels. Iberogast is a liquid supplement containing nine different herbs. It may help reduce acid and treat dyspepsia by preventing intestinal spasms and toning smooth muscles within the digestive tract. Check with your doctor to make sure it won’t interfere with your medications. Iberogast contains angelica, caraway, mustard plant, chamomile, celandine, lemon balm, licorice, milk thistle, and peppermint."

There might be a label on the housing that lists the model number, or it might be stamped right into the metal or plastic of the housing. You can buy well water filters at most home improvement stores, or you can order them through online retailers. You can also check the website for the brand you have; they sometimes sell their filters directly. You can expect to spend between 25 and 35 dollars for your replacement filter, depending on the brand and model. A filter wrench is designed specifically to make removing old filters easy. Metal filter wrenches have a handle, usually coated in plastic or rubber, on one end. On the other, you'll see a large circle made of metal. It will slide over your filter. You can purchase a metal filter wrench from most online retailers.",
      "Well water filers just sit inside of the housing, so there aren't any clamps to unhook. Grasp the top of the filter and pull it straight up to remove it from the housing. Dump any excess water out of the housing after you've removed the filter. Check the ends of the new filter. If it needs to go in a certain way, one end of the filter will say \"top\" and the other end will say \"bottom.\" Make sure the end with \"bottom\" written on it goes into the housing first. On the top of the housing, you'll see the o-ring, or the round piece of rubber that guarantees a tight seal between the housing and system. Take the o-ring off of the housing and check it for dings, flat-spots, or holes. If you find any, you'll need to order a new o-ring. You should be able to get a new o-ring from the same place you purchased your new filter. Use a food-grade silicon grease to lubricate your o-ring and the o-ring groove in the housing. Squeeze some of the lubricant onto the o-ring and rub it all the way around. Replace the o-ring and then squeeze a bit more lubricant into the o-ring groove in the housing. Rub some silicon around the threads on the housing, too. You can find food-grade silicon grease at most home improvement stores or online. The top of the housing will have threads at the top, where it will screw into the filtration system. Line the housing up under where it screws into the system. Once you have the housing lined up, begin rotating the housing counterclockwise. As you do so, it will screw into the system until all of the threads on the housing have disappeared and it won't spin anymore. Then use the filter wrench to tighten it some more. Chances are the outside of the housing got a little wet while you were changing the filters. Use a soft cloth to wipe down the outside of the housing and remove any excess moisture. Once the filter is changed and the housing is screwed back in, you can turn the water back on. Watch the housing carefully — if water starts to leak out of it, you haven't tightened the housing enough. Turn the water off, tighten the housing, and then turn it back on.",
      "When you remove the filter casing, chances are some water will pour out. Place a bucket directly under your filter to catch this water and prevent anything else from getting wet. Your water filter will likely be located near the electrical unit that controls your filtration system. Cover that unit — and any other nearby electrical panels or outlets — with plastic. Use a plastic grocery bag or plastic sheeting to cover any exposed electrical panels. Just make sure there aren't any gaps where water can get in. The exact location of the water shut-off valve will be different depending on the type of system you have and how your home's plumbing is set up. Look for it near the filter. The shut-off valves might look like knobs that need to be turned either vertically or horizontally, or wheels that need to be spun to the right or left. If you're not exactly sure where the shut-off valve is, look up the user or owner manual online. If you're still not sure, you can ask a representative of the company to come out and take a look. At the top of your filter housing, you should see a small red button. This is the pressure release. In order to change the filter, press the button. When you do, a bit of water may come out. That's normal, and the bucket under your filter should catch anything that drips down. Face the handle of the wrench out to the right, away from the housing. Slide the hoop of the wrench up over the housing until it feels snug. Grasp the handle of the wrench and turn it clockwise. It might be hard to turn at first. Apply steady, even pressure on the wrench handle until the housing begins to turn. Depending on where your filter is, there might not be enough room behind it to just continuously rotate the wrench until the filter housing comes loose. If that's true, turn the wrench as far as you can, then slide the wrench off the housing, reset it so the handle is on the right side of the housing, and turn it again. After you've rotated the filter wrench a few times, test the housing's looseness. It should be loose enough for you to unscrew it the rest of the way by hand. Once you get to this point, hold the bucket up as close to the housing as possible. Then unscrew the housing the rest of the way with your hand. Because the housing will be filled with water, it might be heavier than you expect when it finally comes free of the filtration system. Hold the bucket as close to the housing as possible, so that if you accidentally drop the housing, you won't get water everywhere."

Consider baking treats like muffins, cakes, or breads. Try out a new recipe that you can serve your family for dinner one night. or music video for an afternoon project. You can direct, shoot, and edit the movie all by yourself, or you can get your friends and/or family members involved in the process.

Create a simple music video by setting up a camera and dancing to a song with your friends. to give it a new look. You can paint your walls a new color (after making sure it’s okay with your parents), go shopping for new blankets or decorations, or even just rearrange your furniture to make the room look different. Get creative and organize your room so that it reflects your personality.  Look through magazines or online at decorated teen bedrooms for inspiration. If you’d like to buy things for your room but are on a tight budget, visit thrift stores to find unique, less expensive items. If you have paints, markers, crayons, construction paper, or any other sort of craft supplies, gather them together and see what you can create. You can use paints to decorate boxes, notebooks, or even clothing, or use beads to create jewelry.  Decorate a shoe box with construction paper and markers to create a time capsule, or bedazzle a backpack or pair of shoes for school. Cut up different fabrics and tie them onto a string to create a hanging decoration for your room. to make some extra money. If you have a bunch of things you don’t need anymore and want to get rid of them, put prices on your items and have a yard sale. Ask other members of your family if they have anything they’d like to sell, too, and advertise the sale ahead of time so people know about it.  Post flyers in your neighborhood telling the date, time, and location of your yard sale. Make sure your items are reasonably priced so that they sell. You can invite one friend over, or you can make it a group activity and invite over a few (after checking with your parents). Order pizza, watch movies, play games, or just spend the night talking to one another. Tell your friends ahead of time whether or not they need to bring anything, such as a sleeping bag and pillow. If it’s a lazy day and you just feel like relaxing, curl up in a comfy chair and spend your time reading a book. It can be one on your summer reading list, one you’ve wanted to read for a long time, or even an old favorite. You can also download books on your Kindle or phone to read easily and instantly.",
      "Do some research online to find a museum in your area that interests you, whether it’s an art museum, science museum, or history museum. You can make it a solo trip and go explore the museum by yourself, or invite a friend or two to come along. Check to see if the museum has special days where admission is free. Check to see if there’s a movie in theaters that you and your friends would like to go see. You can all share a popcorn and candy, or eat a snack beforehand and enjoy the movie. This is a good activity to do on a super hot or rainy day. If you’d like to spend some time reading but don’t have any new books, head to your local library and peruse their selection. You can check out a fun summer book to read, or you can look for a book about a topic that you’d like to learn more about.  You can also check out movies, CDs, and books on tape from the library. If you don't already have a library card, ask your librarian to help you through the process of getting one. When it’s a hot day out, enjoying ice cream or frozen yogurt is a good way to cool down. Ask a friend to meet you at the nearest ice cream shop, or invite your family to come with you. Plan to see one of your favorite singers in advance, or see if there's a free concert going on in your area. Summer is a popular season for concerts, so you should have lots to choose from once you start looking. Go online to find out when artists are coming to your area. Ask a group of friends or your family members to visit a bowling alley with you or a laser tag arena to play against one another. This works especially well with large groups. You can grab a bite to eat before or after the game with your friends or family.",
      "Summer is the best time of the year to take advantage of the warm weather and open pools. Spend the day at your neighborhood pool, or check out a nearby swimming hole or lake. If you’re swimming in a lake or similar natural area, make sure it’s safe and that you’re allowed to go swimming there.  If you don’t have a community pool to go to, see if a friend has a pool that they’d invite you to. Make sure you apply sunscreen to avoid getting burnt, especially if you plan on spending several hours in the sun. This is a good opportunity to explore your area and enjoy a little bit of nature. If it’s a hot day, consider inviting friends or family members to take an early morning or evening hike with you to avoid the hottest part of the day. Even just a walk around your neighborhood can get you feeling more energized. If you have a bike, take it out for a ride with friends or family members. You can take a leisurely ride around a shaded park, or you can go on a trek across town to get in some exercise. Maybe you’ve always wanted to try out a sport like rugby, ultimate frisbee, or kickball, but you’ve just never had the time. Start practicing your skills by yourself, or get a group of friends together and play the game to help you learn the sport. Check with your community to see if there’s a class or camp you can take that will help you learn the sport, such as a soccer, basketball, or bowling program. There are lots of plants that thrive in the summer, such as berries, peaches, corn, and green beans. Pick out a plant that you’d like to grow and either plant some seeds or purchase a baby plant so that you can watch it grow throughout the summer. You can plant the seeds or plant in your own yard, or you can grow them indoors from a pot, depending on the type of food you’re hoping to grow. family. Invite a bunch of friends to go camping or ask your family if they’d like to go. You can camp out in the woods, in a park, on a beach, or even in your own backyard. Bring a tent and enough sleeping bags for everyone, and prepare food to eat while you’re out in nature.  If you’re camping in a public place, check to make sure you don’t need permission before staying there. Check the weather beforehand to make sure it’s not going to rain. You can bring s’mores to roast on a fire, a frisbee to toss with friends, or cards to play in your tent. Invite your friends or family to go on a picnic with you to a nature preserve, park, or even your own backyard. You can have everyone bring their own dish to share, and make sure you bring a blanket to sit on. If it’s a hot day outside, find a shaded picnic spot under a tree and bring lots of water or other drinks to share.",
      "There are lots of summer jobs you can try to get, even if you don’t have a lot of work experience. Consider babysitting, lifeguarding, dog walking, or mowing lawns to make a little extra money over the summer.  If you live walking distance from small shops or restaurants, ask them if they’re hiring over the summer. You can also try to get an internship if you want to get more experience related to a specific career. Maybe you’ve wanted to learn a new language or construct something out of wood. Think about a skill that would be useful to learn and go online or to your local library to find information about it.  If you don’t have your driver’s license yet, study the driver’s manual so that you’re ready to pass the test. Other skills that you might want to learn include setting up a campsite, cooking new recipes, or sewing. Summer is a great time to start the college application process since you’ll be super busy during the school year. Study for the SATs, work on college essays, or ask your parents to accompany you on some college visits so that you feel more prepared for the process. Consider joining your friends if they’re going on a college visit, or invite a friend to come with you on yours. in your community to help others in need. Not only is it rewarding to help out others, but spending a part of your summer volunteering looks great on college applications. Consider volunteering at places like local animal shelters, retirement homes, or soup kitchens. Other options might include cleaning up a local park or working in a community garden. If you didn’t do well in math or english this past year, the summer is a good time to work on topics that you don’t understand. You can look up the information online, check out a book at the library, or ask a friend to help you with the material you don’t know well. Create a list of topics that you should review so that you know where to focus your time. If you have a passion or interest like dance, rock climbing, or coding, go online or ask around your community to see if there’s a summer course you could take on the subject. There are often a lot of summer courses or camps to choose from, whether it’s academic, artistic, outdoorsy, athletic, or travel-related."

      "When life is bleak, we're not going to laugh no matter what. To see the humorous side of things, we have to be willing. So work on helping him be happy (making someone happy is impossible -- they have to want it) by being your awesome self and gracing his presence with it. By being positive and fun, you're really doing all you can. Be his friend (or whatever is fitting for your relationship), do little things for him, and just try to make his life easier (especially if he's been dealt a sour deck of cards). Let him see the bright side of life so the humor can start flowing. There are few things funnier (and mood-uplifting) than a person that can embarrass themselves and just roll with it. There are few things worse than a person that embarrasses themselves and gets all self-conscious and shameful. So when you spill that soda on yourself, just say that you're saving it for later and that brown looks better on you than white, anyway. Also, it's like two-for-one perfume. You're just being frugal! Studies actually show that embarrassing yourself can actually get people to like you and trust you more. It sort of makes sense -- when you show you're down-to-earth, light-hearted, and just a plain human like they are, it takes away any possible intimidation and stress. Slapstick, physical comedy is the only kind of comedy that's been around for all of human history -- and it still is for a reason. If the witty asides don't come to you naturally, don't stress! You can convince him you're the funniest thing since Tina Fey by just using your non-verbal hilarity.  Popcorn? Uh, yes, please! It's time for a who's-got-better-aim contest. And spaghetti? It's totally Lady & the Tramp time. Standing in line for your favorite movie? Bored so incredibly that you're practically gnawing off your arm for something to do? Why would you not bust out the macarena? As long as he's the type that doesn't embarrass easily, that is.  Try play-fighting, tickling or play-attacking him. The bond of human touch is strong as steel. Is it time for a thumb war rematch yet? Laugh yourself.  You don't need a good reason! Laughing is a chain reaction that often causes other people to laugh. And it will make you happier, too! . If you're visibly high strung or stressed, no situation you're in will be happy-go-lucky and funny. You know that one person that's always a negative Nancy? Don't be the party pooper! Relax. It's the only way to be yourself, be silly, and create an environment where the laughter will naturally flow. If you're relaxed and enjoy each other's company, the laughter will spontaneously start itself! If he's not laughing at your jokes, it's fine. You think you're funny and that's all that matters. If he sees you in your element, being natural, there's nothing to not like. So take a breath -- you got this.",
      "Some girls aren't great at slaying a crowd with one-liners and well-timed anecdotes. To play up your humor, the simplest, most effective way is to just be silly. It shows you're happy, fun, and that you don't take life too seriously. Here are some ideas:  Go for physical humor. Make funny faces, pretend you're stuck in slow-motion, hop on him for a piggyback ride (if that's cool, of course), or start a well-meaning food fight. Put on a show. Do a foreign accent or pretend you're him -- lightly mocking him as a form of flirting, of course. React to him in silly ways. Are you snuggled up against him? Start purring like a cat! When he says, \"Oops, sorry, I drank your last soda,\" you respond with, \"THAT'S IT. I'M MOVING TO CANADA.\" And then you smile and launch into how excited you are to play hockey and watch the beavers. . There is nothing better than someone who is truly genuine and comfortable with themselves. If you can be you, you're showing him that he can be him with nothing to worry about. The humor will come naturally when you're both happy and relaxed!  Don't worry about being funny enough for him! If you're light-hearted and enjoy having fun, he'll enjoy having fun with you. Don't worry about the impression you're making. Do what makes you happy and he'll probably want to join in. If you're trying to be funny, it'll come across that you're trying to be funny. Be natural and let the conversation flow naturally. The humor will come! . Sure, once in a while you get the person who can pull off being absolutely hilarious because they're so dry, cynical, sarcastic, and a little dark and twisty, but generally you want to be around those people in small doses. We live often crave being around people who are bright and cheery because it's contagious. They make us bright and cheery (and bright and cheery often means funnier), bringing out a side of us we feel confident about. He can't not love it. When we're optimistic, everything is a bit brighter. When everything is a bit brighter, it's easier to crack jokes (and to crack a smile in return). It's easier to take a mundane situation and turn it into an opportunity to have fun. The more fun you have, the more you (and him!) will be laughing.",
      "Humor is subjective. What you find funny won't necessarily be the same thing even your best friend finds funny. So in order to know what tickles his funny bone, get to know him! What TV shows does he like? What comedians? What kind of humor does he use to amuse others? All of these are cues as to what gets him giggling. The most aptly-timed joke on, say, Foucault won't be appreciated by the type of guy who prefers laughing at toilet humor. And it works the other way around, too. Does the guy you're eyeing prefer bro banter? Is he into witty non-sequiturs about current events? Can he be slayed by a play on words in Klingon? Find out! On the whole, women value a sense of humor more than men do. What do men want? Someone who will make them feel funny. Instead of trying to impress him, show him that he impresses you. Showing him that he has the right to laugh at his own jokes, too, because he's just so darn awesome could win him over in no time. You don't have to laugh at every joke he makes like your world has just been altered. If he drops a dud, laugh at him, albeit playfully. Did he just try an unfunny, stereotypical, sexist, blonde joke? Oh, honey. Let him know how cute he is for trying with a fake chuckle and a forced grin. When we click with people, chemistry is pretty Unable to ignore. To show him that you just get him and that you appreciate his humor, feed off of it! Did he just whip out his Sean Connery impression on a dime? Keep it going with your best Alex Trebek or Pussy Galore (doesn't have to be good -- this moment is about him). If not an impression, can you drop a line from a movie or challenge him to up his game to Christopher Walken? Establishing a banter can develop a rapport between you two, creating a bond that won't easily be broken. Whether his humor is self-deprecating or straight out of Family Guy, go with it. Show him that you appreciate how fun he is."

      "When a baby starts crawling, it means that her neck, arms, and legs are getting stronger. She is now preparing for the next stage of her development, which is walking. Avoid rushing your child into learning to walk, and know that she will walk when she is ready.The best thing that you can do is to provide her with a safe environment to explore and to give her hours of crawling time. She will be wobbly at first (and might even plop down) but will master it soon enough. When she’s already a good crawler, pretend to chase her and let her crawl after you too. Other ideas include:  Set up a tunnel with a tent or a large box and let her crawl through it. Roll a ball in front of her and make her chase after it. When your baby is seated, give her simple directions such as “give me your block”; this will make her turn her body while looking for the toy.  Withhold a toy when you are playing a passing game; this will make her lean towards you and strengthen her torso. Surround her with several toys to encourage her to explore and move, especially towards those that are a bit far from her. Let your baby stand up while you support her under her arms and let her bounce up and down. This will strengthen her leg muscles.",
      "After months of crawling about, your baby will finally be ready to attempt her first steps. Don’t focus on getting her to walk right away, though. Help your baby practice her balance and coordination. Then, when her leg muscles are up to the task of walking, she will be equipped to take confident steps. Resist putting your baby in a stroller or a sling; let her walk everywhere.  Let her cruise barefoot on the furniture; this will encourage her to walk on her own and is definitely more helpful than any kind of walker out there. Instead of getting a walker with a seat, get a stable push toy that will act as her stabilizer. Give your baby some small balls or clean socks to shoot into a laundry basket; the act of bending down, picking up something, and standing up again is great for balance practice.  Play freeze dance to practice her inhibitory control or her ability to stop her body from moving. Get a big soft ball and let her practice kicking it to each other, or sit on the floor and roll or throw a ball to each other.",
      "From being unable to lift up her head to being able to sit unsupported, your infant’s body undergoes tremendous changes during the first six months. This is an exciting time, and you should encourage your baby to move around as much as possible.  Give her a lot of opportunities to move. Engage her in fun games that will prod her to use her neck, chest, arms, and legs. Use some of the ideas outlined in the steps below. Free your baby from swaddling cloths; let her kick and wave about when she’s awake to strengthen her leg and arm muscles. Put her under a mobile and let her kick and swat at the toys; the point is that she moves her body and not that she accurately hits any of the toys. When she is able turn on her tummy on her own, give your baby daily tummy time; this will strengthen her chest, neck, and arms in preparation for crawling.  Softly ring a bell one side at a time to make her look for and turn to the sound; you can do this when she is on her tummy or on her back. Put a toy just a little bit out of her reach; say “come and get it” and wait for her to try wiggling or rolling towards it. Gently stretch her arms over her head and bend her knees towards her tummy for exercise."

    ],
    "document": [
      "Many pasties come with their own adhesive, while some attach by suction or require a separate adhesive. Look at the packaging of your pasties or any instructions included to see how they should be applied. If your pasties are made of a relatively thin material and are not decorated with heavy elements like sequins, beads or tassels, you can attach them with double-sided tape. Make sure to buy the kind that is meant for fabric, not for paper, as it will be stronger.  Cut small strips of the tape to fit around the edges of the inside of your pasties. Apply the tape to the pasties first, then press them into place. If you want extra security and aren’t worried about the tape being visible, you can add another long strip of tape across each pastie after they are in place. Fabric tape or clothing tape is available in many beauty supply stores and lingerie shops. Fancier pasties, like those used in burlesque costumes, tend to be a little heavier and therefore may require a stronger adhesive. If you are using particularly heavy or large pasties, look online or find a professional costuming shop that sells high-quality body glue or spirit gum. Using a cotton swab or makeup applicator brush, apply the adhesive to the edges of the inside of the pasties, then press them into place. Some adhesives may instruct you to wait a few moments after applying the adhesive to allow it to become sticky. Whether you are using stick-on pasties or applying an adhesive, they will stay on better if your skin is clean and clear of any oils, lotions or moisturizers. For this reason, it’s a good idea to apply pasties after taking a shower and drying off. Some types of adhesive, particularly spirit gum, can cause reactions on sensitive skin. Put a small amount of adhesive on the inside of your wrist and wait a few hours. If there is no reaction, it should be safe to use for attaching your pasties. If you are using tape or adhesive to secure the pasties, keep it on the outer edges rather than the center of the pasties. This will keep it from sticking to more sensitive skin and make removal easier. Many types of adhesive take a few seconds to bond to both surfaces. For extra security, make sure your pasties are placed where you want them and then hold them on tightly for a few seconds to make sure they stick. Even mild adhesives often cause skin reactions if left on too long. To keep your skin healthy, wash any remaining adhesive off with soap and water after you remove your pasties. Some adhesives may require additional cleaning, such as spirit gum, which must be removed with an acetone cleaner.",
      "If your clothes are particularly loose or sheer and you don’t plan on wearing a bra, choosing nude-colored pasties will be the least conspicuous. If your clothes are slightly see-through or slip out of place, it will be less obvious. These will be thicker and less visible through light fabrics. Paper or fabric pasties often create more visible outlines through thin fabrics than silicone pasties. These are usually available in lingerie shops and large department stores. If you are not worried about the shape of your pasties being visible through your clothing, disposable or fabric pasties are typically cheaper and stay on better than reusable silicone ones. These can often be found in beauty supply shops and clothing stores. If you are buying pasties with sequins or tassels for a costume, be aware that the heavier they are, the stronger the adhesive you use will have to be. If you are buying costume pasties, choose the lightest design you can find. Even if your pasties seem to fit well and stay in place easily, it’s a good idea to wait a few hours and see if the adhesive lasts before wearing them out. If you can move around comfortably after an hour or two without feeling like your pasties have shifted or might be falling off, you can most likely be confident that they’ll stay put when you go out. If your pasties are not staying in place, you may need to try either a different shape of pasties or a different type of adhesive."

      "It is important to know what to look for to keep your elderly loved one safe. Some warning signs that they might need professional help include:   Changes in their body language. For example, the person may change their posture, their gestures, the physical distance between themselves and people they are talking with, their facial expressions, or tone of voice. Watch for any significant changes in the person’s body language.  Environmental factors. Consider whether they are different in one environment or around certain people. Does removing them from the environment help? Does incorporating soothing scents, sounds, or colors help?  Not getting basic needs met. Consider whether their basic needs are being met. Are they cold, hot, hungry, thirsty, or in pain?  Changes in communication/behavior after a medical diagnosis. If this person has dementia or Alzheimer’s, consider whether they were able to express certain things to you before, but they are not able to do so now. How did they behave before? What was their behavioral baseline before you noticed this change? Did anything help them or make matters worse? If your relative’s behavior becomes increasingly out of control, you may start to feel uncomfortable or unsafe. If words or behaviors become abusive or dangerous, seek outside help from a therapist or other behavioral specialist. You may need to consider ways to feel safer or talk about ways to calm your relative’s anger. A home health nurse can help, as elderly people tend to be harsher with family and not strangers. A therapist can work with you and your family to help find strategies to cope more effectively. Your relative’s words may embarrass you or really hurt you. It’s hard not to take things personally, but keep in mind it is likely not their intention to hurt you or embarrass you. Focus on positive things and less on the negatives. If you do become upset, excuse yourself and spend some time removed from the situation. Especially if the behavior is new and out of character for your relative, do your best to say to yourself, “These words are hurtful, but do not reflect how my relative feels about me.” If your relative’s words or behaviors make you upset or uncomfortable, consider talking to them about it. Let them know that their words are inappropriate or unkind. Say, “When you speak to me like that, it hurts my feelings. Please do not insult me or the work I do for you.” If talking gets you nowhere, decrease the activities you do for them. This can send the message of “treat me nicely and with kindness and I will continue to graciously help you.”",
      "If your relative is going on and on about something offensive or inappropriate, move their attention to something else. You may want to change the subject or have them look at something.  Come to them with some photos or change the subject to a topic that interests them. Say something funny or introduce a joke.  Say, “That’s enough, let’s look at photos of the grandchildren.” You can also say, “Oh, I heard a funny joke yesterday. Would you like to hear it?” One way to redirect attention can be through touch. Especially if your relative is shouting, yelling, or screaming, they may be having difficulty expressing how they feel. They may be in pain or feel uncomfortable. Use a light touch to help calm them and help them feel safe.  You may want to offer a small treat to help them feel safe and to enjoy something. This can include toffee or some small candy that your loved one enjoys.  You can even incorporate their sense of smell, such as by placing some essential oils in an oil infuser. Try using a calming scent like lavender or rose oil. Colors and lighting can also be calming as well. Try using soft colors and dim lighting to create a calm atmosphere in the person’s room. Guide them to something they can do unassisted or that they feel independent doing, such as coloring or playing with the dog. The activity should be familiar and recognized by your relative, not a new or complicated activity.  Say, “We’re going on a walk now, would you like to join?” You can also say, “Let’s put the dishes away.” If in private, place a soft object in their hand that they can throw without hurting someone. Often, people will divert their focus onto the object and away from their words. Consider using a small stuffed animal or a soft ball. If in public, talk about something your relative enjoys discussing. Say, “I’d like to bake a dessert when we get home. What should we bake?”",
      "You might be shocked or surprised to hear your relative saying something outrageous or crude. When your relative loses their filter, don’t react in shock, anger, or even ridicule. Gently let your relative know that their behavior is inappropriate and move on. There’s no need to bring up an incident once it has passed and you’ve dealt with it in the moment.  For example, say, “It’s not appropriate to speak of people in that way. We do not talk like this.” In some cases, it may even be appropriate to ignore the comment and not respond at all. However, this may not be a good strategy for someone who is suffering from a cognitive decline. If the situation is uncomfortable, gently guide your relative somewhere else. Speak calmly and directly to your relative as you travel elsewhere. You may also notice certain situations that target their inappropriate behavior and divert their attention prior to them seeing something or someone.  If you know your relative has a tendency to say inappropriate things during certain events or situations (like being in a large crowd or around young children), guide them away ahead of time to prevent the situation from unfolding. For example, if your relative is saying something racist while at the grocery store, direct them to a different aisle or exit the store. If you’re feeling like the stress of dealing with your older relative is getting to be too great, take a quick break to de-escalate.  Take a walk or go outside and get some fresh air. If you’re getting frustrated with your relative or need some time to cool off, remove yourself from the situation temporarily. Excuse yourself from the room and go somewhere else. You may wish to prepare a snack to help you get away and return later. Relatives have a way of saying things when others are nearby. It’s up to you how you handle the situation. You can apologize for their behavior (“I’m so sorry my aunt said that to you”), clue them in, (“Sometimes my grandmother says inappropriate things due to her dementia”), or laugh it off (“All those years of embarrassing my uncle as a kid have come back on me!”). However you choose to handle the situation, think about what your relative would want. For example, if your relative has always valued privacy, they may not appreciate you saying things about their condition to strangers. However, if your relative has often valued humor and lighthearted joking, consider taking the statements in stride when out in public."

      "A chestnut or sorrel horse has a coppery red or deep reddish brown coat color on the body and legs. The mane and tail will be the same color as the body or lighter. Make sure the horse has no black points to classify it as a chestnut or sorrel.  Flaxen chestnuts are a variety of chestnuts with much lighter tails and manes. The tails and manes should be a pale yellow color to classify a chestnut as a flaxen. A light chestnut, or sandy chestnut, is a variety of chestnut horse with a sand-colored body, legs, mane, and tail. The body color of palominos varies from light tan to darker golden shades. Their manes and tails will be pale flaxen or white, and sometimes have some black hairs mixed in. Palominos are differentiated by names like golden palomino, chocolate palomino, or yellow palomino to describe the different shades of their body color. Red dun horses are similar in color to chestnuts. Look for a dorsal stripe running down the middle of their back to distinguish a red dun horse. The coat of a red dun can be varying shades of red or reddish yellow. The mane and tail can be lighter or darker than the body color. Cream or cremello horses have a very light, almost white coat. The mane and tail are also almost or completely white. The skin of the horse is a pale pink color and the eyes are always blue. Perlino is a variation of the cremello color in which little amounts of a coffee or cream color are mixed in to the mane, tale, and lower legs of the horse. Smokey cream or smokey perlino are names used when there are higher concentrations of these colors in the horse.",
      "Bay horses come in various shades of red and reddish brown, but always have a black mane, tail, and lower legs. They sometimes have a mix of darker and lighter colored hairs in their coats.  Standard bay horses have a medium reddish brown shade with an even color all over and no mix of lighter or darker hairs. Some variations of bay horses are blood bay (a very dark blood-red color), mahogany bay (a bay that is so dark it almost looks black), and light bay (a light, yellowish shade of red). Black horses have black points and a dark black coat all over their body. There are no brown, red, or lighter colors on a true black horse.  White markings can appear on a black horse. They usually occur on its head or lower legs. These small markings don't classify the horse as a different color. Some black horses fade in color due to sun exposure over time. They are still considered to be black. Black horses that don’t fade in color over time are called jet black or raven black. Brown horses usually have have brown manes, tails, and lower legs with a dark brown coat. They have lighter brown or tan spots on the muzzle, shoulders, and flanks. Brown is sometimes considered a shade of bay horse instead of a separate color. In this case it is called a dark bay. Buckskin refers to a variety of yellow and golden-colored shades of horses with black points. Their colors range from light tan to golden yellow or orange shades.  Buckskin horses often have a long dorsal stripe running down the length of their back. A standard buckskin is called a yellow buckskin. They have a medium yellow coat color all over. Some examples of buckskin color variations are dusty buckskin (a dark brownish-yellow shade), golden buckskin (a dark golden shade), and silvery buckskin (a shade so light that it almost looks silver). Grullas have smoky gray hairs all over their body with a black mane and tail. Their lower legs are usually black as well. They often have a dorsal stripe, a stripe down the middle of their back, and sometimes a darker head. To consider a horse a grulla, each individual body hair has to be the same smoky gray color. The coat should not be a blend of white hairs and colored hairs."

      "While your friend might usually love a spur of the moment visit, recovering from surgery is a different matter entirely. Not only do hospitals often have specific visiting hours, your friend might need to prepare physically and emotionally for visitors.  Know the hospitals visiting hours and policies. Depending on where in the hospital your friend is staying, there is different protocol for visitation. If your friend is still in the recovery room, for example, only one visitor at a time is permitted, with the nurse's permission and supervision, and there are stricter rules for personal hygiene. Call the hospital ahead of time to ask about visiting hours and any restrictions. Try to reach a family member or spouse to see when would be a good time to visit. This way, you'll have a better idea of how your friend is feeling, what tests have been run, and whether they're up for visitors. Once you know, plan your visit accordingly. Call or text once more before heading out to make sure your presence is still welcome. Plan to stay about 20 or 30 minutes, but use your judgment. If your friend seems tired or disengaged, you should slip out sooner. If they seem happy to see you, and are excited to talk to you, then feel free to stay longer. A lot of things can be bothersome to patients just out of surgery, so make sure you do not do anything to cause your friend discomfort during your visit.  Do not wear perfume, aftershave or strong smelling lotions as people are often sensitive to smells when they're sick or recovering from surgery. In addition, many healthcare facilities are now fragrance-free.   When you enter and leave a friend's room, wash your hands with soap, water, alcohol rubs, or hand sanitizer. Check with the nurses' station before entering the room, as you could be required to use a gown, gloves and/or a mask. People are more susceptible to germs after an operation. If you have any type of illness, such as a a cold or flu, ask the hospital staff beforehand if it's safe for you to visit your friend, as it usually isn't. If you are a smoker, only smoke in designated areas and do not get cigarette fumes anywhere near your friend. Due to the risk of bacteria and germs spreading, you could be banned from the hospital if you bring a non service dog into the hospital. Do not swear as this is usually against hospital rules and can get you thrown out and/or banned if caught. Avoid the patient's bed, as this can spread germs. Do not sit or put your feet on the bed. Do not touch the patient's wounds or any medical equipment they are attached to. Do not use the patient's toilet or bathroom, this can also spread germs and bacteria, and nurses may also report you and have you removed from the hospital. Do not share any property, such as toiletries or tissues, with a patient. People love to receive gifts, especially if they're not feeling well. It's not about the money spent, but just knowing that a person cares. Consider bringing a small gift to your friend for them to enjoy post-surgery.  Many people think to bring flowers, but flowers are not ideal for a hospital stay. They take up a great deal of room, and shelf-space in a hospital room is limited. They also decay quickly, and are hard to transport home. Boredom is a huge issue with hospital patients, so consider an interactive gift. Try novels, magazines, crossword puzzle, sudoku books, or a journal. If your friend has some kind of electronic media, like an iPad or tablet, try iTunes or Amazon gift certificates, so they can select and purchase entertaining media for themselves. If food is allowed, bring the patient their favorite snack, as hospital food can get tiresome. However, keep in mind that even if you mean well, they might not want to eat, as surgery and medications can affect their appetite. Many patients are placed on special diets following surgery, and some patients may not be allowed to eat until normal bowel function returns, such as after a bowel resection surgery. A hospital can be a drab, impersonal space. If your friend is there for a prolonged recovery period, try to make their hospital room feel less alien by creating a homey environment for your friend.  Decorate the room. Hospital rooms are beige or white and this can grow depressing with time. Bring cheerful posters, a small decorative hanging, or colorful blankets and throw pillows. Just check with hospital staff first to make sure you're not violating any hospital policies.  Bring them something familiar. During a traumatic event like a surgery, familiarity can be a comfort. Make a small scrapbook of friends, family members, beloved pets, and other loved ones. Borrow your friend's iPod and create custom playlist of their favorite feel better songs or burn them a mix CD. Buy DVD's of their favorite movies and TV shows, as many hospital rooms have a television set patients can use. Act natural when visiting. Your friend is probably eager to get back to a sense of normal, so share news of mutual friends and discuss what's been happening in the news or on TV. Let your friend feel like they're part of the world even if they are stuck in a hospital room. If possible, and after you make sure your friend is up to it, get a group of friends together to visit your friend.  Group visits can feel like a more natural hang out session than one-on-one communication, as people often congregate in groups. Your friend will also be happy to see how many people care and have taken the time to visit. Check hospital policy to make sure there isn't a cap on the number of people permitted in a room at a time. Making some future plans and promises can give your friend something to look forward to after their hospital stay, and reassurance their needs won't be forgotten once they're released.  Set a date to go see a movie, go out to dinner, get coffee, go shopping, etc., sometime after they will be released from the hospital. Your friend will appreciate having something small to look forward to after their stay is over. Offer any assistance in the transition back home, such as driving your friend back from the hospital and running errands for them during recovery.",
      "Food is one of the biggest issues post-surgery as we all need to eat, and oftentimes cooking and even shopping are difficult in the wake of an operation. Be prepared to help your friend with meals during their recovery.  Offer to get groceries. If you're able to go grocery shopping for your friend, do so. Check in with them if you're planning a shopping trip for yourself and see if there's anything they need. Bring over dishes. If your friend is uncomfortable with someone else doing their shopping, cook for them. Great options for meals are dishes that are re-heatable and keep for long periods. Aim for casseroles, soups, lasagnas, and salads. Be aware of any diet restrictions your friend might have. Oftentimes, certain foods are forbidden after an operation. Ask your friend about any kinds of food the doctor has advised against before preparing them a dish. Also, if your friend had any diet restrictions before the surgery - such as being gluten-free or a vegetarian - make sure you are aware of this. Don't tell them to call you if they need anything.  They will probably not want to bother you. Offer specific help, like, \"I have some free time this afternoon, do you need help with anything?\" Household chores are a burden after surgery and your friend will really appreciate a helping hand.  Do laundry, dishes, dusting, and any other cleaning. Your friend is probably laid up, so don't let them fall behind. If you have an extra hour, donate it to your friend in need. If they have pets, help with that. Clean the cat's litter box, walk the dog, make sure the animals have food or water. All of this will be appreciated. If needed, provide free childcare. Whether your friend is a single parent or has a spouse who's busy with work, chances are they will need help with the kids after surgery. Free childcare is much appreciated. While cooking and cleaning are tangible means to help a friend in need, sometimes recovery gets boring and all a person wants is good conversation and a little entertainment. Spend a weekend night with your friend and keep them engaged in conversation and activity.  Share what's going on in your life, but keep it positive and upbeat.  There's no need to mention that you were just laid off or had a big fight with your spouse. You're there to be a source of positive energy. Watch a movie or television show your friend likes. Ask them beforehand if there's anything in particular they've been itching to watch, and pick up a DVD on the way over or rent from an online outlet. Board games and cards are a great way to break the monotony. If you can get a group of people together, stop by your friends house for a round of poker or a game of Clue. While alcohol is great for many social situations, it's unlikely your friend can drink with their post-surgery medication. Be polite. Do not engage in social drinking when your friend cannot. After a surgery, there will be a number of doctor's appointments in the following weeks. Such appointments can be stressful, and having a support system is a wonderful asset for someone recovering from surgery.  Let your friend know you can drive them to the doctor's office. Oftentimes, medication interferes with the ability to drive and public transportation can be a hassle following surgery. Offering a mode of transportation is invaluable. Entertain your friend in the waiting room. Bring playing cards, books of crossword puzzles, magazines, and books or just make casual, funny conversation while waiting for the doctor. Plan something fun after the visit, even something as simple as stopping for milkshakes or having lunch. Something to look forward to can make trips to the doctor more bearable.",
      "The level of emotional intimacy makes a huge difference when it comes to what you should and should not say to someone after surgery. If you're close, it's easier to ask questions without hesitation and be more open expressing how you feel. If it's a more formal friendship, or just a new one, be natural and warm but do not let the seriousness of a surgery push you to say something that might make you both uncomfortable. Stick to small talk, like \"How are you feeling?\" and \"Do you need any help with anything today?\" There's a good chance your friend is not feeling their best in the wake of an operation. Oftentimes, we feel people need a pep talk or positive reassurance. While this is well-intentioned, it can be frustrating to a friend who simply wants to express their thoughts. Let your friend talk, and accept their feelings with patience and empathy.  Avoid phrases like \"I understand\" or \"I know how you feel.\" It's hard to truly understand a situation you are only experiencing secondhand. Instead, say something like \"I can understand how you would feel that way. Tell me more.\" Do not say things like \"You shouldn't feel that way\" or \"Cheer up.\" Such phrases come off as judgmental if someone is feeling discouraged. Instead, say, \"I'm sorry you feel that way, can you tell me why?\" and other words that let your friend know you're listening. Active listening is when you make a conscious effort to hear what another person is saying and to understand the message being sent. If you're helping a friend after surgery, they are the priority and you need to make this clear. Your friend might need to vent, so try to be a patient and active listener post-surgery.  Pay attention. Give your friend your full attention by looking at them directly, putting aside distracting thoughts, engaging with their body language, and avoiding being distracted by the environment. Show that you're listening. Nod occasionally, smile and use other facial expressions, make sure your posture is open and inviting, and encourage the speaker to continue with verbal comments like \"yes\" and \"I see.\" Provide feedback. Your role is to understand what is being said, so you may need to reflect on what your friend's expressing and ask questions to fully understand. Try things like, \"So, what you're saying is...\" and \"What I'm hearing is...\" Ask questions for clarification, like \"What do you mean when you say...\" and \"Is this what you mean?\" Defer judgment. Do not interrupt your friend. Wait until he or she is done talking before asking questions, and do not be argumentative or question their responses. Respond appropriately. Be candid, open, and honest about your responses and assert your opinions respectfully, without dismissing your friends concerns or issues. While your friend might be interested in hearing about you and your life, only talk about yourself when prompted. Talking to a friend post-surgery is about them and how they are feeling, so make sure you know what questions are appropriate to ask.  Do not ask about their health or test results unless they bring it up. Oftentimes, people recovering from surgery grow tired of medical talk and might not want to go into specifics about their doctor visits. Do ask how they're feeling. A more vague question is appropriate. This gives your friend control. He or she now has the option to open up about their medical issues or to keep things light. Ask them if they need anything. People are often wary to ask favors, so make sure to offer as your friend might need assistance with day-to-day chores. Ask them about family members and other loved ones. Show your friend you care by showing genuine investment in the things and people they care about. The key to being a supportive, loving friend is empathy. Seeking to understand any fears associated with surgery can help you empathize and be a more effective listener.  Control, or rather loss of control, is one of the biggest fears when it comes to surgery and its aftermath. People fear handing their well-being over to someone else, and the loss of control over one's body and movements that comes in the wake of surgery is frustrating. Understand your friend is feeling a lack of control, and remind them this is a normal feeling.  What's at stake when it comes to surgery is a better life. People undergo surgeries to treat prolonged illnesses or injuries, and if improvement is gradual or if the recovery period is prolonged disappointment can set in fast. Remember this when dealing with your friend, and remind them progress takes time.  Going to hospitals and undergoing anesthesia bring up fear of our own mortality. This is perhaps the biggest fear associated with surgery, so be aware your friend might want to discuss dark subjects when you visit them. Be emotionally prepared for this. Most people, even the calmest among us, experience some kind of fear and anxiety when in a hospital setting. Know ways to cope with this anxiety that you can share with your friend.  Self-trust is important. Anxiety is rooted in mistrust. Most often this mistrust is projected onto others, but is often a reflection of mistrust for oneself. Remind your friend to trust their body and trust that they are capable of doing whatever is required for recovery. Taking action can help curb anxiety. Tell your friend to engage in activities that help with anxiety while promoting good physical well-being as well. Eat right, exercise, meditate, spend time outside, spend time with friends and family, engage in hobbies, etc.  Planning is also key to staying calm. If your friend is healing, tell them to focus their energy on healing and not anxiety. Help them make a post-surgery plan to get through the days they'll be laid up. Make lists of all the materials needed - such as groceries, reading materials, and toiletries. Is there any work your friend could catch up on that they're able to do after surgery?If so, help them figure out what it is and make a plan to do it."

      "It may not be appropriate to brush kittens if they are too heavily soiled – wash first, then brush. However, if your kitten isn't very dirty and the fur doesn't seem contaminated, you can easily clean her by brushing.  Brushing is very helpful to remove any fleas from wild rescued kittens. It also helps to stimulate subcutaneous blood circulation, and it may actually improve the condition of your cat's skin. Brushing is especially important for long-haired cats. With long fur, it's much easier to get things stuck, smeared, and generally dirty. The brush or comb will differ from kitten to kitten based on the length and pattern of her coat. Check your kitten for fleas: if she is flea-ridden, you will need a special thin-toothed comb to remove the pests from the skin. You can purchase specially designed metal combs from most pet shops. Consult with your local vet if you are confused about which brush to select. Brushing in the wrong direction can irritate your kitten and cause her to lose hair. Brush her whole body thoroughly, focusing on the abdomen, back, and hindquarters.  Some kittens may resist brushing. Be gentle, and do not force. Use a calm, soothing voice when you're grooming your kitten, and try to make her feel comfortable. Clean your brush periodically during the process. Dirt and hair may clump on the bristles, making the tool less effective. Cats naturally groom themselves, and your kitten may take offense when you try to help her. She also may just be curious. If she begins biting at the brush, simply lay it in front of her so she can smell it, then use the second brush to keep brushing. This gives the kitten a chance to see the brush while she is being groomed. Eventually, she may learn to love brushing, and she may allow you to groom her freely Repeat as needed. Keep switching out the brushes. Whenever she grabs the brush you are using, just pick up the other one and continue to brush.",
      "Again, cats naturally lick themselves clean, so your kitten only needs a full bath if she is especially dirty – or if she has fleas. To clean a heavily soiled kitten, you'll need to her a bath rather than just a simple wipe-down. Bathe your kitten immediately after she gets soiled; if you wait too long, she may be uncomfortable and she may develop a rash. Prepare the supplies before you bathe your kitten:  A clean flannel and towel(s) Cat shampoo; avoid human soaps, and harsh chemicals or cleaners A basin, sink, or any watertight tub. Avoid washing your kitten outdoors — if it tries to escape the bath, you will have much more trouble tracking it down outside. Do not use human shampoo, human soap, or dish soap to wash your kitten! Your kitten's fur and skin are very sensitive, and human soaps will dry out its skin. Once you have chosen a bathing location, you should also prepare a warm and welcoming space for the kitten to wind down after its bath. Choose a room in the house that you can close off with a door, a curtain, or a pet gate.  Prepare a warm, cozy spot beneath a desk lamp (or other light source). Plug in a pet-specific heating pad, if you have one. Your kitten will be cold and wet after its bath, so it will want to find a warm location to clean itself.  Have a treat (or dinner) ready so you can give it to your kitten after its bath. A yummy treat will be a nice reward for your kitten. Use lukewarm water – neither too hot nor too cold. The water should feel comfortable on the skin of your wrist. It is very important to use temperate water. Kitten skin is sensitive: hot water can burn your kitty, while cold water can reduce its body temperature to a dangerous level. Make sure that the water is not deep enough to completely submerge your kitten. . Fill the basin before you introduce your kitten to the water. Many cats aren't actually afraid of water itself, but of the loud noise of running water. Once they are startled by running water, they learn to fear it. Gently stroke your kitten to make her feel safe and calm. Talk to her in a soothing voice throughout the cleaning process.  Introduce her to water slowly at first. Set her down in the water and let her stand in it for a few seconds. Then, pull her out and dry her feet. Give her a treat to reward her good behavior. If your cat is very resistant to bathing, ease her into it over the course of two weeks. Towards the end of the second week, you should be able to wash her without a struggle, even under the tap. Make sure that your kitten is completely wet before you start to lather. Squeeze a small amount of shampoo onto a cloth or your hand, and rub it into her coat. Gently lather the shampoo over the kitten's whole body, from her head down to her tail. Use a wet finger to remove any urine or feces that have dried onto the fur.  Avoid washing kittens with soap unless you are treating for fleas. If this is the case, consult with your veterinarian to find a soap that is safe for your kitten. Keep everything—water, soap, etc.—out of her eyes and off her face. This might irritate her eyes and cause her to panic. If she panics, she'll develop negative associations with bathing. Fill a cup of water and pour it slowly over her body. Pour slowly and carefully, and try to be efficient. Wash away all of the lathered shampoo. Use a damp flannel or washcloth to wipe soap from your kitten's face. Speak to her in a calming voice if she's resisting or seems afraid.  If your kitten is getting feisty at this point, have someone else hold the kitten down while you pour the water over its body. If your sink is outfitted with a detachable spray nozzle, feel free to use this. Make sure that it isn't on a powerful setting, or you might hurt your kitten. Do not run tap water directly onto a young kitten's head. If you do, water might get into her eyes and startle her. Do not submerge your kitten in water deeper that it can comfortably stand in. Your cat may not be strong enough to pull itself out. Instead, use your hand to wet the kitten's hindquarters and lower belly. Bathe your kitten as quickly as possible, then dry her fur with a clean towel. Swaddle the kitten with another soft, dry towel, and put her in a warm place until dry. Stay with her, if possible, and cuddle her to help her calm down. Hasten the drying process by rubbing the soft towel in the direction that your kitten's hair grows. This will get her warmer faster if she seems cold.",
      "Kittens habitually clean themselves with their tongues, but there are some spots that they have trouble reaching – namely, the head, the back, and the behind. Mother cats usually help kittens clean these spots. Your job, as surrogate mother cat, is to clean your kitten regularly to ensure that she is healthy and hygienic. Wiping with a wet cloth also uses less water than a full bath. This makes it a good way to gradually and safely introduce kittens to water and washing. Many kittens, especially young kittens, are very messy eaters. After the kitten has eaten, massage her entire body with a clean, moist cloth. Pay special attention to the abdomen and genital region – this may encourage her to relieve herself. Make sure that the towel is not rough enough to irritate your kitten. If the kitten is particularly dirty, consider dabbing the cloth with a vet-recommended pet shampoo. You can find special kitten shampoos in most pet shops. Use a cloth wet with warm water. Always follow the direction of the fur to avoid hurting or irritating your cat. Hold your kitten and talk to her in a soothing voice to make her comfortable. Many kittens are used to being petted on the back, so restrain your cleaning to that area until the kitten is okay with the cloth. If your kitten gets nervous or scared at any time in the cleaning process, stop washing for a moment and hold her close. Continue to talk in the soothing voice. Your kitten may begin to trust you more once she knows that you will respond to her complaints. Start from the face and forelegs, move to the back and abdomen, and finish with the hindquarters. Avoid the kitten's eyes, ears, and nose! Unless the kitten's head is extremely dirty, it may be best to avoid the head altogether. Don't worry, however: the kitten will likely clean its head on its own after the bath. Kittens have trouble cleaning this area by themselves, and it is where their mother likely helped them the most. This is why cats will often turn around and stick their back ends in your face while you're petting them: it's a sign of trust, like they trusted their mother at a very young age.  Consider cleaning your kitten's behind every few days, especially if she does not clean herself. This will help keep your kitten happier and healthier, and it will keep odors away. If your cat isn't cleaning herself, it can be a sign that she is overweight. If there is still more dirt on her coat, you can repeat the process by using another cloth. When your kitten is completely clean, put her in a warm place to cuddle up while she dries out. Blot the excess water with a dry towel to make sure that your kitten is almost completely dry. If you leave her wet and shivering, she may be at risk of falling ill."

      "Dissolve 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of table salt, sea salt, or Epsom salt in 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water in a clean cup, preferably in a disposable plastic one for each treatment. Soak the piercing or make a compress with a clean washcloth saturated with the salt water. Do this two to three times per day, fifteen minutes per session.  If you don’t see improvement in 2-3 days, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your doctor for help. Be sure to cover the entire piercing with the salt soak, on both sides of the hole. Continue to clean the piercing regularly with warm water and mild antibacterial soap. It’s also okay to dab a small amount of antibiotic ointment onto the wound if infection is present. If you notice slight signs of infection like some redness or swelling that doesn’t go away, it’s okay to call your piercer and ask for advice on how to care for it. You can also go in to see them if you start to have drainage – they’ve seen so many piercings they can probably tell you whether the discharge is normal or not. This only applies if a trained professional pierced you. If not, consult a doctor with any medical questions. Infections in piercings usually stay localized to the area of the piercing. However, if an infection spreads or gets into your bloodstream it can result in a serious, even life-threatening systemic infection. With severe infection you can have a fever, chills, nausea or vomiting, or dizziness.  If you notice that your pain, swelling, and redness near your piercing start to spread to a larger area, see your doctor right away. This might be a sign that the infection is worsening and moving to larger areas of your body. Your doctor will probably prescribe you antibiotics to prevent a severe infection. If the infection is already in your blood, you’ll probably have to stay in the hospital and have IV antibiotics.",
      "properly. Your piercer should give you specific instruction for how to clean your new piercing, including suggesting what products to use for cleaning. Different piercings have somewhat different cleaning requirements, so get clear, written instructions. In general, follow some simple guidelines:  Clean skin piercings with warm water and non-scented antibacterial soap, like Dial, or with warm salt water. Don’t use rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide on the new piercing. These are too harsh and can damage or irritate the skin. Avoid using antibiotic creams or ointments. They trap dirt and debris and do not allow the piercing to breathe. Clean your piercing as often as your piercer recommends – not more or less. Under-cleaning can cause buildup of dirt, crust, and dead skin. Over-cleaning can irritate and dry skin out. Both are detrimental to healing. Gently move or twist the jewelry while cleaning it to get the solution inside the piercing and coat the jewelry. This isn’t true for some types of piercings, so always ask your piercer first. Other than proper cleaning techniques, taking care of your piercing can help prevent unnecessary pain and infection. Some guidelines to follow for general piercing care are:  Don’t sleep on your new piercing. Your jewelry can rub on your blankets, sheets, or pillows, causing irritation and getting the area dirty. Sleep on your back if you got a navel piercing; if your new piercing is facial, try using an airplane support pillow and aligning your piercing with the middle \"hole.” Wash your hands before you touch the piercing or surrounding area.  Do NOT remove the jewelry before you piercing is healed. Doing so will probably let the piercing close up. If the area is infected, the infection will be trapped in your skin. Try not to let clothes rub directly onto new piercings. Also, do not twist your jewelry unless you’re cleaning it.  Stay out of pools, lakes, rivers, hot tubs, and other bodies of water until your piercing heals. About 1 in 5 piercings get infected, usually because of unsterile piercing procedures or improper aftercare. Only ever get pierced by a trained professional and in a reputable, clean piercing studio. Before getting pierced, insist that your piercer show you how and where their equipment is sterilized – they should have an autoclave, and clean all surfaces with bleach and disinfectant.  Piercers should only ever pierce you with a new needle out of a sterile package, NEVER a reused needle, and they should always wear fresh, disposable gloves while piercing.  A piercing gun is NEVER appropriate. Walk out if you see a piercing gun. Go to a professional to ensure a sterile procedure. Check with your state legislation about what licensing and training someone needs to have in order to pierce you. Do NOT pierce yourself or ask an untrained friend to pierce you. Though having an allergic reaction to jewelry is not the same thing as getting an infection, anything that irritates your new piercing also increases the risk for infection. A severe allergy could also force you to remove your new jewelry. Always get pierced with hypoallergenic jewelry for the best chance for good healing. Request stainless steel, titanium, niobium, or 14- or 18-karat gold. There are lots of places you can get pierced, through different types of tissue in areas that get more or less blood-flow. Thus, healing time varies a lot. Know the specifics of your piercing so you know how long you have to take extra care of it (for a specific piercing not listed, consult your professional piercer):  Ear cartilage, nostril, cheek, nipples, navel, and dermals/anchors/surface piercings: 6-12 months Earlobe, eyebrow, septum, lip, labret, beauty mark, and Prince Albert: 6-8 weeks Clitoral hood: 4-6 weeks Tongue: 4 weeks",
      "It’s normal for a fresh piercing to be pink; you just received a puncture wound, after all. However, redness that get worse or spreads to a larger area is a sign of possible infection. Keep an eye on your piercing or take photos of it and make a note about whether your redness is improving or worsening over a day or two. The area around your new piercing will likely swell for about 48 hours as your body adjusts to what it perceives as an injury. After that time, swelling should start to go down. Worsening swelling, swelling that appears after a time of being normal, and swelling accompanied by redness and pain are symptoms of infection. Swelling can cause loss of function, like if your tongue gets swollen and doesn’t move easily. If the area around your piercing is too painful or swollen to move, you could have an infection. Pain is your body’s way of telling you something is wrong. The original pain from your piercing should subside within two days or so, around the same time that swelling starts to decrease. It’s normal for this pain to be stinging, aching, burning, or tender. Pain lasting longer than a couple of days or that gets worse may indicate infection. Of course, if you accidentally irritate your new piercing you’ll probably experience some pain. It’s pain that gets worse or doesn’t go away that you want to watch out for. With redness, swelling, and pain, comes heat. If your piercing is really inflamed or infected it might feel like it’s giving off heat or even feel hot to the touch. If you’re going to touch your piercing area to check for heat, always wash your hands first. It is very normal and healthy for a new piercing to ooze some clear or straw-colored fluid that then might crust around the jewelry. This is lymph fluid, and it is a part of the healing process. On the other hand, thick whitish or colored discharge (yellow, green) is probably pus. Pus might also have an unpleasant odor. Any thick, milky, or colored discharge should be considered a likely sign of infection. See your doctor if your piercing has pus around it. Discomfort you feel the day you get pierced probably isn’t infection; it generally takes a day or more for signs of infection to develop. It’s also unlikely that you will develop an infection in a piercing you have had for a long time and is already healed. However, infection in old piercings is possible if any sort of injury occurs to the area; any cut or opening in the skin can be a doorway for bacteria. If the piercing is in an area of the body more prone to infection, you should suspect infection more quickly. Ask your professional piercer about how likely your piercing is to become infected.   Navel piercings must be cleaned well. Because they’re in a warm, sometimes damp location they have a higher risk of becoming infected. Tongue piercings have higher risk of infection because of bacteria in your mouth. Because of its location tongue infections can lead to serious complications like infection of the brain."

If your poetry uses formal language like “O my dear love” or “Long was I lost on the high seas,” strip it down to make it more simple and casual for your listeners. Pretend you are talking to a friend or family member in your song lyrics. For example, if you have a line in your poem like “Alone I felt in a sea of people,” you may adjust it to, “I felt alone in a sea of people” or “Just me in a sea of people.” Keep any poetic imagery that will give the listener a sense of the speaker’s emotions and feelings. Make sure the imagery uses sensory details, such as what the speaker is seeing, touching, tasting, hearing, and smelling. For example, you may have a line in your poem like, “I feel the ground/by the cemetery.” You may then adjust the line for song lyrics and make it, “The cool, hard ground/I feel it/By the cemetery/Where she died.” A good song will connect with your listeners and make them think, “I’ve felt that before” or “I’m feeling like that right now.” Use details from your poetry that feel universal and relatable for your listeners. For example, maybe you have a detail in your poetry about how it feels for you to lose your best friend. You may then include these details in a song about your relationship about your best friend, discussing the relationship from your perspective. A good song will take the listener on a journey and explore an experience or moment in a detailed way. There does not necessary have to be a clear beginning, middle, and end in a song, like in a book. Instead, the song should explore the thoughts and feelings of the speaker on a specific subject or idea. Pull lines out of your poetry that tell your listener a story from a particular perspective. For example, you may notice that your poetry often explores the recent birth of your brother. You may then pull lines out of your poetry to write a song that tells the story of the joyous day your brother was born.",
      "Songs are structured into verses, similar to stanzas in poetry. Most songs have verses that are eight to twelve lines long. The lines in verses are usually short, no longer than eight to ten words. Break up your poetry into verses so it better reflects the structure of a song.  You may need to add or remove words from each line of your poetry to make them into verses. Be open to changing the lines of your poetry as needed to make them into song lyrics. When you are creating the verses, use lines in your poetry that are easy to follow and understand. You can also rearrange words or lines in your poetry to form a verse. Most song lyrics will include a chorus, which is usually six to eight lines long. The chorus will repeat after each verse in the song. It should contain the central idea or meaning of the song. Take the words in your poetry and create a chorus for the song that is short and uses several words over and over again.  For example, you may take a longer line in your poetry like, “The wind screams by my window and I am alone in my childhood bedroom, trying not to look at the new moon” and break it up to create a chorus: “The wind screams by my window/I am alone/The wind screams by my window/I’m not looking/The wind screams/At the new moon.” The chorus of the song will usually contain the title of the song. You may use the title of your poem as inspiration for the chorus of the song. Not all song lyrics rhyme. In fact, many modern songs have no rhyme scheme at all. Maybe you decide to avoid rhyme because you want the freedom to use whatever words you want. Or perhaps you want your song to rhyme so it is more catchy for your listeners.  If you decide to include rhyme in your song lyrics, you may simplify the rhyme scheme in your poetry so it is more casual and easy to follow. For example, if you have a poem where every second line rhymes, you may adjust it so only the first and third lines rhyme or only the second and fourth lines rhyme. If you are composing rap lyrics, you may decide to stick to a couplet rhyming scheme, where every two lines rhyme in the song. Many songwriters are also known as poets who have written or published poetry. Listen to their songs and read their song lyrics to get a better sense of how they combine poetry with music. You may listen to:  “20th Century Schizoid Man” by King Crimson, which was co-written by poet Peter Sinfield. “Subterranean Homesick Blues” by Bob Dylan, who is considered a poet as well as a songwriter. “Blood on the Leaves” by Nina Simone, which is considered a song with poetic, powerful lyrics. “Big Yellow Taxi” by Joni Mitchell, who is considered a poetic singer-songwriter.",
      "Create an original melody on guitar. Add drums, keyboards, or strings to flesh out the melody. You can also use a melody that has already been made and is available for use online. Find a melody that you find interesting or catchy. You may also choose a melody that fits the mood or subject matter of your poetry. For example, if your poetry is about isolation and sadness, you may pick a melody that is just guitar on its own to create a lonely, isolated sound. Notice if certain lines do not fit or go well with the melody. Underline or highlight lines or words that seem to fit. Get a feel for how your poetry sounds when sung along to the melody.  You may need to try singing a few different poems or lines of poetry to the melody to get a better sense of what works and what doesn’t. You may also need to sing the same lines of poetry several times to the melody to find the right rhythm. Be patient and have fun playing around with your words against the melody. Remove any words or phrases that sound clunky or awkward when sung along to the melody. Add words or phrases that complement or fit with the melody. Repeat words that sound good and seem to match the melody well. You can then start creating verses and a chorus for the song, making use the words match well with the melody you have chosen."

      "If you embossed a design into your armor, simply draw over it with fabric paint from a squirt-tube to create a raised design. You might have to do this more than once to make it more visible. Since the results will be thick, allow this to dry overnight. Since the foam is spongy, you will need to seal it before applying any glue. One suggested mixture is 1 part school glue or Sobo glue, 1 part flexible fabric glue, and 2 parts water. Apply and dry thin coats until sealant no longer forms holes where air bubbles from the foam pop through. This may take as many as 7 or 8 coats, but because the layers are thin, the dry time shouldn’t be unbearable. Don’t allow debris to stick to the glue or it will produce bumps in the armor. If the armor sticks out in places (leaving the underside exposed), painting the back will give it a more professional look. Because the foam will bend and move with your body, ordinary paints will crack. On a piece of scrap foam, experiment with flexible craft paints (ex. fabric paint) to see what will work for your design. Be sure to apply the paint evenly to prevent streaking and work it into and cracks or crevices. This can be done by brushing dark acrylic paint (ex. a mixture of black and green for a tarnished copper look) over your armor and wiping most of it away before it dries so that hints of it remain in the cracks.",
      "Focus on the basic shapes (their size, and connections for adjoining pieces) rather than the color or detail, which can be dealt with later. Decide where and how individual pieces will overlap so that they can be connected and flexible. Simplify the structure where possible to avoid juggling lots of pieces and having to connect them in too many places (which will weaken it). You can also look online for ready-made patterns for armor, some of which you will even be able to print out. Here is a list of some common pieces of armor you will likely want to sketch:  Helmet Breastplate Pauldrons or shoulder pieces Shield Gorget or neck protector. Arm pieces such as rerebrace, vambraces, and gauntlets. Leg pieces such as cuisses, poleyn, and greaves. Measure the head size, height, waist size, arm and leg length, and any other needed measurements for the person that will be wearing the armor. These measurements will help determine the necessary dimensions that you will need to make the helmet, breastplate, shoulder armor, or any other miscellaneous coverings. Though these won’t be your primary means of sizing the armor, they will be useful to reference whenever you’re making a cut, connection, or alteration that you can’t accurately test. The fastest way to do this is to have a friend hold pieces of flexible, sturdy paper (such as poster board) against you and draw each piece of the design individually, creating a rough outline that you could then modify as necessary. A more accurate method would be to make a form (or a mannequin) to build the paper template around. Make sure all the pieces have been accounted for and adjust their sizes or proportions as necessary. Whenever you have matching pieces (e.g.: two shin plates, gauntlets, etc.), choose the nicer version and scrap the other one; that way, you can use the nice one as the pattern for the other to keep your armor symmetrical. When you’re happy with your pieces, clean up and smooth out the lines, label both your original sketch and the corresponding pieces (making note of any that will be duplicated), and cut all the shapes. Trace each piece to the craft foam with a ball-point pen (which will glide smoothly over the material without snagging or tearing). Making duplicates of pieces where necessary. Label the undersides and then cut the shapes out.  To make very large pieces, you may need to patch two pieces of foam together. Preferably, attach the pieces where it is inconspicuous, or can be integrated into the design. For example, creating a seam down the center of a breastplate. You can use a number of other materials to create your costume armor, such as cardboard, Wonderflex or anything else that suits your means. The same steps can be applied to any material. To make your foam go further, trace large pieces first and then fit the smaller ones in around them. Lightly sketch the designs with a ball-point pen or a dull knife and when you’re happy, go over them several times while pressing hard to engrave them into the foam. It’s much easier to draw on the foam while it’s flat and not yet assembled. Just be sure not to tear the materials.",
      "Since it’s flexible, this will simply be a matter of gluing it into curves in many places. In some places, however, you will want to mold the foam into shapes that hold on their own. This is done by holding the foam near a steady, safe heat source (such as a heat gun or stove) to soften it and then manually bending it over another object such as a liter bottle or rolling pin.  You will only have a few seconds to do this, so work quickly. It’s best to test your technique on a few scrap pieces beforehand so that you learn how to heat the foam without causing it to scorch, shrink, or bubble. If you want you can also try using a hair dryer on high heat or an iron to heat the foam. If you don't have a heat source you can try wrapping the armor around a rounded object for a couple days to create the desired curves. You can create arm or leg pieces around a Pringles can and use a rubber band to hold them in place. White school glue is fine for this. In some cases (ex. in places with lots of overlap or dramatic curves), it will make sense to do this after the pieces have already been heat-molded to keep from putting undue strain on the material. However, when you’re dealing with pieces that require minimal molding or don’t overlap in a way that constricts their movement too much, you might want to glue them together before molding them. Flip joined pieces over, paint them with glue, and smooth a gauzy fabric (ex. cotton crinkle gaze or cheesecloth) over them, making sure to work into creases and curves with a pointed edge. After it dries, cut away the excess and apply one more coat of glue. If you are dealing with lots of pieces, you might have to assemble a number of them just to make one section of one part of the armor. Think about where it makes the most sense to join subsections together before connecting them to make larger pieces. Since the foam is flexible, you will have quite a bit of leeway with this: a well-placed seam that you can force your way into and out of would be no problem for craft foam. For traditional-style armor, however, you will want to mimic the way that real armor is assembled by connecting various pieces with leather or fabric straps that you can untie/unbuckle as necessary. Unless you’ve made a full, one-piece suit, you will likely have to attach separate sections differently. Wearing a tight-fitting outfit underneath the armor and attaching Velcro to a number of places as anchor points would work well provided that you line everything up correctly. You might, for example, stick double-sided Velcro to the necessary parts of your under-outfit. Press the armor onto these points in front of a mirror until the look right. Then more firmly attach each Velcro half to its respective part of the ensemble using thread or a strong glue to hold the pieces in place."

      "It is recommended that you avoid traveling while pregnant, as this increases your chances of developing traveler's diarrhea. You should be particularly careful to avoid high-risk areas — these include developing parts of the world like the Middle East, Asia, Africa and South America.  The main cause of a traveler’s diarrhea consuming water or food that is contaminated with bacteria. Pregnant women have a particularly sensitive stomach due to hormonal changes that take place in their bodies, so you have to be very careful about what you ingest. If you have to travel while pregnant, avoid drinking tap water at all costs, and only drink bottles or boiled water. Not only should you avoid drinking the tap water, you should also avoid brushing your teeth with it or making ice cubes from it. If you buy fresh fruit from a local market, make sure to wash it thoroughly with bottled or boiled water and then peel it before eating. Avoid fruits that can't be peeled or that you haven't peeled yourself. Good personal hygiene is essential for avoiding diarrhea. You need to be particularly vigilant about washing your hands, as they can easily pick up bacteria that causes diarrhea.  Wash your hands before and after using the restroom or changing the baby's diaper. Always wash your hands before preparing food, or after handling raw meat.  Wash your hands thoroughly using hot water and anti-bacterial soap, then dry completely using a clean towel. Sometimes diarrhea occurs when expectant mothers start exercising during pregnancy, especially if they didn't exercise before. This occurs as a result of increased intestinal activity.  If possible, try to start an exercise program before you become pregnant and continue with it throughout your pregnancy. In this way, you can avoid \"shocking\" your body with exercise. If it's too late for that, you should do your best to slowly ease yourself into an exercise routine while pregnant. Start out with something easy, like a daily 20 minute walk. Then you can gradually increase the length and intensity of your workouts. One or two bouts of diarrhea in a 24 hour period is fairly normal and not something that you should be concerned about. However, if you have more than three instances of diarrhea in a 24 hour period, or the diarrhea persists for more than a full day, you should consult a doctor.  You should also see your doctor if you experience any of the following:  a combination of vomiting and diarrhea, mucus in diarrhea, diarrhea that is greenish in color, diarrhea that is bloody or black in color, a combination of constipation and diarrhea, or a combination of abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Any of these may be symptoms of a more serious underlying condition. Therefore, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible to prevent any possible complications that could harm you or your unborn baby.",
      "Psyllium is a popular natural remedy for preventing diarrhea, as it increases the absorption of water in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in harder stool and reduced bowel movements.  To use psyllium husks, add half a teaspoon of ground psyllium to an 8oz. glass of water. Stir to combine and drink before the mixture thickens. Do this once in the morning at once at night. As your body adjusts to the psyllium, you can gradually increase the quantity to 2 teaspoons for every 8oz of water. Fenugreek works in a very similar way to psyllium, as it absorbs water from the gastrointestinal tract, making the stool firmer. To use fenugreek, mix half a teaspoon of the fenugreek seeds into an 8oz. glass of water and drink. Do this two or three times per day. Blueberries contain tannins which reduce inflammation and mucus secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. This helps to relieve diarrhea. You can eat fresh or frozen blueberries, or buy dried, powdered blueberries which you can add to smoothies and cereals, or boil in hot water to make tea. Ginger tea and herbal teas like chamomile and peppermint have been used as a natural treatment for diarrhea for many years. They are also calming and soothing and help to keep you hydrated.  Ginger contains two substances called gingerol and shogaol, which help to slow down bowel movements and prevent diarrhea. Ginger also helps to ease the abdominal cramping often associated with diarrhea. To make ginger tea, add some freshly grated ginger to a cup of boiling water and let it steep for 15 minutes before straining and drinking. Add honey to taste. Try to drink 2 to 3 cups per day. Chamomile and peppermint both act as muscle relaxants , producing a calming effect on the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. This limits the number of bowel movements you'll have and will prevent diarrhea. Chamomile and peppermint teas are easily available at the supermarket and in health food stores. Try to drink two to three cups per day during pregnancy. Apply cider vinegar helps to kill the bacteria in the digestive system that causes diarrhea. It also contains pectin, which helps to harden the stool. Place one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in an 8oz. glass of water and drink up to three times a day, before eating.",
      "The BRAT diet is great for pregnant women who are suffering from diarrhea as the foods it contains are low in fiber and easy to digest, but still highly nutritious. The BRAT diet is easy on the gastrointestinal tract and rarely causes diarrhea.  Bananas are high in potassium, which helps to replace the potassium that is lost during diarrhea. Bananas also help to thicken the stool, which prevent diarrhea. Applesauce (made at home using only apples) contains pectin, which helps to thicken stool. It's also high in natural sugars, which provides energy. Rice and toast are simple foods which are easily digested. They also work as binding agents to thicken the stool. Clear soups and broths contain no solid particles so they require little to no digestion. This means that they are very unlikely to cause problems making them a great choice for expectant mothers during early pregnancy.   Eating clear soups and broths can be combined with the BRAT diet to ensure that you are getting all of your required vitamins and nutrients. When following this diet, try to eat five or six smaller meals a day, rather than three large ones, as this further decreases the chance of diarrhea and helps to keep your energy levels up. Spicy foods and food that contains high amounts of fat are much more likely to cause diarrhea, as they are difficult to digest and may irritate the gastrointestinal tract.  Stay away from high fat meat products such as bacon and fatty red meat. Instead, opt for low-fat proteins such as turkey, skinless chicken breasts and white fish. You should also avoid cooking with too much oil or butter. Stay away from spicy foods such as most Asian, Indian and Mexican cuisines. Avoid cooking with hot spices or peppers at home. Many women become lactose intolerant during pregnancy, which means that you may experience diarrhea after drinking milk or eating other dairy products.  The one exception to this is yogurt containing live bacteria such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium. The organisms in the yogurt help to kill harmful bacteria in the digestive system that cause diarrhea. If you do eat dairy products, opt for the low-fat varieties, as these are less likely to irritate the digestive system. Some women are particularly sensitive to certain types of foods during pregnancy, even foods that they ate on a regular basis before getting pregnant.  As a result, it can be difficult to identify exactly which foods are causing the problem. Therefore, it may be a good idea to keep a food diary, where you make a note of all of the foods that you eat and the corresponding bowel movements. This will help you to identify which foods are causing the diarrhea, so you can make an effort to avoid them in future. Diarrhea often leads to dehydration, as you are losing a lot of fluid through your bowel movements. As a result, it is important to drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Aim to drink a minimum of six 8 oz. glasses of water per day, and more if possible. You can also stay hydrated by sucking on ice cubes or water-based popsicles, drinking plenty of herbal teas, and eating fruit and veg with a high water content, such as watermelon, cucumber, tomatoes, beets and grapes."

      "If you don’t know the shy guy you’re interested in, start to catch his attention with subtle moves. Try smiling at him during class or over lunch, and make eye contact for 2 or 3 seconds before looking away. You never know, maybe the guy has had his eye on you for a while too. If that’s the case, your open, engaging behavior may give him a needed confidence-boost and lead to conversations and dates. Physical touch can indicate personal, romantic interest. A touch on the arm or pat on the shoulder is fine. However, if he seems fine with it, then you should continue to do it every once in a while. As the 2 of you get to know each other a little better, try giving him hugs or touching his hand to get his attention. If the guy recoils when you touch him, lay off of physical touch for a couple weeks. He may warm up to the idea more once you two know each other better. If the guy has a Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter account, follow his page and leave a few “likes” and comments. This won’t come across as overbearing or intimidating, and will give him a chance to think about his reply to your post. You can even “Like” a few of his pictures, and leave a slightly flirty comment on one or two of them. Find a picture in which he looks good, and comment something like “Wow! You look amazing,” or “I wish I’d been there with you!”",
      "Small talk is usually rather impersonal and can consist of topics like: the homework, weather, teachers, vacation plans, or something on the news. If you don’t go to school with him, maybe ask what he likes to do other than homework, and school. If the conversation goes well, try talking to him again later in the week.  Say something like, “Hi, I think we’re in the same Physics class! What did you think of that homework last night? It took me several hours.” Don’t worry if you’re doing most of the talking for the first few conversations. It might take the guy a few conversations to start opening up to you. A direct approach is best; don’t try to play games or to get his number from somebody else. Getting his phone number is a flirty move that will let him know you’re interested in him as a potential romantic partner. It will also allow the 2 of you to have more drawn-out conversations.  Say something like, “Hey, I’ve enjoyed talking to you at school for the past couple of weeks. It’d be fun if we could keep the conversation going when we’re not together; could I get your number?” Remember, if he doesn’t text you first, don’t sweat it. If he’s shy in person with you, he’ll be shy over text at first too! By talking to him a few times a week, you will begin to establish a bond and let him know that you’re interested in being more than an occasional conversation partner. Until he opens up to you fully, try to lead the conversation by asking him questions. This will encourage him to talk more and even confide in you. Ask things like:  “My family and I usually take a trip up to Aspen every winter. Do you travel often with your family?” “I like your shirt; The Ramones are a great band. Do you have a favorite record by them?” Asking him out is a great way to move things to the next level, and it’ll also let him know unequivocally where you stand regarding the relationship. Make sure to ask him out in private so that the guy doesn’t feel nervous. Shy people can be very protective of their emotions, and he may hate feeling pressured.  Say something like, “You know, I like being around you, and it’s been fun to get to know you better. Would you like to go out on a date sometime?” “I’m attracted to you and I’d like it if we could spend more time together. Can we go out sometime; we could get coffee or see a movie?”",
      "The shy guy may not have a lot of personal confidence, or may need engaging activities to help bring him out of his shell. In either case, try to find an activity or environment that you’ll both feel comfortable and at-ease in. Go to a volunteering event together, or have lunch at a café nearby. Make sure that you’ll enjoy the date too! If the guy loves mini golf but you can’t stand it, find a different activity. Just because the guy you’re interested in is shy doesn’t mean that he’s a social recluse. So, throw a small party and invite a few people you know he’ll be comfortable with. Make it fun by trying some ice-breaking games and a bottle of wine (if you’re all over 21).  Or, invite the guy to meet a few of your friends at a coffee shop or an art museum. If the guy likes movies, invite him to see a movie with you and a couple friends. Fancy, extravagant dates can lead to high-pressure, uncomfortable situations, especially for a shy guy. The good news is that there are plenty of ways for the 2 of you to spend time together doing things that aren’t stereotypical dates. Take hikes or go cycling together, do a fun bar-hop on a weekday evening, or go sledding in winter.  For example, maybe going out to public places is not his thing. Suggest a movie at your house or something else that’s low-key. You could also suggest getting drive-through dinner and parking someplace quiet to eat and talk. During your time together, listen to what he says so that you can get a feel for what he's comfortable doing. For example, if he says loud places make him uncomfortable, then you'll know not to invite him to a concert."

      "The marking, or hallmark, tells you what percentage of gold an item consists of. The hallmark is often printed on jewelry clasps or the inner bands of rings. It is usually visible on the surface of coins and bullion. The stamp is a number from 1 to 999 or 0K to 24K depending on what kind of grading system was used.  Use a magnifying glass to help you identify the hallmark. It can be tough to make out by eye, especially on smaller pieces of gold such as rings. Older pieces of jewelry may not have visible hallmarks. Sometimes the hallmark wears off over time, while in other cases the jewelry never got a stamp. Hallmarking became common in the 1950s in some areas, but in India for instance, it only became mandatory in the year 2000. Most coins and jewelry are not pure gold, so they have other metals mixed in. There are 2 different scales used to indicate this through the hallmark. The number rating system used in Europe runs from 1 to 999 with 999 meaning pure gold. The U.S. uses a scale from 0 to 24K, where 24K is pure gold.  The number rating system is easier to read than the karat rating system. For example, a rating of 375 means your item consists of 37.5% gold. What number means gold depends on the country you are in. In the U.S., for example, anything 9K and under is not considered to be gold, even though a 9K bracelet consists of 37.5% gold. Counterfeit pieces may have markings making them look authentic, so don’t go solely on the hallmark unless you’re certain you are holding gold. Some of the common letters you may see are GP, GF, and GEP. These letters indicate that your gold piece is plated, which means the maker put a thin layer of gold over another metal, such as copper or silver. Your item has some gold in it, but it isn’t considered to be real gold.  GP stands for gold plated, GF means gold filled, and GEP means gold electroplate. The markings vary a little depending on where the gold is from. For instance, gold from India contains a small triangle symbol indicating the government council responsible for the rating system. It then has a number rating and a letter code, such as K, for the jeweler. Gold is pretty soft for a metal, so plated gold often rubs away over time. The best places to check are around the edges of jewelry and coins. These spots often rub up against your skin and clothing throughout the day. If you see a different metal underneath the gold, you know your item is plated and not considered real gold. For example, a silver coloring might indicate silver or titanium. A red coloring could mean copper or brass. Pure gold doesn’t react with sweat or oil from your skin, so if you see black or green marks, they are from other metals. Silver leaves behind black marks and copper leaves behind green marks. If you see a lot of these marks on your skin, your gold may be less pure than you expect. Keep in mind that most gold items are blends of gold and other metals. Even something like a 14K piece of jewelry, 58.3% gold, can leave these marks. Use other tests as well to ensure your gold is authentic.",
      "If you have a decent kitchen scale, place the gold on it. Otherwise, jewelers and appraisers often can do it for you for free. Call around to different jewelry or appraisal stores to see which ones offer this service. Make sure you get the weight in grams rather than ounces. You need the weight in grams to use in a calculation later. If the weight is in ounces, you won’t get an accurate result. Choose a cylinder that is big enough to hold the gold. It needs to have measurement markings in milliliters (mL) or cubic centimeters (cc). If you don’t have a regular graduated cylinder, you could try using a kitchen measuring cup.  Vials with frequent millimeter markings on the side are useful for getting a more accurate measurement during the test. The amount of water you use doesn’t matter that much as long as you leave plenty of space for the gold. If you fill the vial to the top, dropping the gold into it causes the water to spill. Look at the markings on the cylinder, then record the water level. This measurement is very important for the test, so write it down. Make sure you have the vial on a flat, level surface in order to get as accurate a reading as possible. Keep in mind that it doesn’t matter if your vial is marked in milliliters or cubic centimeters. They are the same measurement, so either unit can be used in the test. Gently lower the gold into the cylinder to avoid losing any of the water. Let go of it right above the water to prevent splashing or getting your fingers wet. Then, read the markings again to get the second measurement. Write the second measurement down on a piece of paper. Note that this is the second measurement, not the initial one. Perform a simple calculation to figure out how much water the gold displaced. Subtract the initial measurement, the smaller number, from the final measurement. This gives you an answer in milliliters or cubic centimeters, depending on what measurement your vial lists. For example, if you started with 17 mL (0.57  fl oz) of water that rose to 18 mL (0.61  fl oz), that leaves a 1 mL (0.034  fl oz) difference. The density of the gold equals its mass divided by its volume. After calculating the density, compare the result to the standard density of gold, which is 19.3 g/mL. If your number is way off, chances are you have a fake. Keep in mind, though, that some combinations of metals in fake gold can have a density similar to real gold.  For instance, you have a gold item that weighs 38 g (1.3 oz) and displaces 2 mL (0.068  fl oz) of water. Divide 38 by 2 to get 19 g/mL, which is very close to the density of gold. The standard density differs a little depending on the type of gold you have. For 14k yellow gold, it’s about 12.9 to 13.6 g/mL. For 14K white gold, it’s around 14 g/mL. A piece of 18K yellow gold has an average density from 15.2 to 15.9 g/mL. A piece of 18K white gold has a density from 14.7 to 16.9 g/mL. Any 22K piece of gold has a density around 17.7 to 17.8 g/mL.",
      "Testing kits include various bottles of nitric acid for different types of gold. Some tests also include a flat rock called a touchstone you can use to scratch off some of the gold on your item. You may also see needles with samples of yellow and white gold to use as a comparison to your item. Testing kits are available online. Also, check with local jewelry stores. Most jewelers use this test for its accuracy. Choose an inconspicuous location on the jewelry to make the scratch, such as underneath a clasp or an inner band. Then, use a sharp tool such as a jewelry engraver to dig into the gold. Scratch until you get underneath the top layer of gold. Expose a fresh layer of gold or any other metal underneath it. Nitric acid tests require you to scratch your piece of gold. If the gold has personal value to you or you plan on keeping it, take it to a professional jeweler instead of doing the test yourself. Put on latex gloves and work in a well-ventilated room to avoid any issues with the dangerous acid. When you’re ready, look for the bottle of acid labeled for 18K gold. After setting the gold in a stainless steel container, place a drop of the acid directly on the scratch you made, then watch for it to turn a shade of green. If it turns green, you know right away your gold is fake.  Regular gold does not react to the acid, so your item might be gold plated or a low-purity blend of metals. A milk-colored reaction usually indicates gold-plated sterling silver. If the acid turns gold, you have gold-plated brass. If you think you might have real gold, rub it along the touchstone to create a streak of gold flakes. Add a drop of 12K, 14K, 18K, and 22K nitric acid to different parts of the streak. Check back after 20 to 40 seconds. Find the spot where the acid doesn’t dissolve the gold to figure out what karat rating your item is. The acids all increase in strength, so the acid used for 22K is stronger than the 12K one. If the 18K acid dissolves the gold but the 14K one doesn’t, you know your item is probably around 14K.",
      "Get container big enough to hold both the water and the gold you wish to test. The water temperature you use doesn’t really matter, so lukewarm water is fine. Real gold is a dense metal, so it falls directly to the bottom of the jug. Imitation gold is much lighter and floats. Real gold also doesn’t rust or tarnish when wet, so if you see a discoloration, you probably have plated gold. For this test, you need a strong magnet capable of pulling even metal blends. Move the magnet over the gold and observe how it reacts. Gold isn’t magnetic, so don’t be fooled by anything that sticks. If the magnet pulls the gold toward it, your item is either impure or a fake.  Regular kitchen magnets won’t do. Buy a powerful neodymium magnet from a home improvement store. The magnet test isn’t foolproof, since counterfeit gold can be made with non-magnetic metal like stainless steel. Also, some genuine gold items are made with magnetic metals such as iron. Make sure you’re using an unglazed piece of ceramic since anything with a glaze could affect the test results. Drag your item across the plate until you see some fragments coming off the gold. If you see a black streak, that means your gold is not real. A gold streak usually indicates authentic gold.  Try getting an unglazed ceramic tile or a plate online or from your local home improvement store. This test scratches the gold a little bit but doesn’t typically leave much noticeable damage. It is much safer than other tests involving scratches or acid. Another way to do this is by spreading some cosmetic foundation on your skin and dragging the gold across it after it dries. Fake gold usually reacts with the foundation, leaving a green or black streak in it."

      "Making a crocheted wreath is one of the easiest types of Christmas ornaments that you can crochet, but you will need a few things to complete this project. You will need:  A ball of green yarn (medium weight). A size J (size 10) hook. Embellishments of your choice, such as pompoms, sequins, buttons, ribbon, etc. A pair of scissors. White glue or hot glue. To start your wreath, make a single chain of 10 crocheted loops. Then, connect the first loop with the last loop to form a circle. This will be the base of your wreath and you will build on it by crocheting around the outer edges. To connect the first and last loops, insert the crochet hook through the first and last loops, and then loop your yarn over the hook and pull this loop through. To begin building your wreath outwards, you will need to crochet around the outer edges of your circle using the hook. Use a double crochet stitch to expand the wreath outwards. You can make the wreath as wide as you like, but you should only need to stitch one to three times around the circle. When you have made the circle as wide as you want it to be, you can connect the ends and close it off. To do this, take your hook with the last loop you created still on it and insert it into a nearby loop. After you pass the hook through this loop, wrap the yarn over the needle and then pull it through. To secure the last loop, crochet one more loop from the free end of the yarn, cut the end of the yarn, and then pull it tight to make a knot. You can sew this end into the edge of your wreath with a darning needle. To embellish your wreath, you will can add buttons, sequins, pompoms, ribbon, or any other embellishments that you want to add. Use a white glue or a hot glue gun to secure the embellishments on the wreath. You can use any color of embellishments that you like. To hang your wreath on a Christmas tree, you will need to add an ornament hook or a piece of yarn. If you are using yarn, then tie together the ends of a 6” to 8” piece of yarn. Then, use your crochet hook to loop this yarn through the top of your wreath and then pull it through itself to secure the yarn. You can use the loop to hang the wreath ornament on your tree.",
      "Before you start your candy cane Christmas ornament, get everything together that you will need to complete the project. You will need:  A ball of red yarn and a ball of white yarn (Caron Simply Soft is a good choice). A size H (size 8) hook. A pair of scissors. A darning needle. To start your candy cane, you will need to create a chain of 40 stitches. This may seem like it will result in a large candy cane, but your final result will be small enough to hang on a Christmas tree. You will need a coil of red and a coil of white yarn, but you can create these one at a time. Start with the white or red and then do the other coil after you finish the first. After you have your 40 stitches, you will need to count back to the fourth stitch from the one that is currently on your hook. Insert your needle through this loop and then wrap your yarn over the hook and pull the yarn through both loops. Then, chain three loops and repeat the double crochet stitch on the next stich. Then, move to the next loop, and continue to chain three and double crochet down to the bottom of the chain. As you do this, the stitches will form a coil. You do not have to do anything but continue to double crochet and this coiling effect will happen. After you finish your first coil, pick up your other ball of yarn and create the second coil. To create the candy cane stripe effect, you will need to intertwine the coils you have just created. Carefully line up the ends and then swirl one coil around the other. The coils should fit together easily. The coils will form a candy cane shape when you hang them on the tree by the part of the coils that will be the curve of the candy cane. Try shaping the cane into the position that you want it to be in when you hang it on the tree. To hold the coils together and create a loop to hang them on your tree at the same time, take a 6” to 8” piece of yarn and tie the ends in a knot. Then, use the hook of your crochet needle to pull the loop through the top of the curved part of your candy cane. Pull the loop through itself to secure it. Then, hang your candy cane ornament on a Christmas tree!",
      "You may already have everything you need to make a Christmas tree ornament, but take a moment to check. You will need:  A ball of green yarn (medium weight). A size J (size 10) hook. Embellishments of your choice, such as pompoms, sequins, buttons, ribbon, etc. A pair of scissors. White glue or hot glue. . One of the easiest ways to make a Christmas tree ornament is to crochet a triangle first. There are a few different ways that you can do this, and the method you choose depends on how you you’re your tree to look. For example, you could create a circle and then crochet outwards to make a rounded triangle shape, or you could create a foundation chain and then crochet in rows, decreasing with each row until you have created the shape you want. When your triangle is complete, you can stop there and just add some embellishments, or you can crochet a square to use as the tree stump. Use some brown yarn to create your tree stump.  To crochet a square, create a foundation chain of four stitches and then crochet across the chain suing a single crochet stitch. Continue crocheting back and forth until the square is the size that you want it to be. Secure your tree stump to the bottom of the triangle using a darning needle and some brown or green yarn. Next, you will need to decorate your tree. You can use any kind of embellishment that you want, such as pompoms, ribbon, sequins, or buttons. Use some white glue or a hot glue gun to attach your embellishments to the crocheted tree. If you are using white glue, then make sure that you let the glue dry overnight. You may also want to place a book or other heavy object over the tree to press the embellishments into the yarn and improve the bond. To complete your project, attach an ornament hook or a piece of yarn to the top of your tree. You can loop an ornament hook through the top of the tree or thread some yarn through the top and tie it in a knot. Hang your crocheted Christmas tree ornament on your Christmas tree, and you are all done!"

      "One of the most recognizable symptoms of avoidant personality disorder is an intense feeling of discomfort in social situations, beyond what might be considered \"normal\" shyness. People with this disorder may appear scared or extremely tense whenever they are in a situation that requires them to interact with other people. People with avoidant personality disorder often do not have any close friends or romantic relationships. This may be due to the fact that they often consider themselves socially inept.  When they do get involved in romantic relationships, people with avoidant personality disorder are likely to still display extreme restraint due to an intense fear of rejection. Although they have a difficult time forging close relationships with others, most people with avoidant personality disorder want close relationships and may have detailed fantasies about what it would be like to have them. People who have avoidant personality disorder tend to avoid situations that would involve interactions with other people. This may involve school, work, or recreational activities.  Many people with avoidant personality disorder also avoid any activities that are new or unfamiliar, for fear of embarrassing themselves. People with avoidant personality disorder tend to be extremely sensitive to criticism, or even to perceived criticism. They may constantly feel that others are judging them, even when they are reassured to the contrary.  Some people with avoidant personality disorder will avoid activities that they believe they will do poorly at in order to avoid being criticized for their poor performance. They may expect to be criticized in situations that other people would not take seriously, such as a game. People with avoidant personality disorder tend to overestimate the negative aspects of situations. You may notice that they fixate on potential problems and make them seem much more serious than they are.",
      "If you think that you or someone you know may have avoidant personality disorder, the first step in getting a diagnosis is to see a doctor for an exam. The doctor will want to rule out any physical conditions that may be causing the symptoms. This appointment will consist of a physical exam, as well as a detailed examination of the patient's personal and family history. If no physical conditions are identified, the doctor will most likely refer the patient to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist. Mental health professionals are specially trained to diagnose personality disorders, including avoidant personality disorder.   This appointment will consist of a detailed interview. The psychiatrist or psychologist will want to know all about the symptoms the patient is experiencing, when they started, and how they have progressed over time. There is not medical test that can be performed to diagnose avoidant personality disorder. A diagnosis is made based on the observations of the patient's behavior and reported symptoms. Once a patient is diagnosed, he or she will be encouraged to enter psychotherapy to help overcome the symptoms of avoidant personality disorder. Some people with avoidant personality disorder also suffer from other mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. A thorough psychiatric evaluation should reveal whether any other conditions are complicating the symptoms of avoidant personality disorder. For patients who also suffer from anxiety or depression, medications may be helpful in reducing symptoms. Medications are typically not helpful for patients whose only diagnosis is avoidant personality disorder, however.",
      "Both avoidant personality disorder and schizoid personality disorder can cause people to avoid social interactions with others, but there is a very important difference between the two. People with avoidant personality disorder are typically very troubled by their isolation and want to get involved with others, while people with schizoid personality disorder usually are not distressed by their lack of interaction. Social anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder are extremely similar, so it may be impossible for someone who is not trained in psychology to distinguish one from the other. Typically, individuals with avoidant personality disorder display more symptoms than those with social anxiety disorder, and their symptoms tend to be more inhibiting.  Individuals who display only a few of the symptoms of avoidant personality disorder may in fact have social anxiety disorder, but it is important that a trained mental health professional make this diagnosis. Some people may be diagnosed with both avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety disorder, which further complicates the distinction between the two conditions. Avoidant personality disorder is not the only psychiatric condition that can cause individuals to lack self-confidence and feel inadequate. Before assuming that an individual has avoidant personality disorder, consider other, similar personality disorders.  Like people with avoidant personality disorder, people with histrionic personality disorder tend to lack self-esteem. The major difference is that people with histrionic personality disorder tend to go out of their way to seek the approval and validation of others, often in an unhealthy or destructive way, while people with avoidant personality disorder instead avoid contact with others. Dependent personality disorder is also characterized by a lack of self-worth and fear of abandonment. However, people with dependent personality tend to latch on to a specific individual instead of avoiding all social interactions. People with dependent personality disorder also tend to have a difficult time making decisions on their own, which is not characteristic of avoidant personality disorder."

      "Use a cardboard box, and cut holes in it for ventilation. Place something soft in the bottom, such as a towel. You can also use other types of pet carriers, such as cat carriers, if the bird is large. You should have something to cover the box or cage, such as a towel, as it is best to keep the animal in the dark and quiet. However, you shouldn't use a wire carrier, as that can cause harm to the bird. You can use either a heating pad (set on low) or hot water in a zip-top bag. If you use the heating pad, place it on the outside of the box at one end. If you use the zip-top bag, wrap it in cloth, and set it inside the box with the bird. Even small birds can cause damage to your hands. Put on a thick pair of gloves before attempting to help the bird. Before trying to move the bird, cover it with cloth to help calm it. Though the bird is injured, it can still cause you and itself harm if you startle it. It likely will fight back. Close the lid, and cover it with the towel. Keep the bird in a warm, quiet place while you work on your next steps. Make sure your pets do not have access to the area where you place the bird. Even with gloves on, it's important to wash your hands and arms after handling wildlife, as they can spread bacteria and disease. You will likely get the diet of the bird wrong. You can provide water so that the bird can drink on their own, but don't try to drip-feed the bird water. This way, the bird will be able to drink water even if it's dehydrated.",
      "You might think a baby bird needs help, but it may just be the bird is learning how to fly. Watch the bird for a while from a distance to establish it really is injured and has been abandoned by the mother.  Look for feathers. If a baby bird has feathers, it is likely learning to fly.  You can put featherless baby birds back in the nest if they're not injured. If a bird feels cold, warm it in your hands before setting it back in the nest. The scent of your hands will not bother the parents, who will feed it as they do the other babies.   If you don't see a nest, put the bird somewhere where it is hidden from cats and dogs. For instance, you can set it in a bush or tree. If you see a gaping wound, that is an indication an adult bird needs help, and you may need to rescue it. Blood is another indication a bird is in trouble. If the bird is dripping blood or if you see dried blood, it may need help. If the bird is having trouble standing or flying, it is in serious trouble and needs help. It may be best to leave the bird where it is until you can get help from a professional. Big birds, such as hawks, can cause you serious harm if you don't know what you're doing.",
      "This is important, as a wildlife rehabilitator will know how to care for a wild animal like the bird you found. You can usually find lists of local rehabilitators on local and statewide government wildlife websites. You can also call veterinarians for recommendations. In fact, it's illegal for a person without a license to attempt to rehabilitate a wild animal or bird without help from a licensed professional. Birds are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, making it illegal for you to keep one in your possession without a license. The rehabilitator may tell you how to care for the bird, or they may tell you it's best to bring it to someone who is licensed to care for it. Either way, you'll know how to move forward. Birds have diverse requirements for diet and care, and wild birds do not adapt well to captivity. Animals that are rehabilitated face one of four fates. The best option is the bird will recover and be released back into the wild. If it is not possible to release the bird back into the wild, the bird will be placed at an appropriate facility and used to educate people. The other two options are not as pleasant. The bird may die from the condition, or it may need to be put to sleep if the injury is too severe. If you insist on keeping the bird, you will need to be licensed, as it is illegal to keep wildlife without a permit or license. You can apply for the proper paperwork through your local government.  To obtain a license, you need to fill out the permit form from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the federal government, as well as a form for your state government. To be permitted to rehabilitate animals, you need to have the knowledge and expertise to care for wild animals. You will need to answer questions about your knowledge, as well as about how you were trained to care for animals."

      "Dip the brush into the paint, then use it to reach spots a paint roller can't get. It's perfect for covering the door's corners and the ridges around the windows. Tackle these difficult spots first since the paint bunches there. Angled paint brushes can be purchased from a home improvement store. Mini foam paint rollers are the perfect size for French doors. Pour some paint into a paint tray and roll the roller through it. When it is evenly coated, you are ready to paint. Begin right away so the paint on the door does not have time to dry. Using a brush is possible here. Using one is slower, so the paint may begin to dry before you finish. Use the roller on the wide, flat parts of the door. Focus on 1 side at a time. Move the roller at a steady pace to apply an even coat of paint. Cover all the areas the roller can reach. Read the instructions on the paint can for the recommended drying time. It is usually about 2 hours. Once the paint has set, go back over it with a second coat of paint. Use the roller again on large areas and the brush on small areas. If you use a dark color, you will most likely need to apply a third coat of paint to make the doors look perfect. Again, read the manufacturer's instructions to find out how long the paint takes to dry. It usually dries after a few hours, but you can give it a little more time to ensure it sets. It's best to wait a whole day before attempting to peel paint off the glass. Any paint splashed on them should be dry by now. Peel off the tape, noticing any paint spots on the glass. Finish the job with a razor blade scraper from the hardware store. Hold the tool flat against the glass, positioning it so the blade points towards the paint. Dig the blade under the paint as you push it towards the end of the glass. The paint should break into strips you can peel off with your fingers. If the paint is stuck, cut into it using a utility knife or box cutter. Be careful not to push too hard or else you might scratch the glass. Then try scraping off the paint again.",
      "Always take precautions when working with primer and paint. Open up any nearby doors and windows to let in fresh air. Consider wearing a respirator so you don't end up breathing in fumes. Use painter's tape to cover up these parts. Stick the tape directly to the door knobs, around the area that attaches to the door. Tape over the hinges to protect them. Also apply tape around the outside edge of any glass panels in the doors. Taping the windows is tedious. If you are using latex paint and don't mind scraping paint off them later, you can leave the windows uncovered. The lock set is the metal piece on the frame's side next to the door knobs. You will need a Phillips head screwdriver to remove it. Loosen it by turning the screws counterclockwise. Slide the lock set out, then wrap tape around it. Push it back into the door and screw it in place. Pick up a bucket of paint primer from a home improvement store. Dip a brush in it and spread it onto the doors. Move slowly to paint on an even layer. Read the label to make sure the primer is compatible with the paint you intend on using. You cannot use a latex primer under an oil-based paint. Check the manufacturer's instructions on the label for the recommended drying time. Primer takes about 3 hours to dry completely. You can leave it longer to ensure it dries, but paint as soon as possible to limit the amount of dust settling on the doors. If dust settles on the door, wipe it off with a dry cloth before painting.",
      "While you can remove the doors to paint them, leaving them in the door frame makes the job easier. Protect your floors by spreading a plastic tarp out under the doors. You can purchase a tarp at a home improvement store or wherever else paint supplies are sold. Cardboard and other absorbent scrap material can be used as a makeshift tarp. If your doors have any marks or dents, now is the time to take care of them. Rub the spot to wear away the material around it. Keep doing this until the damage disappears, then sand the surrounding areas to blend them in and smooth out the finish. If you still have trouble with these spots, try using rougher sandpaper or an orbital sander. Lightly rub the sandpaper against the doors to even them out and ready them for new paint. Go over every surface, including ones you treated with heavier sandpaper. The doors should look smooth and even once you are done. When sanding, always start with the coarser sandpaper. Then use the finer sandpaper to smooth the surface. Fill a bucket with about 1 US gal (3.8 L) of water. Mix in about a tablespoon of an all-purpose dish soap. Your regular dish soap works fine unless it is designed for harsher stains like grease. The water temperature doesn't matter too much. To stay safe, keep it cool or lukewarm. Dip a clean microfiber cloth into the soapy water. Get the cloth damp but not dripping. Squeeze out any excess water first, then thoroughly wipe the doors to remove all of the grime, oil, and sawdust that has accumulated over time. Get another microfiber cloth and go back over the doors. They have to be completely dry. This second pass should finish removing all of the grime that can ruin the paint job. Move onto priming right away while the doors are clean."

      "Trigger capos work by using a spring-loaded clamp to hold their tension. This clamp is simply is squeezed to open and close the capo. Players like trigger capos because they can be quickly and easily repositioned using just one hand, making them great for live performances. This is the recommended type of capo for beginners, as it is simple and easy to use. Screw capos work using an adjustable knob that can be screwed to your desired amount of pressure. The downfall about screw capos is their impracticality – it's hard to do a live show when you have to keep screwing and unscrewing your capo in place. However, these capos are sometimes preferred when recording music because of the amount of control they give the guitar player. This design combines the speed of a trigger capo with the precision of a screw capo. Shubb capos use a simple lever, which can be adjusted for tension, and can easily be flipped on or off. Though they’re more expensive than the previous capos mentioned, they are very popular amongst seasoned guitar players. The G7th performance capos have become a favorite amongst many guitar players, as they are gentle, practical, and give the player great control. These capos allow for easy tension adjustment – all you need to do is squeeze it down over the desired location, and the G7th performance capo automatically locks in place. To release the capo, all you have to do is flip a lever. Some reviews claim that this capo is actually better at preserving the tone of your guitar as well.",
      "All voices are different, so the original keys of some songs may not be a fit for every singer. Capos come in handy when you have to find a new key of a song for a singer. Using a capo will allow you to play the song in the new key without having to learn entirely new chords. A guitar capo can do much more than simply change the key of a song, it can create an entirely different sonic experience. For example, playing in the key of A with and without a capo will have entirely different feels even though you're playing in the same key, so experiment with your capo to hear the differences. Essentially, you'll be suing different voicing to play the same chords, which produce entirely different sounds."

      "Although you’re working on a team, you’ll likely complete some of the work alone. Don’t expect your teammates to take responsibility for keeping you on track. Be a self-starter by staying on top of your assignments, creating deadlines for yourself, and meeting project expectations. This also shows your supervisor and teammates that you’re able to work independently of the team. This shows leadership skills, while also making you a valuable part of the team. Sharing your thoughts shows that you have more to offer and are thinking outside the box. Even if your ideas aren’t right for the project, they might lead to future innovations on a different project. When you have team meetings, always contribute something to the discussion. If you have trouble thinking on the spot, brainstorm before the meeting so you have some ideas about what you have to say. This is another way to show that you’re not only a good team member but also an independent worker. Step up to lead a project, knock out a backlog of unfinished tasks, or complete a side project for your supervisor. Then, complete the extra work as quickly as possible.  You’ll show your independence by setting priorities between each of your work tasks, creating new deadlines for yourself, and following through on your promises. When you take on these extra projects, you’ll quickly gain a reputation for being a self-starter and an asset to the organization. Make sure that you don't take on too much work. You'll need to balance your new projects with your current work assignments. Know your schedule so you don't accidentally put too much on your plate.",
      "If you have a choice on who you’ll work with, look for people who are different from you. Although it’s tempting to pick similar people so your work will go smoothly, it’s better to have diverse ideas and skill sets on your team, as you’ll be able to be more creative.  If everyone has the exact same perspective and skill set, it will be harder to divide the work because everyone will want to do the same things. For instance, let's say you're working on a project to design a brochure. If everyone on your team enjoys graphic design, you'll all want to create the brochure, instead of tasks like conducting research on your topic. Additionally, your group won’t be as innovative in your ideas because you won’t be coming at the topic from different perspectives. For example, team members from different socioeconomic backgrounds might have experienced a community issue in a different way, giving them a different perspective on it. Talk to your teammates to find out their background, strengths, weaknesses, and interests. Determine what you each bring to the table. Try to find ways you can complement each other’s skills so your team can work well together.  If you're the team leader, you might host a planning meeting and invite everyone to share their skills. If you're not in a leadership position, talk to people one-on-one. Look for ways that you can bring something new to the team. For example, let's say you find out your teammates are strong in skills like networking with clients, statistics, and design. Although you might also be strong in networking and design, you could offer to use your writing skills to complement the skills of your teammates. A team can only thrive if everyone feels valued and heard. Not all ideas are winners, but the group must still listen to them and consider if they’re a good idea for this project. Make it a priority to collaborate as much as possible.  If team members start to feel as though their ideas don’t matter, they’ll stop being an active part of the team. This will hurt your overall output as you’re losing valuable ideas and expertise. For example, you might host round table meetings to encourage participation. If you feel like people on your team aren't listening to you, talk to your team lead about it. Say, \"At the past three meetings, I've tried to offer input on the project, but I keep getting interrupted. Do you think we can try a round table approach so we can also share our ideas?\" It’s important that all team members are working on the same goals, rather than each person pursuing personal aspirations. Discuss your goals as a team and adopt the goals that everyone agrees on. Moving forward, you can change or adapt your goals as needed, as long as everyone provides input.  Be as active in the goal setting process as possible. If your team leadership already set goals for your group, you might not get a voice in the process. For example, your team might start out with 3 goals: “1) Design a survey to gather public input about our park project; 2) Distribute the survey to residents; and 3) Evaluate the survey results to determine how to proceed with phase 2 of our planning project.” This can include explaining the expectations or asking questions if you find them unclear. It’s likely that each teammate has a different idea about what’s expected of them, as well as what everyone else needs to be doing. It’s essential that the team discuss these expectations and agree on one universal list of expectations that everyone will follow.  If you're not a leader on your team, you may not be setting expectations. However, it is important that you understand them, so ask questions if you're confused. Write down the expectations and make sure everyone on the team has a copy. For example, you might email the copy to everyone or post it in a communal Google Drive folder. Examples of expectations might be “everyone completes their work on time,” “check team communications daily,” “upload all work to the communal folder,” etc. When you can, meet in person so you can have a free exchange of ideas. If this isn't possible, schedule a group phone call or digital conference through service providers like Google or Skype.  Teams are most effective when they collaborate, so brainstorming sessions are a great tool for good teamwork. Make sure each teammate is taking notes during the meeting so that you can all recall your ideas later. Choose one method of communication. Make sure all team members have access to the means of communication so everyone is on the same page. Otherwise, your group may not work effectively, as some group members may be unaware of what’s happening.  For example, all group members might participate on a group text message or email. If you have no control over how communication is handled, that's okay! Follow along with the guidelines set up by your group leader. When you’re on a team, everyone’s success depends on each member working toward a common goal. If you’re thinking about your own glory, you’ll be undermining the team. Keep your focus on your team’s success, and your own success will follow.  It’s helpful to remember that a team failure will reflect badly on you. Don’t let your personal aspirations get in the way of your team’s success. Let's say your personal goal is to make it onto the management team. Rather than trying to impress your supervisor with your managerial skills, work with your teammates to accomplish your shared goals. Do your best to support the team, which shows you're an asset to the company. Then, you can volunteer for side projects that will help show your full range of skills.",
      "Your actions will reflect on everyone in your group, so do your best to always follow through. Complete your portion of the workload, and speak up as soon as you notice any issues that may arise.  Always keep your promises to the group. If you do need to back out of a promise, take responsibility for it by telling your supervisor, client, or teacher that you had to withdraw from the project. After you notify your supervisor, client, or teacher, tell your team that you've had to back out. Don’t put your group in an awkward situation. No one likes a teammate who barely contributes to the project. Take on an equal part of the work, and speak up if you realize you aren’t doing your fair share. Not only will your group mates appreciate your work ethic, it will show your supervisor or instructor that you’re a good team player.  Keep in mind that some tasks may be harder than others. Make sure you and your teammates create a balanced workload that’s fair to everyone. If you feel like you are doing too much work, tell your team. You might say, “I noticed that our team assignments are a little bit imbalanced. I have extra work assigned to me that I’m hoping we can spread around.” If they still don't take on their fair share, talk to them one-on-one about their perspective on the project. Try to address their reasons for holding back. Then, compare your current roles and invite them to take a more active role in the project. If nothing helps, you may be able to talk to your supervisor or instructor, but doing so can be risky. Make sure you've tried to solve the issue as a team first. Always say what you mean, but use a professional tone. Similarly, don’t waste people’s time by padding the truth or being indirect about how you really feel.  This includes what you say and what you write in reports, memos, emails, or text messages. On a similar note, don’t gossip about or to your teammates. No one likes a credit hog, so don’t steal the spotlight. Treat the team’s accomplishments as a group success. Additionally, acknowledge the individual contributions made by your teammates.  For instance, you might give your teammate credit for having a great idea that helped your team finish your project in half the time. Even if you’re the team leader, it’s important that you not hog the credit. A team success belongs to everyone. If someone really didn't help the team, talk to them about team expectations and how they can contribute moving forward. You or your teammates may need to help manage their workload. If someone else tries to hog the credit, you have a few choices on how to handle the situation. In the moment, you could say, \"Thanks for bringing that up, Sharon. We all worked hard these past few weeks to create this plan.\" If you can't speak up in the moment, confront your colleague calmly to discuss what happened. Ask them to explain why they indicated that they deserved all the credit. If this doesn't help, you may need to involve your supervisor, so make sure you keep records that show who did what as part of the team. People are more likely to enjoy working with you if you have a good attitude. You can improve your attitude by approaching problems as an opportunity, expecting a positive outcome, and adopting habits that improve your workday.  One way to always find the positive outcome is to consider your work never complete until something good comes out of it. Good habits to help your workday go more smoothly might include enjoying a mug of your favorite tea every afternoon, organizing your desk to reduce your stress levels, and enjoying a brief, energizing walk at lunch time.",
      "Talking things out in person will allow a free-flow of information and prevent misunderstandings, which might occur if you bring up the issue in an email. State the issue you're having, then listen to what everyone has to say.  If you're concerned about having a record of the conversation, you can record it using your phone or a voice recorder. If you aren't the group leader, you may prefer to talk to your group leader before talking to the group as a whole. This may be helpful if you'd rather the leader bring up the issue. Don’t accuse or blame anyone on your team for causing the conflict, even if you believe they did. Instead, keep all of your comments and arguments focused on the issue and how your team can solve it.  If you feel attacked by the other person, don’t respond with your own attack. Say something like, “I’m sorry you feel that way, but blaming each other won’t help us solve the conflict. I’d like to stay focused on solutions.” This way, you show that you’re a professional and care more about the project than your ego. You may not have much control about how the conflict is handled. However, you can control what you say and how you react. Keep your words and actions professional. Even if you think you’re right, it’s still important to hear everyone out. Otherwise, your conflict will continue even after you’ve solved this issue, as you’ll create resentments on the team. For instance, you might host a round-table to allow everyone a chance to speak. Don’t respond to each other until everyone has shared their opinion. to each side of the conflict. Focus on what the other person is saying, not what you will say in response. You may even take notes about what they say. Once they're finished speaking, repeat what they said back to them to make sure you really understand what they’re saying.  In most cases, conflict on a team happens because people have different perspectives and backgrounds. This is actually a good thing! Understanding everyone’s opinion and why they feel that way will help you create a better solution to the problem, which eventually helps your team produce better work.  You might paraphrase their words by saying, “It sounds like you think your part of the workload is too heavy and that the rest of us need to do more.” When group members start to disagree, look for opportunities to get creative or go in a different direction. Let conflict be a trigger for brainstorming sessions, with the goal of choosing the best ideas. Make a habit of saving unused ideas or information for use in the future.  Assume that there’s no one way to do something, even if you feel like your ideas are the best. Keep notes about what comes out during your brainstorming sessions so you can refer back to those ideas later. This will help your team resolve conflicts more easily because people know that their ideas are being valued and may be used in the future. You likely won’t win when there’s a conflict in your group, and that’s okay. Whenever possible, teammates should give and take so that everyone gets to direct the group’s efforts. Be open to a compromise that works best for everyone.  If you can’t compromise due to constraints, offer the team members who aren’t getting what they want something else they want. This way they’ll still feel included on the decision. For instance, let's say 2 team members aren't happy with their job assignments, but it's too close to the deadline to switch roles. Your compromise might be phrased like this, \"Although we can't change the roles for this project, Maria and James are going to take the design lead on the upcoming project.\""

      "Guarantee the quality of your products and services. If you believe in them enough to guarantee satisfaction, potential clients may be more likely try out your salon and current clients may be more likely to stay. You want to attract the broadest potential client base to your salon. Buying advertising space on different media such as newspapers, television, radio, or the web can help you increase your business.  Make sure that the advertising you buy fits your needs and remains within the budget you established. Tailor your media coverage based on your location. For example, it’s better to advertise in a larger local newspaper with broader circulation than in a news journal specifically written for your town. People are increasingly getting information from social media accounts. Setting up Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts can help advertise your salon and its services.  Write posts about specials or events happening in your salon. Post pictures of clients and use hashtags to increase your visibility. Offer discounts to those happy customers who stop by to give reviews. In case of bad reviews, listen to the complaints of unsatisfied customers and try to work upon them. Interact with your customers on a regular basis. Staying in regular contact with your target markets by email or regular mail will keep your salon name readily available. It can also direct clients and potential customers to your media accounts or actual salon. For example, you can write a bi-monthly newsletter, but make sure to keep your information concise and the sales pitch at a minimum. Develop different specials or offers for clients that do not decrease your profits. Giving people an incentive can attract them to try out or return to your salon.  Think of something inexpensive, but effective at enticing possible clients. For example, offer a free travel size hair product or a manicure on for birthdays. You can also offer a discount to first time clients or on slower business days.  Christmas is the time when everyone looks for offers and discounts. You can take advantage of the Christmas holiday by giving your customers special Christmas offers and discounts. This will help in attracting new as well as existing customers. Beauty salons rely heavily on word-of-mouth advertising. Train employees how to build clientele through referrals and client relationships. Give a discount or upgrade on later visit to clients who refer a friend.  Be sure your business cards, media sites, and ads mention how clients can \"friend\" you on social media sites. Mention the benefits of being a friend of your beauty salon and consider coupling this with sweepstakes and daily deals offered only through your social media sites.  Develop incentive programs for referrals. For example, you can run a contest for clients who refer the most new customers by rewarding them a free service of their choice. Use other businesses to advertise your salon. You can work out a system where other local businesses display your business cards in their office in exchange for putting theirs in your salon.  You can also consider running promotions with other businesses. For example, you and a local restaurant could offer discounts for visiting both locations. Host special events with other businesses to help defray costs. You could hold a sidewalk sale or a sponsor charity event with a partner business to help draw clients to both companies. Partnering with large, national or international brands can also attract customers. This can help increase your exposure through various types of media. For example, if you sell specific products, make sure the company places your salon name on their site telling under “available at these salons”. Selling a small selection of branded merchandise such as clothing or practical items like combs or brushes can increase exposure in your area. Make sure to keep inventory of these products at a minimum until you know they can sell.",
      "Advertising in a broad range of media during key times of the year may help you to reach thousands of potential new clients. Establishing a media budget before you buy any advertising can help you determine your potential return on investment and keep you from wasting capital.  Consider advertising beyond the Internet with print, radio, or television ads, which will reach a much wider audience than just the Internet. Radio or television ads can be expensive so they may be more appropriate for larger salons. One advantage of spending a little extra money on radio or television ads is that you’ll reach a much wider potential client base. Spend your advertising budget where your potential clients read, listen, or watch, and within a circulation range of no more than 20 miles (32 km) from your business. Create a budget that allows for more advertising campaigns during your busiest times of the year, such as Christmas and Mother’s Day. You’ll want to target the specific market to which you plan to advertise. Figuring out your customer profile will help you advertise your salon most effectively and successfully. To create your customer profile, consider geographic location of your salon, gender, average income level, marital status, education level, and hobbies and interests. Choose a salon name, logo and design that engages your target market(s).  This will help establish your identity and may create a connection between you and your customers or potential clients.  Consider elements such as color schemes, names, and design features.  Think about your location so that your brand matches it. Is your salon is in a quaint tourist region or a major urban area? Take note of successful businesses in your area and draw upon their ideas while keeping your brand distinctive and memorable compared to competitors.  You and your staff are a part of the brand, so make sure to market your skills and talents.  Coining a catchy slogan that can be printed on business cards, uniforms, and staff e-mail signatures can help establish your brand. For example, if your salon promotes holistic and energy based treatments, your slogan could be \"beauty, bliss and beyond\" or \"good energy, great beauty. Once you’ve established the basic parameters of your advertising campaign, you can create the contents of your ads. You can design your own ads or hire an advertising agency, which may help optimize your campaign.  If you decide to use professional help, meet with a several different ad agencies to find the one that best meets your needs and wishes.  An ad agency can either design your web site or may help you find the right web designer. If you decide to design your own ads and website, research local businesses advertising to guide your design. You want your brand to be simple, distinctive, and attractive to your clients and potential customers. Ads are often the first impression potential clients have of you and you’ll want to write your print and radio ads to attract them. Hooking your potential customers and keeping the message simple and concise can help attract a wide array clients.  Design your ads to complement your brand. Use similar color and design schemes so that clients and potential customers associate these elements with you. Include items in your ad such as the salon name, your specialties, and any specials or offers you may have. Keep the information brief and simple so that people can easily remember your salon. Your web site should present a snapshot of the experience a client will enjoy at your salon. It is important that your salon have a professional looking website because it can draw in potential clients and help keep your current customer .  The design should match your brand and mirror the feeling your clients will have when they enter your salon: maybe it's calm and serene; maybe it's vibrant and lively.  Include sections on different services, stylists and their experience and talents, prices, products you sell, and any specials you offer.  Structure the web site so that search engines can easily locate and bring potential clients to it.  Include details like location, phone number, working hours, and email address on your website. Portray other aspects of your business such as the environment and facilities you provide like free coffee, Wi-Fi. Take help of online templates and customize them according to your needs."

      "You may think that your best chance of success comes from showing off, trying to impress the film crew, and boasting about all of your additional skills. Once you've become a veteran stunt man, then sure, you will have more leeway, and you may even be consulted as a stunt coordinator or producer, but when you're trying to get your foot in the door, it's important to be as agreeable as possible.  You want to be remembered as someone who is easy to work with. Why? So you can get hired again. When you're following directions, it's important to be polite and reasonable when you interact with the crew. If you genuinely have a question about how a stunt should be performed, ask away, but don't nitpick everything that's happening or slow down the process. Being a stunt person doesn't mean falling out of a helicopter for three takes and then calling it a day. It can mean over 14 hours on a set, working nights, and staying mentally and physically alert throughout the process. This is a full-time job, and once you start landing enough gigs, you must be able to commit to the time that you'll need to succeed in your role. In the beginning, you may be juggling other work along with stunt work, but if you've hit the big leagues, you must be ready to give it your all. This means that you'll need endurance to succeed at the job. If you get winded after an our of fighting or feel ready for a nap after rock climbing for an afternoon, then you need to build up your mental and physical strength. If you're a true stunt man, then you won't be spending your life filming within a thirty mile radius of your comfy home, not even if you live in Hollywood, CA. You'll be traveling to the Caribbean to film a jet-skiing sequence. You might find yourself in Peru to shoot a rock climbing scene. You might even be in Germany for a high-speed car chase. This means long hours on airplanes, and needing to get over jet lag before you hit those jet-skiis. Sure, this will be exciting, thrilling work, but you'll need to be prepared for all of the travel it involves. As you get older, all of the traveling may become more difficult because you'll have to find a way to make time for your family, if you have one. Most stunt men are at the peak of their careers between their 20s and 40s, which means that you have to stay in the best possible shape during these years. This means not engaging in risky behavior, whether you're on the job or hanging out with friends, and avoiding overindulgence in food or drink, which can wear down your body and make you feel horrible when you show up to work. Eat healthy, get enough rest, and make sure to exercise as often as you can, doing a mixture of cardiovascular and strength training, so you're fit enough to do the job.  Another way to stay strong is to continue to brush up on your skills, whether you're practicing karate or swimming. If you want to stay physically strong, then you have to keep your mind strong, too. You can't let the dangers of the job get to you and you have to stay focused and positive if you want to succeed in the long run. Being a stunt man doesn't mean recklessly jumping out of three story windows, playing with fire, or crashing a motorcycle into a tree because you weren't careful. Stunt men have families, drive, and exciting careers, which means that they love what they do and want to stay alive to continue doing it. When you get training on how to fall without hurting yourself, drive without crashing, and swim without drowning, etc, you should heed those words carefully, and not go out of bounds to show off if it means risking your life.  A study conducted by the University of Illinois at Chicago showed that there were 37 fatalities on film or TV sets between 1980-1989 by stunt men and women alone; a study by the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) showed that 4,998 of its members were injured between the years of 1982-1986, mostly because of stunts. This is a risky business, and you need to stay rational and focused if you don't want to become a statistic. Something can always go wrong, on the set of a Harry Potter movie, Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double David Holmes was left paralyzed and suffered serious spine injures, after a test run for a flying scene went wrong. He is set to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Even if you don't get hurt while demonstrating reckless behavior, you don't want to develop a reputation for being reckless, or no one will want to work with you. What producer would want the reputation of having a stunt man die or fall to serious injury on his set? You need to work on your risk-management skills, not your risk-taking skills. Being a good stunt man is all about being safe, not risking your life.",
      "Specializing can definitely help you land a gig -- if you're an expert martial artist, gymnast, or rock climber, that's great. But the more you know how to do, the more likely you'll be to wow stunt coordinators and to be perfect for roles that require multiple skills. If you want to be a stunt man, then chances are, you're already experienced in a field or two. Here are the most common skills that stunt men can possess:   Fighting: Expert level skills in boxing, combat, or a martial art.  Falling: The ability to fall from a variety of heights, some of which are over three stories high, and the ability to use trampolines.  Riding and driving: High-level skills as a precision driver of cars or motorcycles, or expert level horseback riding skills.  Agility and strength: Superior gymnastics or rock-climbing skills.  Water skills: High level skills in scuba diving, underwater stunts, or advanced swimming.  Miscellaneous sport: A superior skill level in tumbling, fencing, or wirework. If you want to sound like you know what you're talking about when you start your career as a stunt man, then you have to know the terms associated with the career. If a stunt director starts talking about wirework and you have a blank look on your face, you won't get very far. Here's what you need to know:   Wirework: The ability to expertly use rigs, harnesses, and vests to perform aerial stunts, which include flying or falling action sequences.  Tumbling: Performing gymnastics feats safely without using specialized equipment. These include front and back handsprings, somersaults, shoulder rolls, break falls, dive rolls, round-off back and front handsprings, and cartwheels.  High falls: The ability to fall from three stories or higher, while landing on a box catcher or an airbag, without hurting yourself. You should be familiar with a variety of falls, such as twisting falls, headers, and step outs.  Swordplay: Skillfully using swords, foils, or blades while in combat. This includes fencing or choreographed fight scenes.  Horsework: The ability to ride horses skillfully and safely while performing stunts such as falling, jumping onto a horse, and engaging in swordplay while riding.  Air ram: A device that uses compressed air and hydraulics to catapult a stunt person into the air. It's usually used to create the effect of an explosion, propelling the stunt person through the air as he is flying forward, backward, or somersaulting. Though you don't need a bachelor's degree or formal training in any one arena to be a stunt person, it certainly couldn't hurt. You may already be a pro in certain areas from racing motorcycles to being a black belt in karate, but if you want to improve your skill set, then you should find a reputable school in your area, such as Rick Seaman's stunt driving school, which can help give you an edge. These programs will not guarantee you a job and some may cost a pretty penny, but if you need to hone your skills, this may be the safest way to do so. Though going to school to brush up on your skills or to gain new skills is a great way to improve your abilities and make yourself a more marketable and appealing stunt man, another great way to improve your chances of getting hired is to find a mentor. If there is a stunt man you admire, whether it's a stunt driver like Steve Kelso or Andy Gill or a Stunt Director like Spiro Razatos, then you would be very privileged to be able to get under his or her tutelage. This doesn't mean you should annoy famous stunt men, but that if you are around them or find a way to know them, you would benefit greatly if you could ask them for advice on improving your skills. Often, this part can come later, after you've gotten your foot in the door; you won't have much luck finding a mentor in the stunt business if you have no experience whatsoever, unless you have some powerful connections.",
      "If you want to be taken seriously as a professional, then you'll need to get an 8 x 10 inch black and white headshot. You may need to invest some money in a professional photographer, or be careful about finding a trusted and talented friend with a stellar camera, but it will be worth it. You won't be taken seriously if all you have is a selfie or a cheap Polaroid, so make sure to follow through on this part. A good headshot can help you look like a professional, and can also help stunt coordinators or producers see whether you have the look they want. A headshot is like your business card as a stunt man; if you don't have one readily available, then how do you expect people you meet in the business to remember you? You may think that you don't need a résumé to be a stunt man because so much of the work is physical, but that's not the case. You should treat your career just like any other, where a résumé is crucial to helping the people who are hiring you to figure out if you're good for the part. The most important thing is remember is that you have to be honest. Don't try to impress people by saying you have skills you don't really possess, or you will be in trouble -- and even possibly in danger -- if you're picked for the role. Here are some important elements that you should list on your résumé:  Your height, weight, shoe size, and any other physical measurements Your union affiliation (more on this later) Film and TV credits (if you have any) A list of skills or special abilities, such as rock climbing, scuba diving, boxing, or martial arts If you want to find work as a stunt man, then you have to join a union, so that you can be legally hired to perform in films, music videos, or television. In America, the two major unions are the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is the more prestigious of the two, or the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. In England, you will have to join the Join Industry Stunt Committee's Stunt Register (JISC); look into the guilds in your country if these do not apply to you.  Getting into a guild is hard work. One way you can get in, if you're lucky, is to get waved in in case a stunt coordinator isn't able to find a person with the combination of skills and build that you have to do a certain job (for example, if you're four foot five and can climb a mountain). Another way of getting in is to try to get work on a SAG or other union film as an extra for at least three separate days. Get an extras voucher after every day and turn in those three vouchers to make yourself eligible to join a union -- though this still doesn't guarantee that you'll get to join. If you get lucky, you can land a gig with a great headshot and impressive résumé on a non-union project. But if you want to hit the big leagues and find work on a union project, then you have to obtain a production list from the union you've joined; this will contain all of the local union productions that are shooting near you; you will have to sent the stunt coordinator your headshot, résumé, and a brief letter, and hope to get picked for the job.  Even if you don't get picked, the coordinator will have your résumé on file for future gigs. While you're waiting for a call, you should try to get some more experience on (union-only) sets, to get a feel for what the job is like. You may not land your first gig right away. Or you may get lucky and land your first gig, and then there's the months-long radio silence before you hear from a producer again. That's perfectly natural. This is an extremely hard business to break in to, especially if you don't have any connections, and waiting is part of the game. Though you should continue to put yourself out there, you should be prepared to find other work in the meantime, and to stay motivated to succeed, even if you haven't gotten a gig in a while. Being a stunt man is exciting work, but you may not be able to do it forever, whether you're becoming prone to injury, getting older, or just no longer wanting to be part of a risky profession. If you're tired of being a stunt man or a stunt driver but you've gained a lot of experience, then you don't have to quit your field completely; instead, you can find a way to take a more management-related role while still staying in the stunt world. Here are some other roles you can take on:   Stunt rigger: To be a stunt rigger, you should not only be an experienced stunt performer, but you should have an understanding of the mechanics of stunt equipment. You should have safety as your first priority, and will perform a variety of tasks, from testing and tearing down stunt equipment on the set to arranging landing pads for falls and positioning wires and harnesses correctly.  Stunt coordinator: This is the head of the stunt department, the person who works closely with the director to create the action sequences in the film, or even to suggest alternative stunt scenarios when it is necessary. The stunt coordinator designs the desired stunts, hires the stunt crew, manages the budget, and makes sure all of the stunts are performed safely.  Second unit director: The person in charge of filming the stunt scenes, as opposed to the stunt coordinator, who is responsible for staging the actual stunts. As the second unit director, you will film scenes of the stunt performers in action as well as exterior shots of the scenes which can be used in post-production. Although these directors may have experience in stunt work, then must also be experienced in filming and directing."

      "Determining if Your Belt Needs Replacing",
      "Installing a New Alternator Belt",
      "Removing the Old Belt"
    ],
    "document": [
      "In older model vehicles, engines often came equipped with multiple belts that each powered a different accessory.  However, most modern vehicles use only one belt to power the alternator as well as the power steering, air conditioning, and any other accessories.  Depending on the make and model of the vehicle, this belt (often called the serpentine belt) is often located on the front or side of the engine.  Many American made vehicles with V6 engines or larger have the serpentine or accessory belts on the front.  These engines are considered “longitudinally mounted,” with the engine mounted lengthwise on the chassis. Many four cylinder vehicles have transverse mounted engines, meaning the engine is mounted at a ninety degree angle from the chassis, placing the belts on the side of the engine bay instead of the front. A significant sign that your alternator or serpentine belt needs replacing is visible cracking along the belt.  Modern serpentine belts are designed to prevent cracking and will last much longer than older accessory style belts, but all belts are prone to cracking over a long enough timeline.  If the belt appears dried out and cracks have formed, it will need to be replaced. Use a flashlight to get a good look at the belt in areas that aren't as visible to look for signs of cracking elsewhere on the belt. While cracks are the most common sign of a worn out belt, there are other common signs of damage that you should be on the lookout for.  Look for chunks of the belt missing in places, frayed fabric along the back of the belt, or signs that the belt has been rubbing on something.  You may want to start the engine to watch the belt moving to look for signs of damage along the entire belt. If something has been rubbing on the belt, you will need to identify it and move it before installing your new belt. Even with no visible signs of damage, your alternator or serpentine belt may still be too worn.  You can purchase an inexpensive plastic belt gauge at most auto parts stores than can tell you if your belt needs to be replaced by measuring the depth of the grooves on the belt.  Simply slide the gauge into one of the grooves and take note of how far it goes in.  If the plastic gauge seats into the belt far enough for the handle to make contact with the belt, it is too worn and will need to be replaced. You can do this test with the belt on or off of the vehicle. Instead of purchasing a belt depth gauge, you can purchase and download a smartphone application that can tell you if your belt needs to be replaced.  Applications like PIC gauge and Gates Programs Belt Wear allow you to simply take a picture of the belt threads to have the application analyze their depth.  If it deems the depth to be too shallow, it will tell you to replace the belt.  There are applications for both iPhone and Android smartphones that can measure the depth of the tread on your belts. It's important to remember that the application is not an expert opinion and may not always provide accurate information.",
      "Before you begin installing the new belt, compare it to the old one to ensure it is the proper length and width.  Different vehicles have different sized belts and installing the wrong size could result in failing to power the accessories or even damage to the engine.    If your old belt was loose because it had stretched over time, take that into consideration when comparing the two belts. Make sure both belts have the same number of “ribs” or threads spanning the width of the belt. Using a diagram or the picture you took to guide you, snake the new belt around all the necessary accessory pulleys except the auto-tensioner or alternator (depending on whether or not your vehicle came equipped with an auto-tensioner).  With many serpentine belts, this can be difficult, as some pulleys will be hard to access with your hands, so be patient and make sure to seat the belt properly around each.  You will need to keep tension on the belt with your hands as you slide it into place to ensure it doesn't fall off while you're looping it around pulleys. If your vehicle has a belt only for the alternator, you will need to only slide it around the crank pulley at the bottom of the engine. If your vehicle is equipped with an auto-tensioner, use a breaker bar or appropriately sized ratchet to lower the auto-tensioner pulley last.  With the belt around all of the other pulleys, slide it over the tensioner pulley with pressure still on the breaker bar or wrench.  Once the belt is in place, slowly reduce the pressure on the wrench, allowing the tensioner pulley to tighten the belt.  Do not simply release the auto-tensioner, as that could damage the belt and cause injury.  Instead, reduce the pressure you place on it slowly. Remove the wrench or breaker bar from the tensioner pulley once this is done. If you loosened the alternator to remove the old belt, reverse that process by sliding the belt back over the alternator pulley.  Again, take care not to place too much pressure on the loosened bolts of the alternator.  If the belt is too taught to slide it over the pulley, loosen the bolts a bit more to allow the alternator to tip forward further.  Try not to remove the bolts to the alternator completely, as they will be difficult to reinstall under the pressure of the belt. Make sure the belt seats on the alternator pulley completely. With the serpentine or alternator belt safely seated on the alternator pulley, use the same wrench you used to loosen to the bolts to tighten them again.  As you tighten the bolts, the alternator will stop tipping forward, which will increase the tension on the belt.  Don't tighten one bolt completely before moving to the next one.  Instead tighten one halfway, then the other, before coming back to the first. If the belt seems to be putting too much pressure on the alternator, check again to make sure you have it run through all the other pulleys properly. Once you have released the auto-tensioner or tightened the alternator bolts, check the tension of the belt to make sure it has seated properly on all pulleys.  Pinch the belt between your thumb and index finger and try to wiggle it.  There should be very little give to a properly installed alternator or serpentine belt.  You can purchase belt tension testers at many auto parts stores that will tell you for certain that the tension in your belt is sufficient. If the belt feels loose, check to make sure it has been run through all of the necessary pulleys properly. Once the belt is securely in place, slide the ground cable back onto the negative terminal on the battery.  Use the same wrench you used to remove it to tighten the bolt, then wiggle the connection with your fingers to ensure it is not loose.  Make sure the ground cable is tight and won't come off while driving. A loose or disconnected ground cable could cause the engine to die.",
      "Any time you work on your vehicle you should start by putting on the necessary safety equipment.  Eye protection will prevent dust, fluids or debris from falling into your eyes if you have to get under the vehicle.  Gloves can also provide protection against scratches, pinches and cuts that may result in working in your engine bay if you choose to wear them.  Always wear eye protection when working on your vehicle. Gloves can protect your hands, but are optional for this project. Open the hood of your car and locate the battery.  It's important to note that some vehicles keep the battery in the trunk instead of the engine bay for space saving or weight distribution.  Once you've located it, use a hand or socket wrench to loosen the bolt holding the ground cable to the negative terminal on the battery.  The negative terminal can be identified by looking for the negative symbol (-) or the letters NEG.  Loosen the bolt until you can slide the cable off of the terminal.  Tuck the cable to the side of the battery to prevent it from coming in contact with the negative terminal. This will ensure the engine cannot be started while you're working on it, protecting you and the engine from damage. Many newer model vehicles come equipped with an auto-tensioner pulley.  The pulley presses upward as the belt wraps around it so the belt remains under constant, steady tension.  Use a half inch drive breaker bar or socket wrench, and slide the portion of the wrench that would normally go into a socket into the square opening in the center of the pulley.  It is possible that your vehicle uses a 3/8 inch drive or even a bolt on the tensioner pulley, so refer to your particular vehicle's service manual to ensure you have the appropriate tools.  Rotate the wrench clockwise to relieve the pressure it is placing on the belt.    It may take a good amount of pressure to rotate the tensioner pulley down.  Be careful to release it slowly with steady pressure to avoid injuring yourself or damaging the vehicle. As soon as you let the tensioner go, it will return to its usual position and put pressure on the belt again, so you will need to hold it in place as you remove the belt. Not all vehicles are equipped with an auto-tensioner.  Consult your specific vehicle's service manual to see if yours is. If your vehicle does not have an auto-tensioner, you can still relieve the tension on the belt by loosening the bolts attaching the alternator to the engine.  As you loosen the bolts, tilt the alternator forward to create slack in the belt.  Be careful not to damage the threads of the alternator bolts by allowing it to sit tilted under pressure for too long.  If your vehicle has an alternator belt instead of a serpentine belt, this is the method you will need to use. Be careful not to damage the wiring going into the alternator.  The alternator provides the power the engine needs to run through those wires. Once the tension is off the belt, slide it off of the first or highest pulley.  Once it is off of one pulley, you can release the auto-tensioner if that is the method you used to reduce the tension.  Make a note of how the belt is wound throughout the different pulleys if it is a serpentine belt, as you will need to slide the new belt on in the same way.  If you do not have a diagram on the vehicle or in your service manual laying out the direction your serpentine belt travels through the pulleys, take a picture of it with your phone to refer to when installing the new belt. A strictly alternator belt will likely only go around an alternator pulley and the crank pulley at the bottom of the engine."

      "Whether you are in an abusive relationship or you just aren't happy with your partner anymore, there comes a time when you have to put your foot down and do what's best for you.  People stay in unhealthy relationships for many reasons, such as guilt, financial stress, or children. It's important to realize that you are actually trapping yourself in the relationship by focusing on these fears. You can start standing up for yourself in small ways by, for example, developing your own interests, making your own decisions, and spending more time away from your partner. Many people are reluctant to leave long-term relationships because they are not used to living alone and do not know what the future will hold for them if they leave. In order to start over as a single person, you need to be willing to take the plunge and accept that you don't know what will happen next.  If you're not quite ready to leave the relationship yet, try to focus on having compassion for yourself. If you consciously work on doing things that bring you more happiness, you will eventually develop the strength you need to leave a relationship that is holding you back. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't have the courage to leave the relationship right away. These negative thoughts towards yourself will only worsen your self-confidence, which will make it even harder to leave. Some people are actually happier being single, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you find that you don't have a problem with living alone and not having a partner, don't try to force yourself to do anything different. Even if you don't like being single, take this opportunity to find out what's really important to you in life.  It's easy for people to lose a bit of their identities in a relationship, so it may take some time to adjust to being on your own. Whether you plan on being single forever or just for a short period of time, learn to embrace your individual interests and preferences.  Take time to explore all of your interests. If you had a hobby before you were in a relationship that you no longer participate in, consider getting back into it. If not, try out some new hobbies until you find something you enjoy. There's no need to stick to routines that you created with a former partner. If you used to watch television every night from 8:00 until 10:00, think about whether there's something you would rather be doing now that you're single.",
      "If you were in a relationship for a long period of time, you probably relied on your partner to take care of at least some day-to-day tasks, whether it was mowing the lawn, cooking meals, or paying bills. As a single person, you need to be able to take care of all of these things on your own. Try making a list of all of the tasks your partner used to do for you, and learn how to tackle them one by one.  Being independent is incredibly empowering! Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, try to remind yourself that you are completely capable of taking care of yourself. Even if you choose to get involved in a relationship in the future, you will always know how to do things for yourself. Try not to get overwhelmed by everything you need to do, and don't be afraid to ask a friend, family member, or neighbor for some help if you don't know how to do something. Financial independence can be a huge hurdle if you previously depended on your partner's income. Take a careful look at your  budget and try to find areas where you can cut back. For example, you might be able to live in a smaller apartment as a single person, or you might learn how to  cook instead of eating out all the time. You can also consider getting a roommate. Just because you're single does not mean you are alone in the world. In fact, single people typically have stronger relationships with friends, family members, and neighbors than married people do. To avoid becoming lonely and isolated, surround yourself with the people you love.  Don't fall prey to the belief that you must have attachment problems if you are single. Studies have shown that single people are just as capable of forming healthy relationships with the people around them.  If you previously spent a lot of time with other couples, you might find that you are no longer invited to socialize with them now that you are single. They may be intentionally excluding you, or they may just be trying to avoid making you feel awkward. Either way, you need to decide if these former friends are important enough to you to have a talk with them about your relationship.  You might need to make some new friends if you are newly single. Try joining clubs, participating in volunteer work, or socializing with people from work. Having other single friends will make the transition much easier for you. Use sites like Meetup to find people who share your interests and make a few new friends. You may want to try joining singles groups or hanging out at singles bars, but be aware that you will probably encounter a lot of people who are looking for relationships, rather than trying to enjoy being single. There's a prevailing notion out there that people are only single because they can't find a partner, when in fact many people are single because they prefer living that way. If you are single for a long period of time, you will probably encounter people who think that there's something wrong with you. There's not much you can do to change society's view on relationships, so just try to ignore this kind of discrimination.  Research has shown that single people are no less happy, successful, or psychologically healthy than people who are in committed relationships. Take solace in this information, and remind yourself that people who believe otherwise are not well-informed.  If you experience this kind of discrimination from close friends or family members, it might be worth it to have a conversation with them about your choice to be single. If you can make them understand that you are happy being single and that you feel very hurt that they think badly of you for that, they may become more compassionate. If you're feeling lonely and isolated while single, these feelings may in fact be caused by discrimination, or \"single-shaming\" more than they are by the reality of your single life. This is why it's so important to stay away from people who make you feel bad about yourself for being single.  If people try to set you up, be very clear with them about whether or not you are interested. It's entirely up to you if you want to date or not at any particular time. You don't owe anyone an explanation.",
      "It's been shown that single people exercise more than married people. This may be because they have more free time or because they are more concerned about their appearances. Either way, take advantage of your single status to get healthy and enjoy life to the fullest. Because they rely more on themselves and have to deal with society's negative opinions about their relationship status, single people tend to be stronger and more resilient than couples. The next time you feel bad about not having a partner, remind yourself that you are a better person because of it. There's a tremendous amount of freedom that comes along with being single. If you were in a relationship for a long time, you may have forgotten how liberating it can be to make all of your own decisions, without having to worry about another person's opinion. Now that you are single, enjoy your freedom in these simple ways:  Travel when and where you want. Create a schedule that works for you. Decorate your apartment or house the way you like it. Eat the foods you like. Go out, stay in, or have people over as you prefer. Single people tend to value meaningful work more than people who are in relationships. If you want to be happy while single, it might help to commit more of your time to something you genuinely care about, whether it's your job or volunteer work.  Being single can make it much easier to truly commit yourself to your work because you don't have to worry about fulfilling the needs of your relationship. If you plan on being single for a long time, look for a job that gives you a sense of purpose and makes you want to get out of bed every single morning. If your life is already that fulfilling, being single won't feel like a void at all. Spending time alone can make you more creative and help you see the world from a different perspective. Take advantage of your alone time to pursue your creative passions, whether it's writing, painting, or just taking the time to admire the clouds in the sky.  Trying new things is one of the best ways to fend off loneliness when you're single. Take advantage of your ability to do whatever you want whenever you want and discover new interests and passions to keep your life exciting. Once you've learned how to survive when you are not in a relationship, you can decide if you would like to stay single or find a partner. Either choice is perfectly acceptable, so don't let others pressure you. Don't rush into a relationship that isn't right. The relationship should be reciprocal, and you shouldn't have to give up your personal identity."

      "What does your character do for the story? What type of personality will they have? Start sketching out their rough personality and general role. A clear personality (as opposed to \"does whatever\") gives your character a stronger presence in the story.  A list of adjectives (e.g. caring, perceptive, perfectionistic, anxious) is a good start, but it isn't nearly enough for a complex character. A strong character has a detailed history and present. One thing that interests readers is how a character deals with pain. What causes your character emotional pain? Do they suffer from an abusive family, bullying, regret over bad decisions, perfectionism, a mental illness, et cetera? What is your character afraid of? What upsets them?   Some beginners overload on tragedy, thinking \"more pathos means more interesting.\" However, too much can cause readers to lose interest. Focus on one or two things that hurt your character. One or two intense struggles are more compelling than 5 different problems. Try researching the problem(s) your character faces. For example, if your character is self-conscious about being deaf, read from Deaf people, their internal struggles, and how they learned to accept themselves. Do they hide their vulnerability, or share it? How do they cope on bad days? Consider which strategies (healthy or unhealthy) your character has developed to deal with hardship.   Who do they open up to? If it's hard to open up, why? What makes it scary to them? On a bad day, how does your character handle things? Be socially conscious when discussing harmful coping mechanisms. For example, your character might do harmful things, like excessive drinking or acting possessive/controlling to their partner. To avoid glorifying bad behavior, show the negative consequences of these. Your character should be held accountable for their actions. Consider the family and living situation your character had growing up, what problems they faced in childhood, and how this shaped who they are today. While the reader may not need to know all these details, it can help you understand your character as a person.  Example: Rosario grew up in a large family that spoke endlessly of \"hard work\" and \"pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.\" Determined to meet her parents' expectations, Rosario worked endlessly in school, but kept failing while her peers succeeded. Her teachers called her lazy, and she concluded she was broken. She was hospitalized at age 22 for burnout so severe it nearly killed her. Her subsequent ADHD diagnosis offered some relief, and an idea she wasn't defective. But she still struggles with feelings of inadequacy, and fears that no one will take her needs seriously, giving her difficulty opening up to others. A character built of only pain and weakness may end up feeling flat instead of compelling. To build a more rounded character, work on your character's strong points as well. Give them opportunities to shine.   \"Strengths\" are more than school- or job-related skills like \"math\" and \"fixing cars.\" Your character may also be compassionate, empathetic, good at problem-solving, a quick thinker, or other things that aren't tested at schools. Give your character opportunities to help others, or help progress the plot in positive ways. If your character falls into common stereotypes (greedy Jew, sexy Latina, burdensome disabled person), the lazy writing will make readers stop seeing the character as a three-dimensional person.   When writing diverse characters, read from people like your character. For example, if you're writing a Muslim character, read personal essays by Muslims about their lives, and articles on how (not to) write Muslims in fiction. Make your character unique. For example, black teens in poor urban areas are often stereotyped as \"thugs\" who get into trouble. But maybe your character has a passion for singing, and dreams of going into theater. Showing what makes them different helps build a strong story.  Try to surprise your readers by subverting their expectations of what the character \"should\" be. This can add layers of nuance and suspense to your story, especially if the secret is in danger of coming out, or the character is struggling with how to deal with the secret.   Emotions can be kept secret: fears, desires, et cetera. How does the character feel about the secret? How far will the character go to keep it from coming out?",
      "Now that you have your character template, work on keeping their story compelling as the plot moves forward. Your character should strive for something over the course of the story. Consider what the character wants, and how they try to achieve it. To make it even more interesting, make the stakes high.  Make it clear what the consequences of failure would be. For example, Tara is offered a morally questionable deal that would give her a lot of money. She balks initially, but then learns that her family is in financial trouble and may lose their house—the home that her dead mother raised her in. Tara needs money, or she will lose her childhood home forever. This goal pushes her to do things she otherwise wouldn't. They shouldn't just react to whatever is around them: they should try to take control of situations, strive towards their goals, and push the plot forward.  For example, say your character is in a convenience store when it is robbed. A passive character would wait for the robbers to leave or the police to come. A proactive one might help others hide or leave, or even try to stop the robbers. This makes for a more interesting story. Make your character work for what they want. Have their flaws (impulsivity, indecisiveness, failure to communicate, etc.) work against them. Readers like to see characters being pushed hard, and how those characters react to difficult situations. Make them confront their demons. Make them wonder if they'll fail. Depending on the character's role in the story, you may decide to have the character learn something. You need to (1) establish the character's flaw, (2) show the flaw hurting the character, and (3) show the character learning to move beyond the flaw. This shows character growth. Character arcs make a compelling part of a story. Example: Rayquan was bullied as a child, and learned to run and hide from the bullies. So he hides from problems, and he denies that they need to do anything about the villain in the story. Then the villain kidnaps his brother. Rayquan goes after his brother, learning to face problems head-on instead of only hiding. How does your character respond to others? Who do they value (and dislike)? What does this say about your character? An interesting character isn't necessarily alone: they interact with others in unique ways. This shows how your character (and their situation) is unique. Let your character test extremes and push limits. Show them doing things that different characters wouldn't do. This defines who they are and what they value. You, the writer, will come into the story knowing a lot about your character. The reader will know nothing. Let information be teased out over time. This lets them guess and wonder, motivating them to learn more and keep reading.  Example: In chapter 1, Ann is closed-off, brusque, and secretly kind. In chapter 3, she gets angry when asked about her family. In chapter 4, she talks about her fears about being a good mother, and is kind to a child. In chapter 6, she reveals her mother was abusive. In chapter 8, Ann's refusal to communicate nearly gets her killed when she storms off and is in a car accident with no one knowing how to find her. In chapter 9, she starts opening up more to her husband.",
      "Your character's appearance will be partially influenced by genetics, and partially by their personality. They will choose hair, piercings, clothes, and accessories.   For example, a shy girl might have long hair that hides her face, while a practical girl might prefer short hair that is easy to wash. Try doodling your character (even if you aren't good at art) to help you imagine them and how they might look. How much wisdom and experience do you want them to have? How old is your target audience? Exact age isn't important, but general stage of life (\"middle school,\" \"close to retirement age,\" \"just started first job\") matters. Many beginning writers pick overly obvious names, such as \"Brick Stronghelm\" for a tough character, or \"Raven Nightfall\" for a mysterious girl. This is as subtle as getting hit over the head with an anvil. Look for name meanings that are more subtle, and don't be afraid to be ordinary. After all, most people have ordinary names.   For example, the story \"Silent Voice\" features the main character \"Claire Fields.\" The story is about a girl developing her voice, so \"Claire\" suggests clarity. \"Fields\" is a common last name that involves peaceful nature imagery. Use baby name websites for ideas. Make sure that the names seem reasonable for the ethnicity. For example, \"Nazari\" would be a good last name for a Middle Eastern character, whereas \"Kimikho\" would be a weird first name for a white girl who lives in Montana."

      "One all-too-tempting and common little lie is in filling in extra details to make a story more entertaining. It can be tempting to make it a bear that wandered into your campsite, rather than a raccoon, but you might be setting a precedent that opens up reasons and opportunities for more lies. Let the truth be the truth and be as honest as possible. \" We've all been there, when someone asked something dreaded, like: \"Do I look fat in this?\" or \"Is Santa Claus real?\" Sometimes, we feel we must lie to make someone else feel better, or to lessen the blow or some uncomfortable truth, but the choice between being honest and lying isn't always a choice between A and B.   Emphasize the positive. Shift the focus away from what, in all honesty, you think is negative. Instead of saying \"No, I don't think you look good in those pants\" say \"They're not as flattering as the black dress—that dress really looks amazing on you. Have you tried it on with those stockings you wore to my cousin's wedding last year?\"  Keep some opinions to yourself. It might be true that you're not crazy about the cowboy-themed restaurant and bar that your best friend wants to visit on her only night in town, but it's not necessarily \"honest\" to share that opinion. What you want is to serve the greater good of the evening–you've only got one night together!–to keep fun moving forward. Instead of saying, \"I don't like this place. Let's go somewhere else,\" say \"Although it's not my favorite place, I want to do what you want to do. Let's make it awesome.\" Deflect the question. If your child wants to know if Santa Claus is real, tell them you're not sure, and engage them. Ask them what seems to be true for them: \"What do you think? What do kids say at school?\" You don't have to decide between a flat-out lie and the total truth. The real world is more complicated than that. If you're in a tense situation, in which getting honest would disrupt everyone's mood and happiness, it's not necessarily dishonest to remain silent. If you've got the option of staying out of it, stay out of it. It takes courage to stay silent in an awkward situation sometimes. Choose the high road. In a disagreement, more opinions don't make the issue easier to untangle, necessarily. You don't have to tell a white lie to get an argument to end, nor do you need to continue dropping truth-bombs. Stay out of petty disagreements entirely, rather than reigniting the flame.",
      "We've all lied at one time or another, to different people, to ourselves, and for different reasons. But coming up with a systematic plan for becoming more honest will be difficult unless you try to define those reasons and those people for yourself.   Lies to make ourselves look better might include exaggerations, embellishments, and flat-out tall-tales we tell to others, and ourselves, to make ourselves feel better about our inadequacies. When you're unhappy about something, it's much easier to fill it in with lies than tell the truth.   We lie to peers we think are better than us, because we want them to respect us as we respect them. Unfortunately, being dishonest is disrespectful in the long run. Give people more credit for their ability to empathize and understand you on a deeper level.  Lies that avoid embarrassment might include lies told to cover up bad behaviors, transgressions, or any activity we're not proud of. If your mom found a pack of cigarettes in your jacket, you might lie and say that they're your friend's to avoid punishment.  We lie to authoritative figures to avoid embarrassment and punishment, including ourselves. When we've done something we feel guilty about, lies are told to eliminate the guilt, avoid the punishments, and get back to the objectionable behavior we're forced to lie about. It's a vicious cycle. To break the chain of embarrassment and lying, it's important to learn to anticipate things that you'll likely feel guilty about in the future, and avoid those behaviors. When you lie, you're covering up some uncomfortable truth that's more easily couched in a lie. You can either get comfortable with the truth, or abandon the behavior that makes you embarrassed. If you smoke cigarettes, you won't have to lie if everyone knows it's true. Own up to it. If a behavior is un-own-upable, it's probably best to avoid it. It would be humiliating for your partner to find out that you had an inappropriate relationship with a coworker, but you won't have to lie if you don't do it. Sometimes we lie to make ourselves seem bigger and better than we really are. Because we're constantly competing and comparing ourselves to others, any inadequacies can be most-easily overcome with a quick and creative lie. If you stop feeling competitive with others and give yourself the value you deserve, you won't feel the need to lie to bring yourself up, because you're already up!  Forget what you think other people want to hear from you. Give other people the benefit of the doubt, and assume that they're not running \"game\" on you, or being manipulative. Speak from your heart and tell the truth, without even the slightest bit of concern about whether or not it will make you look \"bad.\" People respect honesty, even when the truth is uncomfortable. Let your honesty impress people, not your exaggeration. Lots of dishonesty results from attempts to impress our peers with elaborate tales that will one-up everyone else at the table. If you're unable to contribute to the round of anecdotes about European travel, just listen quietly and wait until the subject changes, instead of making up a ruse about your study-abroad in Majorca. Sometimes, it's better to own up to lies, to deceits, and to prior behaviors that you're embarrassed about, rather than continue weaving an elaborate web of lies. It can be liberating and extremely healthy to come clean. Even if there will be some consequences at the end of the admission, it'll be the honest consequences that you deserve. You don't have to lie if you feel good about yourself! Surround yourself with caring, understanding people who will respect you for who you are. Do things that give you pleasure and that make you feel proud of yourself. Getting super-drunk every night might make you feel good for a couple hours, giving you pleasure, but the ice-pick in your brain the next morning at work will have you feeling embarrassed and guilty when you can't make it into work. Take care of yourself, mentally and physically. Don't do things you're embarrassed to do. Be wary when someone tells you something in confidence that you know that you should share with someone else (e.g., knowledge of a crime, a lie, or a harmful act against another). Hearing such information puts you in a difficult position, especially when the truth eventually emerges and reveals to the affected person that you knew all along. If someone begins a sentence with \"Don't tell so-and-so about this, okay?\" be prepared to offer your own disclaimer: \"If it's something that I'd want to know about were I them, then please don't tell me. I don't want to be responsible for anyone's secrets but my own.\" Sometimes, we feel a burning urge in our guts to make ourselves be heard. Telling off a rude roommate, confronting your spouse, or arguing with a teacher can all seem like moments that require our complete and uncorked honesty, but pulling out the stopper can be a quick way to sour relationships and say things you don't actually mean. To avoid over-sharing, try to figure out the difference between things that you need to say because another person needs to hear it, and things that you want to say to make yourself feel better.   Someone else needs to know if they're missing something that will cause them physical or emotional harm, or if they're doing something that's affecting other people in the same way. Your roommate might need to know that their excessive drinking is making you uncomfortable in your own house, but not that you think a new date is \"trashy.\"  You might want to say something in a fit of anger or high emotion that, upon reflection, you might be able to couch in a more friendly way. In the middle of an argument about a lackluster relationship, you may want to say, \"You're gaining weight and now I'm not attracted to you,\" and this might be important for your spouse to hear in some ways, though not in others. However, \"I think we could be healthier\" puts the same sentiment in the language of something your spouse needs to know, in a much more polite way. . Everyone likes a straight-shooter, but sometimes a straight-shooter's aim can be off by a couple inches. Consider the effect of your words and learn to rephrase possibly-offensive or uncomfortable language. Learn to volunteer appropriate opinions  Use \"I\" statements when sharing uncomfortable truths. When you're sharing your opinions and truths with others, try to keep your honesty tamed. Focus on talking about your feelings, and your opinions, to stay respectful of others. Try to add the phrase \"In my experience...\" or \"Personally, I've observed that...\" at the beginning, or end it with \"...but that's just my observation/experience, that might not be how things are everywhere\". Learn to listen quietly while others are speaking, even if you disagree with what they're saying, or feel the need to dissent. When you take a turn to speak, they'll offer you the same courtesy, making the exchange both more honest and more comfortable.",
      "It's important to look in the proverbial mirror every now and then and take stock of how you feel. What do you like about yourself? What do you need to work on? It's possible to build up elaborate psychological barriers that force us into dishonest behaviors, opinions, and activities that could be avoided by giving ourselves an objective appraisal. Write down a list of your strengths and weaknesses in a notebook, not to take stock of your self-worth, but to find things to improve and to celebrate your achievements.  Identify your strengths. What are you good at? What do you do better than most people you know? What do you contribute to daily life? What are proud of? In what ways are you better than you once were? Identify your weaknesses. What embarrasses you about yourself? What could you do better? Have you gotten worse at something specific, over the years? A big source of dishonesty in our lives comes from an unwillingness to confront the things about ourselves that we're ashamed of, embarrassed about, or just plain disgusted by. Without dwelling on them, try to define them honestly.  Maybe you always hoped to have published that debut novel by the time you turned 30, a goal that's no closer now than it was 5 years ago. Maybe you know you need to get in shape, but find it easier to keep up the same old routine. Maybe your relationship is stale and you're unhappy in it, but can't bring yourself to make any considerable changes. As much as you can, try to eliminate excuses from your mind. It doesn't matter why this particularly uncomfortable truth about you is so, because you can't go back into the past to change it. You can, however, change your behavior now and start making yourself happier. From your list of strengths and weaknesses, try to identify specific areas for improvement, and specific ways that you might improve yourself.  What was necessary for your strengths to become strengths? What did you do that you're especially proud of? In what way could that truth inform your desire to improve some of your weaknesses? What threatens your ability to improve yourself? Are these threats external, like a lack of funds necessary to buy a gym membership and lose a few pounds, or internal, like a lack of desire to research DIY weight-loss options? When you decide to act, carry through with your decision. Lying to yourself is easy. It's easy to come up with a couple hundred reasons not to do something you don't want to do. That's why we let it happen so often! Make it hard on yourself. When you decide to end a relationship, or start working, start doing it. Make it happen. Now. Don't wait until you come up with a litany of reasons that it's \"not the right time.\" When you make a decision, set it in motion.  Make it easy on yourself to be successful in accomplishing your improvements. Set up a risk-and-reward exchange when you accomplish a daunting task, like buying yourself that new guitar after ending your ugly relationship, or treating yourself to a vacation after losing a couple pounds. Accomplish your tasks with digital aid: you can sign up with Skinny-Text to receive exercise reminders on your phone, or even consider using Pact, which will charge you a specific amount of money if you choose not to exercise."

      "These pests love stagnant water because they thrive in it. You should remove or cover any objects or areas that offer this amenity.  Cover your garbage cans and recyclables container. Don’t leave glasses of water lying around for long periods of time. Make sure water is not stagnating in your sink or bathtub. Ants are repelled by the smell of vinegar, so spray or flick some white vinegar around your window and door frames to keep them from marching in. Also, try to clean up after you eat: soiled napkins, crumbs, and unwashed dishes are alluring to ants. Fruit flies love sweet things, they can’t help themselves. So give them what they want: a small bowl or cup of white wine will lead them to dive in for a taste – and never return! Moths thrive in humid conditions. One way of making it inhospitable for them in one of their common feasting grounds is to hang a stick of chalk in your clothes closet. This will dry out your closet and keep moths away. Roaches like to eat many things. One thing they absolutely can’t stand, however, is cucumber peelings (go figure). So next time you peel a cucumber, don’t throw the peelings away but instead leave them lying around your kitchen counter or bathtub to keep roaches from venturing out into your home. If you find your cucumber peels are attracting ants, you can always use Borax: sprinkle somewhere there is high roach traffic and you should see their population drop in about a month. Contrary to popular belief, Borax is only mildly toxic to humans and pets. Spiders seem to pop up without reason, but, aside from you targeting their insect prey, there are ways to keep them at bay inside your home. Here are some ideas:  Seal any spaces that lead outside, such as the sealing around your windows and doors.  Trap unwanted spiders by placing glue boards in garbage cans, basements, kitchens, and bathrooms.  If your spider problem is overwhelming, you might need to spray spider insecticide or call a team of professionals. Crickets are a popular food source for geckos, so curtailing their population outside (and inside!) your home is a good idea to deter geckos from coming around.  A shallow bowl filled with molasses (or beer) diluted with water will eliminate crickets inside and outside your home: they’ll jump right in!  Keep your grass cut short in your yard because crickets thrive in tall grass.",
      "Geckos like warmth, water, and places to hide. You can do several things to make sure your home doesn’t offer these amenities.  Maintain the general cleanliness of your home by keeping the floor swept and not leaving piles of stuff lying around, such as laundry, newspapers, boxes, etc.  Keep your furniture six inches from the walls and don’t hang up many pictures: geckos are nocturnal and like warm, dark places to hide out during the day.  Keep your thermostat turned down as low as you can handle: geckos like the warmth and humidity of your home when it gets cool at night.  If you have any leaky faucets or pipes or any area that generally offers stagnant water in a humid environment – fix them and remove the water because geckos are drawn to those environments. Your backyard can be a welcome mat to your home if geckos are drawn there by their creature comforts: water, insects, and cover. Here are some guidelines to follow in order to make your yard less welcoming:  Remove any places where water can stagnate, such as birdbaths, as these are the breeding grounds for insects geckos prey upon and sources of hydration to geckos.  Water your yard sparingly, as lizards enjoy the moist environment and will drink the water for hydration.  Do not plant succulents: if a gecko cannot find any water for hydration, it will nibble on succulents to survive.  Trim back your bushes, especially those close to your house, because geckos love places to hide.  Placing some netting over your shrubs will keep geckos from using them as hideouts.  Use outdoor lighting sparingly, as it draws insects that geckos prey upon. If you must use outdoor lighting, consider sodium vapor or yellow lights. Geckos can squeeze their little scaly bodies into small crevices and holes, so make sure your home is well sealed. Walk around the inside and outside of your home and fill any cracks with caulk and make sure your windows and venting are screened properly.",
      "This is a very effective and inexpensive way to scare away geckos: they see eggshells and they think “predator.” Leave two eggshell halves around your home, such as at outdoor entryways, or in the kitchen.  Do not crush the eggshells, leave them in two halves. One two-halves pair at every entrance should be enough: the geckos just need to run into it, then they'll run away from it. To keep the eggshells fresh, change them every 3 to 4 weeks. Mothballs target moths, cockroaches, ants, flies – and geckos! A real household panacea! Leave some under the stove, refrigerator, or sink to repel geckos. Many of the insects that geckos eat are drawn to light, so, oftentimes, geckos will hang out in those areas. Placing some flypaper near light sources will not only catch geckos’ pesky food source, but will likely catch the geckos themselves.  A good position to place the flypaper is on the inside of the light bulb’s shade/housing. You can also set glue boards or sticky cards near windows or other outdoor entryways. If you find a live gecko stuck in one of your sticky traps, you can unstick it and set it free by pouring vegetable oil over the trap. It’s nasty – but humane! Using moist coffee grounds and some tobacco powder, form a small ball with your hands and stick it on the end of a toothpick. Put this near where the geckos are nesting or where they might easily find it, like an outdoor entryway. The geckos will consume some of this ball and die. Garlic’s strong odor isn’t just repellent to some humans, it’s also repellent to geckos, too! Leave a garlic clove around an outdoor entryway to keep them from entering that way ever again. Onion slices are another irritant that will drive geckos away. Cut an onion in half and leave it in a known gecko hiding place, somewhere warm and cozy that you’ve seen a gecko camping out, or by an outdoor entryway. The irritation felt by humans when sprayed by pepper-spray is not unlike that felt by geckos that encounter it. Mix some pepper and water in a spray bottle and spray the solution around your home in places like under the refrigerator, behind the couch, or on the walls – basically, anywhere warm or anywhere you’ve seen a gecko.  Cayenne pepper or chili powder can be used in place of pepper.  Tabasco sauce can be used in place of the home-made pepper-spray.  Warning: spraying too much may repel ‘’you’’ from your home, so be mindful of its irritating effect. If you have a stubborn gecko that just refuses to be repelled from your home, you can try capturing him manually, as it were, by setting a box against a wall and “encouraging” the gecko to get inside. Then you can release it back into the wild – and set some more repellents to keep it out!"

      "Analyzing a Piece of Music"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Though you may not have the most beautiful singing voice in the world, singing will help to improve your ear.  Your voice forms an important line between your instrument and the music you hear in your mind. If you can sing the intervals and chords of the song accurately, you will have an easier time identifying and playing them by ear. If you aren’t used to singing out loud, record yourself as you play a note on your instrument and then try to match your voice to it. Slide up or down on the scale until you can locate the note with your singing voice. Continue to do this with several other notes. Try to match the pitch of the note in your mind before singing it out loud. Don’t worry about notes that are too low or too high for you to sing well. Test your ear training by playing a note and then trying to sing it correctly. String several notes or sections of the song together and then try to play and sing it at the same time as one consistent melody. You can do this exercise alone or with a teacher or peer.  Your teacher or peer will play a section of the song. You can also record yourself playing a section of the song. You will then repeat the section of the song by listening to the person play or the recording of your playing. Your teacher will listen to your response and give you feedback to improve your playing. Keep doing call and response until you can play a section or sections of the song. Playing around or “noodling” on your instrument allows you to find sounds and patterns you like, especially when you’re just starting to learn how to play your instrument.  This will allow you to build an alphabet of fingering sequences, which are the building blocks of musical phrases and melodies. After enough “noodling”, you may be able to link together several fingering sequences and locate a tone you want to play in a sequence. While most music teachers may disapprove of playing around on your instrument, it is a great way to become familiar with tones and chords by ear, which you can then also recognize in popular songs and try to learn based on what your ear recognizes.",
      "A strong melody will be easier to learn to play by ear.  Rock or folk songs usually have strong, easy to recognize melodies. Avoid songs with inconsistent melodies, such as rap and hip hop tracks. In music, notes combine in a specific way to make a scale or chord, and chords come together to form chord progressions. Chord progression patterns are especially common in popular music, so you should be able to recognize common patterns when you hear them.  Recognizing chord progression patterns will help you to anticipate chord changes as you listen to a piece of music. For example, popular songs like ‘La Bamba’ and ‘Twist and Shout’ share one of the most common chord progressions of all time. If you can play the chords for one of these songs, you can easily play other songs with the same or similar chord progression. This will help you find the key of the song.  To find the key of the song, you must first find the tonic or the root note, which is the first and last note in the scale of the song.  For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic is C. The notes in a scale or key are like a family, so they are related and center around the tonic of the key. The tonic or the root note of the song will be the tone that sounds the most ‘at home’ in the song. It will sound like it could fit just about anywhere in the song. Now that you’ve found the key of the song, try to find the melody based on the notes in the key. For example, in the key of C, the notes are C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C, so the melody will fall within these notes. In general, the notes of scales and chords are assigned specific numbers. So, the fifth is a fifth note of the scale.  If we use ‘La Bamba’ as an example, it is in the key of C major. So, G is the fifth degree of C Major, as you go five degrees up from C Major, i.e. C,D,E,F,G, A,B,C.  It’s best to play a fifth above the tonic as the fifth is always the second most stable tone in any key. This tone should also feel like it could belong in any part of the song, though not as strongly as the tonic. Focus on finding the root note for each of the chords, and then determine the fifth.  For example, the root of the next chord in ‘La Bamba’ is F. To determine the fifth of the F chord, count five degrees up from F and this gives us C, i.e. C, D,E,F,G,A,B,C.  Continue the same process for the next chord. Focus on playing each chord in sequence along with a recording of the song. This will help you determine if you are playing the right chords. If a chord sounds off, go back and try to adjust it based on your ear."

To access the thoracic cavity, use a sharp knife to cut through the muscle (diaphragm) and membrane that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity.  Expect to find a lot of blood when you cut into the thoracic cavity. Be careful when working in the thoracic cavity. If the deer was shot in the chest there may be sharp broken ribs.

      "The digestive tract, is the continuous tube through which food travels, and consists of the esophagus, the stomach, the intestines and the rectum. The digestive tract is best removed in one piece. To remove the digestive tract in one piece, you will need to free both ends. To free the top end or esophagus (swallowing tube leading to the stomach), reach up into the chest cavity as far as you can and sever the esophagus. Then pull this end down, through the chest and out. Next you need to free the lower end of the digestive tract or rectum/anus. To do this cut a deep ring around a buck's anus, or a deep ring around a doe's anus and vagina. Stuff the now freed rectum back into the body cavity, and out through the stomach incision. The cut around the anus should circumscribe the anus but not cut the anus. The goal is to free the anus from the surrounding tissue, while leaving the digestive tract, including rectum, intact. Your cut around the anus should be about 4 inches (10.2 cm) deep. Now that both ends of the digestive tract are free you can roll the intact digestive tract out of the body cavity. As you handle the digestive tract, be careful not to cut the intestines, or squeeze fecal matter out. Spilled fecal matter will taint the meat. You may choose to tie off the rectum to minimize spillage.",

Use a sharp knife to make an incision down the belly, from just below its sternum to its genitals. Your incision should be deep enough to cut the hide and the  peritoneum (the thin membrane found just below the skin and over the organs). But be careful to not cut too deep. If you cut too deep you may puncture the organs and taint the meat. After the initial incision near the sternum, make the rest of the cut with the knife blade facing up. This helps prolong the blade's life (as it is not cutting through the fur) and minimizes the chances of you accidentally puncturing an organ. Use a small sharp knife to free the abdominal organs from any membranous adhesions. Once cut free, use your hands to remove the bladder, kidneys, liver, spleen, pancreas, and internal genitalia.  When removing the bladder be careful that you do not spill any contents. To prevent any urine spilling, pinch off the bladder with one hand and slowly cut it free and remove the bladder with the other hand. Take special care to not accidentally cut the intestines or the spleen, as their spilled contents will ruin meat."

      "This method cuts off your posts after 50 characters. This method might be good enough if you mostly post links or photos. If you want to share written posts, try a different method instead. This method is also much easier if you have access to a computer, although it can be done on a mobile device with some workarounds. You can do this from a mobile phone, a tablet, or a computer. If you can't find the options described below using a mobile Facebook app, try logging in on your mobile browser instead, at http://m.facebook.com Click the small, downward arrow in the top right of any Facebook page. Select Settings from the drop-down menu. Access your Mobile settings by clicking the link on the left-hand column of the settings page. In order to use this method, you'll need to associate a mobile phone number with your Facebook account, and that phone must have texting enabled. Don't worry: instructions are included below that will keep your number private and spam-free, if that's what you want. First, follow these steps to enable a phone:  Click +Add a Phone. A window should open called \"Activate Facebook Texts.\" Choose your region and mobile carrier from the drop down menu, then click Next. Text the letter F to the number 32665 from the phone you want to add. While waiting for a reply, you can decide whether to uncheck the options that share your phone number and allow Facebook friends to text you. When you receives a text reply, enter the confirmation code listed into the window, then click Next. The Mobile settings page should now have several options listed, with a \"post-by-email address\" displayed near the bottom of the page. This is a meaningless string of letters and numbers ending with \"@m.facebook.com.\" Copy-paste it into another document, or write it down. It sometimes takes about 20 minutes for the address to show up. Try refreshing your page if it doesn't show up within a few minutes. By default, the phone you linked to your Facebook account can receive Facebook messages as texts. To change this, change the new Mobile settings to \"Never text me\" and/or \"maximum 1 text per day.\" If you are on a mobile device, skip to the next step instead. If you do have access to a computer, log in to your Google+ account. After logging in, click Your circles near the top of the page, underneath the search bar. Once you're taken to a new page, click the large +. Name the circle \"Facebook Posting\" and add your Facebook post-by-email address as a new contact. Sharing with this circle should post to your Facebook account as well! You only need to follow this step if you could not follow the previous step. Most mobile devices will not allow you to type in new email addresses, so this gets a little roundabout:  Log in to the Google+ app, then touch the icon in the top right and select Settings. Make a note of which email address is linked to your account, or press Add account if you don't have one. (Gmail accounts may make this more reliable.) Log in to that email account on your mobile browser. Make a new contact called \"Facebook Posting,\" entering the special Facebook post-by-email address you found above. Return to the main page of the Google+ app. Select the \"people\" icon on the top right (two silhouetted faces). Select See more people and pages at the bottom of the page. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page, then press Create a new circle. Name this circle \"Facebook Posting\" and press OK. Scroll through your circles to find the \"Facebook Posting\" circle. Press one of the blue people icons, then Find people to add. Once again, select See more people and pages at the bottom of the page. Scroll down to your \"Email contacts\" section and press View all. Scroll through these and select the \"Facebook Posting\" contact. Add this to your \"Facebook Posting\" Circle. Now every time you share with that circle, your post will be shared with Facebook as well. (If you do not see this contact, you may need to wait for your Google+ app to sync with your email.)"

      "While all UC sufferers must cope with sensitivity to certain foods, the specific sources of your sensitivity can greatly vary.  As a result, there is no one “UC diet.”  Keep track of the foods you eat and how they make you feel.  Use this information to develop the diet that works best for you.  Try to eat a balanced diet whenever possible.  If you find yourself unable to consume certain types of foods, consult your doctor about vitamin supplements to help you replace key nutrients. Note any preparation tweaks that make foods easier to consume – steaming vegetables, for example, or consuming low- or non-fat dairy products. Many UC patients experience relief during flare-ups when they maintain a diet that produces less “residue,” or leftover waste.  Essentially, following a “low residue” diet means you’ll have smaller and fewer bowel movements, and consequently less diarrhea, cramping, and pain.  Bear in mind that if you can handle higher “residue” foods such as whole grains, you should eat them.  When you’re struggling with your UC symptoms, however, try:  Grain products including refined white bread; plain crackers; Melba toast; cooked cereals such as cream of wheat, farina, or grits; cold cereals such as corn flakes or puffed rice; white rice; noodles; and refined pasta. Soft fruits with any skin or seeds removed, including bananas, soft cantaloupe, honeydew, canned or cooked fruit, and avocado. Well-cooked fresh or canned vegetables without seeds, including asparagus tips, beets, green beans, carrots, mushrooms, spinach, squash (remove seeds), pumpkin, and tomato sauce. Potatoes without skins. Milk products in moderation, as long as you are not lactose intolerant. All meat, as long as the cuts are tender, soft, and lean.  Eggs are also okay. Many condiments, including butter, vegetable oil, ketchup, mayonnaise, sour cream, smooth sauces, soy sauce, clear jelly, honey, and syrup. Decaffeinated coffee or tea, decaffeinated carbonated beverages, milk, strained vegetable juices, and fruit juices made without seeds or pulp such as apple juice. Drink plenty of fluids each day.  Water is best.  Alcohol and beverages containing caffeine stimulate your intestines, which will increase your discomfort.  While carbonated drinks are allowed under a “low residue” diet, they can often produce gas – an uncomfortable addition to your already-problematic symptoms. Plan to carry a bottle of water with you to make it easy to stay well hydrated. Your body may find it easier to digest small amounts of food throughout the day rather than coping with three larger meals.  When developing a diet plan, think about snacks that you can easily take along when you’re out and about. Seeds, nuts, and coconut; whole-grain products; raw or dried fruits; raw vegetables; beans, lentils, and tofu; tough or cured meats; crunchy peanut butter; chunky jams or marmalades; pickles and other preserved foods; pop corn; and fruit juices containing pulp or seeds may all cause problems for UC sufferers.  Note that many of these foods are exceptionally healthy under other circumstances.  Again, experimentation is key.  If you find you can tolerate some of these foods, you should certainly continue eating them.  Eliminate ones that cause you distress. While dairy products contain no fiber, many UC patients also suffer symptoms of lactose intolerance.  Your food diary should help you determine whether you are able to tolerate dairy products.",
      "Studies have found that the curcumin in turmeric, a spice often used in curry, has anti-inflammatory properties.  While more research is needed, one study found that patients who consumed foods containing turmeric reduced their symptoms and their need for other medications.  Many curries containing turmeric can be quite spicy; use care to avoid irritating the lining of your colon. People with gallbladder disease, gastrointestinal reflux, hormone-related cancers, or those on blood-thinning medication should not consume turmeric. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil may reduce UC symptoms and flare-ups.  Some studies indicate that fish oil in combination with medications such as sulfasalazine can be effective.  Note that study results are mixed, and that sometimes fish oil may actually cause diarrhea. Refrain from taking fish oil if you are currently on blood-thinning medication. Our intestines contain good bacteria that keep bad bacteria from causing problems.  Frequent diarrhea reduces the population of good bacteria.  Foods such as yogurt contain “live cultures,” or probiotics – good bacteria – that can repopulate your intestines, reducing UC symptoms. Many people who have UC also have low levels of folic acid in their bodies.  Common UC medications can exacerbate this problem.  Consuming adequate folic acid helps counter UC patients’ increased risk of developing colon cancer. Note that folic acid can camouflage a vitamin B12 deficiency.  Consult your doctor about a dietary regimen that will allow you to consume adequate quantities of both nutrients. Some research suggests supplements or enemas containing this substance can improve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.  More studies are needed to determine whether glucosamine is useful in treating UC. As with many treatments, N-acetyl glucosamine can negatively interact with blood-thinning medications. UC patients have found relief using a variety of herbal treatments.  Consult a trained health care provider to determine which varieties would be best for your system.   Note that many of these herbs interact with other medications.  Psyllium seeds may help lengthen periods of remission when taken in combination with other medication.  This insoluble fiber may exacerbate symptoms during flare-ups, so be sure to talk with your doctor before taking it.  Some UC patients may do better with soluble fiber such as flax seed or oat bran. Boswellia has anti-inflammatory properties, and some studies indicate it can work about as well as the prescription medication sulfasalazine. Slippery elm is a demulcent, which means it can protect irritated tissues and promote their healing, but should never be taken by pregnant women. Marshmallow is also a demulcent.  Avoid marshmallow if you are diabetic or take other medications, including lithium. Chamomile is often brewed as a tea to soothe the digestive tract.  Avoid chamomile if you have a ragweed allergy.  This herb can also have estrogenic properties, so use caution if you have any history of hormone-related disease. Some studies have shown acupuncture can produce relief from UC symptoms.  Acupuncture also works as a stress reliever, magnifying its useful qualities for UC patients.",
      "While scientists do not understand what causes UC, this disease appears to have a genetic disposition that may be triggered by factors in our environment.  Think of UC as being like hay fever.  If you have hay fever, you have a genetic disposition that will cause you to develop itchy eyes and a runny nose if exposed to pollen.  If you’re never exposed to pollen, you’ll never develop the symptoms.  If you are, you will.  You certainly didn’t cause the pollen, or the genetic disposition!  The same principle applies to UC. Some people will go months or even years without suffering any symptoms of UC.  Proper treatment will extend these periods of remission.  Only five to 10 percent of UC patients experience UC symptoms all the time, and fortunately even acute sufferers have treatment options. You’ll likely spend most of your life in remission.  Properly treated, this is not a life-threatening illness.  You can expect to enjoy relationships, marriage, children, a career, and other joys of life.",
      "Stress does not cause UC, nor does it increase the inflammation that produces your symptoms.  Stress does, however, impact your digestive system in other ways.  If you are already suffering from diarrhea associated with UC, you’ll want to avoid the additional bowel movements that stress can produce!   Reduce your stress levels with meditation or pursue other relaxation and breathing techniques.  Take a few moments during the day to close your eyes and focus on something peaceful and relaxing. This will help to relieve stress and calm your bowels. Use a biofeedback machine to reduce muscle tension, slow your heart rate, and decrease your stress. Take up yoga or tai chi. Even mild exercise will reduce your stress levels, relieve depression, and help improve your bowel function.  Consult your doctor to develop an exercise program that is right for you. While hydration during exercise is important for everyone, if you have UC it is especially important to consume adequate water before and during exercise. Chronic diseases can be difficult to cope with because they are life-long conditions.  Not everyone is interested in becoming an advocate, and if you’d prefer to deal with your illness in private that is perfectly fine.  Some UC patients find strength and comfort in working to educate others, support fellow UC sufferers and raise money for UC research.  If you believe you would benefit from such activities, research the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation or other advocacy organizations.",
      "These drugs are usually the first step in treating UC and other inflammatory bowel diseases.  Aminosalicylates such as as sulfasalazine can effectively reduce UC symptoms.  This medication can produce a variety of side effects, including digestive distress and headaches.  Other medications in this family include mesalamine, balsalazide, and olsalazine.  These medications are available in oral and enema or suppository forms. Cortisteroids, including prednisone and hydrocortisone, are generally used when moderate to severe UC does not respond to other treatments.  They are delivered orally, intravenously, or via enema or suppository.  Steroids can produce many side effects, so they are not usually a long-term treatment. These drugs reduce inflammation too, but they do so by targeting the immune response that produces the inflammation.  Sometimes they are used in combination with a cortisteroid.  Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are the immune system suppressors most commonly prescribed to UC patients. Infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are “biologics,” or immune system suppressors that operate by neutralizing a protein that your immune system produces.  These medications are generally prescribed to moderate or severe UC sufferers. Vedolizumab was recently approved for patients who have not responded to other types of immunosuppressant drugs. Always talk with your doctor before beginning a new medication regimen.  Doctors will often recommend one or more of the following in addition to prescription medication:  Antibiotics, especially when a flare-up is causing you to run a fever. Anti-diarrheal medications, especially if your diarrhea has become severe. Acetaminophen for mild pain relief.  Note that ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and diclofenac sodium can all worsen UC symptoms and should therefore be avoided. Iron supplements to combat anemia, especially if you are experiencing bleeding. Between 20 and 30 percent of people with UC will eventually need to undergo a colectomy (removal of colon) or proctocolectomy (removal of colon and rectum) due to massive bleeding, severe illness, rupture of the colon, or cancer risk.  Surgery does usually eliminate the disease altogether.  Your surgeon will create an internal pouch from a portion of your small intestine that empties into your anus, allowing you to expel waste relatively normally. Note that sometimes it is not possible to construct an internal pouch.  If this is the case, your surgeon will create a permanent opening in your abdomen (a colostomy), through which stool is collected in an attached bag. UC does increase your risk of colon cancer, so it is important to go in for a surveillance colonoscopy every one to two years."

      "if you’ve never met the person before. If you want to talk to a stranger, approach them, make eye contact, and smile. Say hello and tell them your name so they feel comfortable around you. Offer a handshake so the other person feels connected to you and more willing to talk. Ask them for their name so you have a natural lead-in to a longer conversation.  For example, you may say, “Hi, my name is John. It’s nice to meet you.” You don’t need to introduce yourself if you just want to have a casual conversation, but it will help make people more receptive to you. Mentioning something negative at the start of your conversation may make others unwilling to open up and talk with you. Bring up something around you that you really enjoy and smile while you’re talking to the other person is more likely to open up and talk with you. After you mention what you enjoy, you ask them how they feel about it to get them involved. For example, if you’re at a party, you may say, “This music is really cool! Do you like it?” or, “Have you tried the food yet? It’s really delicious.” Ending with a question encourages the other person to respond and start a conversation. Talk about the person’s personality or something they’re wearing when you give a compliment. Be genuine with your compliment or else the person may feel like you aren’t being truthful and deter them from talking to you. Follow up with a question to keep the conversation going, or else they may not respond.  You may say something like, “That dress looks really nice. Where did you get it?” or, “You have a good sense of style. How do you find outfits to wear?” Use open-ended questions as much as you can so the conversation doesn’t end with “yes” or “no.” Avoid bringing up someone’s appearance since it could make them uncomfortable and they may not respond well to it. If you’re unable to think of a way to transition into a conversation, look around where you and make an observation about something you see. It can be about the weather, a venue, other people, or an event taking place. Stay positive in your conversation so you seem inviting to the other person and you make them more interested in talking to you.  For example, you may say, “This is my first time at this cafe. Have you tried anything here?” or, “I wish the sun would come out today. When’s the last time it wasn’t cloudy.” Have a sense of humor when you’re having your conversation. It will make others feel engaged and make your chat more enjoyable.",
      "to the other person actively so you can respond to the other person. Put away your phone and focus your attention on the other person while they’re talking. Maintain eye contact with them so they know that you’re paying attention to them and actively listen to what they’re saying. Ask them questions based on what they say so to stay involved in the conversation.  When they end their thought, briefly restate something they said so they know you were paying attention to them. For example, if they mentioned getting a new vehicle, you can ask, “What kind of car did you end up getting? Does it drive well?” Try to avoid thinking of other things while the other person is talking since you may not respond naturally to them when they finish. If the other person mentions something that you can relate to while they’re talking, use the phrase, “That reminds of…” before talking about your topic. This way, you can easily go between multiple topics in a natural way without any awkward breaks in the conversation. Make sure the topics are related in some way to make it a smooth transition so it’s easier for the other person to follow along. For example, if they mention the nice weather, you may say something like, “That reminds me of the gorgeous weather in Hawaii when I visited. Have you been there?” If you have something come into your head during a random break in the conversation, bring it up and ask the other person about it. Don’t interrupt the other person if you think of something while they’re talking since it’s rude. Make sure the topic isn’t something that would make the other person uncomfortable, or else they may not want to continue talking.   For example, you may say, “I just remembered a funny news story I found online. Do you want to hear it?” The person may not be as receptive of a random topic if you haven’t already talked to them yet.",
      "Reach out to the person you want to talk to and mention work or school. Ask them what their job involves, how long they’ve been there, and ask if they’ve done anything interesting lately. If they’re still in school, ask them what they’re studying and what they hope to do when they graduate.  Be sure to answer any questions if they ask about your job or education as well. Show genuine interest in their job, even if it doesn’t sound the most exciting to you. Use it as an opportunity to learn more about the person and the subject. People enjoy talking about things they’re passionate about, so ask the person what they like to do outside of work or school, and note any areas that sound interesting to you. See what their favorite thing about the hobby is and what they like about it. When they ask you about your hobbies, mention any that are similar to theirs first so you can hold a conversation about it. If you’re interested in one of their hobbies, ask them how to get involved so you can try it too.  For example, you may say something like, “Oh I’ve never tried woodworking. What’s the best thing to do for a beginner.” Make sure you don’t talk over the other person or talk only about your hobbies. Ask questions about what the other person enjoys so you can have a good back-and-forth dialogue. Many people share similar tastes in media, so talk about recent films or music that you’ve seen or listened to and gauge the other person’s interest. Ask them what content they’ve been enjoying lately and let them explain why they like it. If you both have seen or heard the same thing, have a discussion about it and talk about your opinions to keep the conversation going.  For example, you could say, “Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie? What did you think of the ending?” or, “What music do you like to listen to? Do you have a favorite artist I should check out?” Even if you disagree with their opinions, stay positive and say something like, “Oh, I never thought of it that way, but I understand your point.” That way, the other person will still feel engaged with the subject rather than being shot down. If you don’t know what the other person is talking about, ask them to clarify or explain what happens so you can get a better understanding of it. It’s okay to say “I don’t know,” if you’re unfamiliar with media they’re discussing. If you feel comfortable with the other person, you may ask about their past or what they want to do in the future. Ask them about funny things that happened to them, what their family is like, or goals they have. Open up about your own experiences so you can share them and connect with the other person.  For example, you may say something like, “Where are you originally from? Did you like it there?” or, “What did you want to be when you grew up?” Strangers may find it odd if you ask too much about their personal life right when you meet them. Only ask deeper questions if you both feel comfortable responding to them. Never try to “one-up” the person or try to impress them, since it may make them uncomfortable and want to leave the conversation. Look up current events in the news or on social media and mention them to the other person.

      "Some items may need steaming, such as rice or carrots. Some items may need to be dried or toasted, such as quinoa or oats. Sugar and butter may need to be melted. The ingredients should be mixed evenly.  When making a soft, chewy bar you will be adding items to a thick batter. As such, you will need to make sure the particles are suspended evenly so that they do not fall to the bottom of your bars. If the inclusions you have chosen are too heavy, try smaller pieces. Alternatively, try drying them out. For example, walnuts may need to be chopped into small pieces as well as slightly dried to ensure they stay suspended in your mixture. Most bars need to be baked to keep everything together and to ensure that all the raw starches are properly cooked.  The mixture should be spread into a baking pan at the desired thickness. Setting your oven to a temperature of 350 °F (177 °C) should be sufficient. Bake times will vary depending on the type of bar you are preparing. For thick batters, use a toothpick to check the bars are cooked adequately. Stick the toothpick in the middle; when the toothpick is removed and contains no raw batter, the bars are done. For other bars, bake until desired level of crunchy or chewy. Some bars can be made quickly and don’t require baking, but do need refrigeration; these are the bars that have no raw flour in them. An example would be a peanut butter and granola bar.",
      "The snack bar may contain different components depending on when it is going to be consumed. The ingredients of a bar made for breakfast would typically differ from a bar made for post workout consumption. That doesn’t mean you can’t eat your snack bar anytime of the day; it just helps you supplement your diet with what is nutritionally required when you only have time for a meal replacement.  For a breakfast bar, you should aim to include protein, carbohydrates, fruit or veggies and some good fat into it. The bar should be large enough that when eaten with a glass of milk, you feel satiated. One and a half to 2.5 oz. (42 to 70 g) is a good starting point for the size of the bar. For a post workout bar, you should aim to have protein and carbohydrates. The bar should contain 12 to 18 g of protein and 50 to 75 g of carbohydrate per serving. For a general snack bar, you should aim for a bar that will satiate you until the next meal without filling you with empty calories. A breakfast bar or a post workout bar will work just fine as a snack. Whole grains and protein will help satiate you and won’t leave you feeling sluggish. It is important to keep the amount of fat down and the sugars to a minimum to avoid getting sleepy or crashing. The snack bar can be made into a soft, chewy bar that is more dense (consistency of a brownie), it can be very grainy and hard (consistency of granola cereal bar), or it can be grainy and chewy (chewy cereal bar).  For a soft, chewy bar you should use whole grain flours. Some good flours to choose from are whole wheat, whole white wheat, multi-grain, oat flour, and rye flour. These work well with savory as well as sweet bars and will add in extra fiber and vitamins. The whole grain flours also help manage blood glucose levels because the whole grains are less starchy and digest slower, keeping glucose levels in the blood steady. Since whole grain flours absorb more water (not just immediately, but also after they have been baked), it’s important to add more water to your recipe than you would use when cooking with refined white flour. These flours also contain more oils and will develop a rancid “cardboard” flavor sooner than refined flours. To help avoid this ‘off’ flavor, use fresh flour (check dates on the flour before purchasing), and keep it in an airtight container after opening. It may be helpful to buy small bags of flour to keep it from sitting in the cabinet too long. You can also add oats, cooked quinoa, cooked rice, wheat bran and other grains to the mixture to vary the texture and add more nutrition. For grainy bars, you should also use whole grains. However instead of flours, use the actual grains themselves. Ingredients like quinoa and rice will need to be cooked before use, while oats, flax and hemp can be used toasted or plain (quick cook oats work best when using oats). If you are making the bar crunchy, then dry out the quinoa in an oven before using. If you are using rice, then buy puffed rice cereal for a crispy cereal bar because it is cheap and easier than puffing rice at home. Seeds and nuts are also a great option to improve nutrition and taste, and they work in both savory and sweet bar recipes. Some seeds and nuts to try are almonds, sunflower seeds, walnuts and pumpkin seeds, which will add protein and good fat to the bar. The binder is an ingredient that acts like a glue to hold everything together.  Soft chewy bars do not need a binder because they are dense and the flour holds everything together. For grainy bars, you will need a binder to hold all the ingredients together. Try ingredients like beans, soy flour, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, honey, milk chocolate, agave nectar, peanut butter, or almond butter. Try to use ingredients that serve more than one purpose; for instance, peanut butter is source of fat and protein and will hold your bar together. When using beans, cook, drain and mash them up before use and mix with something sticky, like honey or almond butter. All these ingredients are nutrient dense because they serve a function in the bar and have macro and micronutrients in them. Not all bars need a sweetener in them but if you do decide to add one, keep in mind that it can also act as a binder. It is best to use liquid sweeteners to make the bars, but this is not a requirement. Granulated sugar or brown sugar can be used, but it will need to be melted first and will work best if mixed with butter to keep it from solidifying too quickly. The butter will also help it mix evenly with the other ingredients in your bar. You can use an artificial sweetener in your recipe as long as it is very soluble in water; Sucralose works well in this low-moisture application because it dissolves easily in water. Inclusions are ingredients added for taste and health purposes. Inclusions work best when used in pieces. All the pieces should be roughly the same size for even distribution.  Soy nuts are great for adding protein and crunch. Soy is one of the few plant-based proteins that is a complete protein; it contains all the essential amino acids the human body needs. Having said that, any nut is a good source of protein, even if it is not a complete protein, because nuts contain many amino acids the body uses for refueling and muscle repair. Adding an inclusion for protein may not be necessary because most of the whole grains or binders used will contain a fair amount of protein already. For instance, quinoa, flax and hemp are complete proteins. Also, combinations of ingredients will achieve greater protein content. Conversely, beans and rice are not complete proteins on their own, but together they create a complete protein. Other inclusions that work well are Edamame, chocolate nibs, dried fruit pieces, raisins, nuts and seeds, low-moisture vegetables, and yogurt bits. These all serve a health purpose and add good flavor. Cranberries are good for both men and women because they help prevent the adherence of bacteria throughout the urinary tract. Dark chocolate is a mood enhancer and full of antioxidants, which adds additional value to your bars. When making your bars, don’t put too many inclusions into them or the bars will not hold together properly. Cinnamon is a classic flavor and it has the highest antioxidant content of all the spices. This makes it good for you and good for the shelf life of your bars. When using cinnamon in a soft chewy bar, use it sparingly because it will affect how well the bar stays together. Other spices to try are soy powder or sauce, Worcestershire powder or sauce, cardamom, nutmeg, or clove. Remember that a little spice will go a long way, so be careful when adding spices. Spices are optional and can be omitted from your chosen recipe.",
      "If you cut into the bars before they are fully cooled, they will stick to each other. If you intend to eat them within two days, the bars can be covered and left to sit out at room temperature because of their low moisture content. The more sugar a bar contains, the safer it is to store it at room temperature because the sugar absorbs moisture and creates an environment that is hard for bacteria to thrive in. If they are going to be consumed over a longer period of time, you will need other options.  Vacuum seal individual bars to keep them at room temperature. The oxygen free environment reduces the chances that bacteria can grow. These can be kept in a cabinet for up to 5 days. Refrigerate the bars. This is the safest and best way to store them. In the fridge, the bars can last 7 to 10 days. Be wary of other foods in the fridge because the bars may have a tendency to pick up volatile flavors, like onion, which can ruin their taste. Freeze the bars. Bars can be frozen for an indefinite period of time without worry of microbiological contamination. However, the quality of the bars will degrade. It is best to freeze homemade snack bars for up to one month for optimum quality. Freezing will slowly dehydrate the bars, and, since they have so little moisture to begin with, too long in the freezer will cause them to crumble. Also, the moisture that comes out of the food can cause ice crystals on the surface of the food, which acts like a knife to the food breaking the texture. "

      "Take a look over the job posting to see if it contains any language that specifically requests no follow-ups. If they explicitly request that they contact you first, do not reach out to follow up. If they don’t make that request, you should still wait at least a week or so before reaching out. This gives hiring managers time to actually read your resume and get to know your materials. Some job postings will give you direct contact information for a hiring manager. If that is the case, use the information provided to follow up. If the posting does not provide a direct contact, though, you may need to search the company’s website or on professional networks such as LinkedIn to determine the likely hiring manager.  Depending upon the company, the hiring manager may be an HR person or a department head. Large companies tend to filter applications through an HR manager first, while small companies or specialized positions may go directly to the position supervisor. Hiring managers often get numerous email inquiries per day. They are easy to overlook and easy to ignore. To get your hiring manager’s attention, you need to say something more than, “Following up on my project manager application.”  Try making a personal connection. Look over the hiring manager’s professional profiles. Maybe they list an interest that you share. Then you can write a subject like, “Just one dirt bike enthusiast looking for a project position.” If you can’t find any common interests or human connections, you still need to use language that sets you apart. “An accounting wizard like you’ve never seen” is a lot more intriguing than “accountant looking for a job.” The body of your email should accomplish three main goals: introduce you, establish your interest and qualifications, and end with a question that invites a response. Each goal should be done in one or two sentences. Keep the body of your email short and friendly.  Avoid summarizing your entire resume or copying your cover letter. The hiring manager already has access to these materials. Your email may say something like, \"Hello. My name is Jane Smith and I recently applied for your game developer position. With four years of developer experience and two self-published games under my belt, I believe I could be a real asset to your team. Is there a good time for me to meet with you and your team about this opportunity?\" Just before signing off, find a polite way to invite yourself for an interview. A line like, “please let me know when we can talk more about this opportunity,” is gentle but still shows your confidence and interest in the position. A hiring manager is under no obligation to comply with your invitation. They may decide to meet with you, or they may simply ask you to wait until they decide on candidates. Either way, this request shows them that you are both brave and serious about the position. Sign off your email with a formal closing and your full name. Avoid sign-off like, “With love,” and, “Thx.” Instead, opt for something more professional like, “Sincerely,” or “Best regards.” Be sure to sign off with both your first and last name. This will help the hiring manager identify your application. After all, you never know how many people with the same name are applying. It can be tempting to follow up repeatedly, but the constant inquiries are a pain for HR. Only follow up on an application once. They will reach out to you if they want to speak further. If you are truly concerned that a technological error prevented the right person from getting your application, call the hiring manager or the HR department directly. You’re more likely to get a quick and honest answer that way.",
      "If you’re lucky enough to have scored an interview, be sure to follow up the same day or early the next morning. Send an email within 24 hours of your interview to each person with whom you met that day.  Send a thank you note to everyone who interviewed you. If you were interviewed by a committee, this means that each person should receive an individual thank you. Don’t just copy and paste the body of your email. Send a thank you for each round of interviews. If you do a second interview, send a second thank you. The body of your email should be brief. Thank the hiring manager for taking the time to meet with you. Then, use a sentence or two to express your interest and show how your skills qualify you for the job. You could say something like, “After meeting with you, I am especially excited for this position, and I believe my seven years of volunteer management experience would allow me to set up a new and exciting volunteer program for this company.” Just like with an application inquiry, your interview follow-up should end with a formal closing. Sign off with something like “Sincerely,” “Thank you,” or “Best regards,” before closing your email with your first and last name. If the hiring manager tells you that you’ll hear from them in a week and it’s been ten days, that deserves a follow-up. Send a quick email reaffirming your interest in the position and asking where they are in the hiring process.  Try not to follow up more than once. This can come across as eager or desperate. Do not follow up the day they said there would be a decision. Delays are inevitable, and you don’t want to seem like you’re rushing the process. Allow two or three days past the original deadline before you send your note.",
      "In the case of a call, you want to speak directly with the hiring manager. Avoid talking to a general HR specialist or a customer service representative. Even if they say they will take your message, the odds of it getting to the right person are slim. Call the contact listed in the job posting, if any. If no contact is posted, dig around online for the person that seems like the most likely fit. Peak hours for every company are a little different, so do a bit of research into the industry. Restaurants, for example, will be busiest during lunch and dinner hours, but may have some down time from 2pm to 4pm. Call during non-peak hours to raise your chances of the hiring manager answering.  No matter the industry, try not to call right after the start of business. People are generally bombarded with voicemails and emails at that time, and may not pick up. Don’t call directly before closing, either. Your contact person is likely packing up and getting ready to leave, and may be annoyed if they have to stay longer to answer a call. If the hiring manager answers when you call, the first thing you want to do after saying hello is to give them your name and request a quick status check on the hiring process. This will let you know if they are still going through resumes or if they have moved on to interviews and hiring. You may, for example, say something like, “Hello. This is John Doe calling about the cat groomer position. I am very excited about this role and your company, and I just wanted to make sure my application was received.” If the hiring manager confirms that your resume has been received, ask them if they need anything else from you. Use this as a chance to briefly talk about one of your skills related to the position. If you are applying for a graphic designer position, for example, ask the manager, “Do you need any more samples of my work? I could send some that really highlight my experience designing text-based logos.” Before you hang up, thank the hiring manager for their time and ask them about a time line for next steps. If you feel particularly bold, you can even end with a line like, “When would be a good time to meet and talk about this further?”"

      "Calculating Variance of a Sample",
      "Calculating Variance of a Population"
    ],
    "document": [
      "In most cases, statisticians only have access to a sample, or a subset of the population they're studying. For example, instead of analyzing the population \"cost of every car in Germany,\" a statistician could find the cost of a random sample of a few thousand cars. He can use this sample to get a good estimate of German car costs, but it will likely not match the actual numbers exactly.   Example: Analyzing the number of muffins sold each day at a cafeteria, you sample six days at random and get these results: 38, 37, 36, 28, 18, 14, 12, 11, 10.7, 9.9. This is a sample, not a population, since you don't have data on every single day the cafeteria was open.  If you have every data point in a population, skip down to the method below instead. The variance of a data set tells you how spread out the data points are. The closer the variance is to zero, the more closely the data points are clustered together. When working with sample data sets, use the following formula to calculate variance:   s2{\\displaystyle s^{2}} = ∑[(xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}]/(n - 1)   s2{\\displaystyle s^{2}} is the variance. Variance is always measured in squared units.  xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} represents a term in your data set. ∑, meaning \"sum,\" tells you to calculate the following terms for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}}, then add them together. x̅ is the mean of the sample. n is the number of data points. . The symbol x̅ or \"x-bar\" refers to the mean of a sample. Calculate this as you would any mean: add all the data points together, then divide by the number of data points.   Example: First, add your data points together: 17 + 15 + 23 + 7 + 9 + 13 = 84Next, divide your answer by the number of data points, in this case six: 84 ÷ 6 = 14.Sample mean = x̅ = 14. You can think of the mean as the \"centre-point\" of the data. If the data clusters around the mean, variance is low. If it is spread out far from the mean, variance is high. Now it's time to calculate xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅, where xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} is each number in your data set. Each answer tells you that number's deviation from the mean, or in plain language, how far away it is from the mean..   Example:x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - x̅ = 17 - 14 = 3x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - x̅ = 15 - 14 = 1x3{\\displaystyle x_{3}} - x̅ = 23 - 14 = 9x4{\\displaystyle x_{4}} - x̅ = 7 - 14 = -7x5{\\displaystyle x_{5}} - x̅ = 9 - 14 = -5x6{\\displaystyle x_{6}} - x̅ = 13 - 14 = -1 It's easy to check your work, as your answers should add up to zero. This is due to the definition of mean, since the negative answers (distance from mean to smaller numbers) exactly cancel out the positive answers (distance from mean to larger numbers). As noted above, your current list of deviations (xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅) sum up to zero. This means the \"average deviation\" will always be zero as well, so that doesn't tell use anything about how spread out the data is. To solve this problem, find the square of each deviation. This will make them all positive numbers, so the negative and positive values no longer cancel out to zero.   Example:(x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - x̅)2=32=9{\\displaystyle ^{2}=3^{2}=9}(x2{\\displaystyle (x_{2}} - x̅)2=12=1{\\displaystyle ^{2}=1^{2}=1}92 = 81(-7)2 = 49(-5)2 = 25(-1)2 = 1 You now have the value (xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} for each data point in your sample. Now it's time to calculate the entire numerator of the formula: ∑[(xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}]. The upper-case sigma, ∑, tells you to sum the value of the following term for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}}. You've already calculated (xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} in your sample, so all you need to do is add the results together.  Example: 9 + 1 + 81 + 49 + 25 + 1 = 166. A long time ago, statisticians just divided by n when calculating the variance of the sample. This gives you the average value of the squared deviation, which is a perfect match for the variance of that sample. But remember, a sample is just an estimate of a larger population. If you took another random sample and made the same calculation, you would get a different result. As it turns out, dividing by n - 1 instead of n gives you a better estimate of variance of the larger population, which is what you're really interested in. This correction is so common that it is now the accepted definition of a sample's variance.  Example: There are six data points in the sample, so n = 6.Variance of the sample = s2=1666−1={\\displaystyle s^{2}={\\frac {166}{6-1}}=} 33.2 Note that, since there was an exponent in the formula, variance is measured in the squared unit of the original data. This can make it difficult to understand intuitively. Instead, it's often useful to use the standard deviation. You didn't waste your effort, though, as the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. This is why the variance of a sample is written s2{\\displaystyle s^{2}}, and the standard deviation of a sample is s{\\displaystyle s}. For example, the standard deviation of the sample above = s = √33.2 = 5.76.",
      "The term \"population\" refers to the total set of relevant observations. For example, if you're studying the age of Texas residents, your population would include the age of every single Texas resident. You would normally create a spreadsheet for a large data set like that, but here's a smaller example data set:  Example: There are exactly six fish tanks in a room of the aquarium. The six tanks contain the following numbers of fish:x1=5{\\displaystyle x_{1}=5}x2=5{\\displaystyle x_{2}=5}x3=8{\\displaystyle x_{3}=8}x4=12{\\displaystyle x_{4}=12}x5=15{\\displaystyle x_{5}=15}x6=18{\\displaystyle x_{6}=18} Since a population contains all the data you need, this formula gives you the exact variance of the population. In order to distinguish it from sample variance (which is only an estimate), statisticians use different variables:  σ2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = (∑(xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}})/n  σ2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = population variance. This is a lower-case sigma, squared. Variance is measured in squared units.  xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} represents a term in your data set. The terms inside ∑ will be calculated for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}}, then summed. μ is the population mean n is the number of data points in the population When analyzing a population, the symbol μ (\"mu\") represents the arithmetic mean. To find the mean, add all the data points together, then divide by the number of data points.  You can think of the mean as the \"average,\" but be careful, as that word has multiple definitions in mathematics.  Example: mean = μ = 5+5+8+12+15+186{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5+5+8+12+15+18}{6}}} = 10.5 Data points close to the mean will result in a difference closer to zero. Repeat the subtraction problem for each data point, and you might start to get a sense of how spread out the data is.  Example:x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x3{\\displaystyle x_{3}} - μ = 8 - 10.5 = -2.5x4{\\displaystyle x_{4}} - μ = 12 - 10.5 = 1.5x5{\\displaystyle x_{5}} - μ = 15 - 10.5 = 4.5x6{\\displaystyle x_{6}} - μ = 18 - 10.5 = 7.5 Right now, some of your numbers from the last step will be negative, and some will be positive. If you picture your data on a number line, these two categories represent numbers to the left of the mean, and numbers to the right of the mean. This is no good for calculating variance, since these two groups will cancel each other out. Square each number so they are all positive instead.  Example:(xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} for each value of i from 1 to 6:(-5.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-5.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-2.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 6.25(1.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 2.25(4.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 20.25(7.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 56.25 Now you have a value for each data point, related (indirectly) to how far that data point is from the mean. Take the mean of these values by adding them all together, then dividing by the number of values.  Example:Variance of the population = 30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.256=145.56={\\displaystyle {\\frac {30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.25}{6}}={\\frac {145.5}{6}}=} 24.25 If you're not sure how this matches the formula at the beginning of this method, try writing out the whole problem in longhand:  After finding the difference from the mean and squaring, you have the value (x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}, (x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}, and so on up to (xn{\\displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}, where xn{\\displaystyle x_{n}} is the last data point in the set. To find the mean of these values, you sum them up and divide by n: ( (x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} + (x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} + ... + (xn{\\displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} ) / n After rewriting the numerator in sigma notation, you have (∑(xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}})/n, the formula for variance."

      "In 90% of all cases, a bacterial infection is to blame. This bacteria can be sexually transmitted (as with chlamydia or gonococcal, the bacteria that causes gonorrhea), but that’s not always the case. Other bacteria that frequently cause salpingitis are:  mycoplasma staphylococcus streptococcus Less commonly, salpingitis can be caused by a virus. In some cases, PID can begin an infection or inflammation in other reproductive organs, then spread to the fallopian tubes, causing salpingitis. PID involves any inflammation and infection in the reproductive organs, and it’s very common – more than a million women in the United States experience it each year. Medical procedures themselves aren’t to blame for salpingitis, but some of them are responsible for introducing bacteria through the cervix and into the uterus and fallopian tubes. Laparoscopy, uterine and endometrial biopsies, and dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedures can all do this, as can the insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD). Abortion, miscarriage, and childbirth can all introduce bacteria through the cervix and into the reproductive organs. This bacteria can cause salpingitis. If you have any of the symptoms above and have recently been pregnant (no matter what the outcome of that pregnancy was), you should definitely talk to your doctor as soon as possible.",
      "In some cases, salpingitis causes no noticeable symptoms. Therefore, you may not discover that you have the condition until your reproductive organs are examined for another reason, such as infertility. Some vaginal discharge is normal and healthy, but if you notice any changes in the amount, color, consistency, or smell, you should make an appointment with your gynecologist. Heavy or otherwise unusual discharge can indicate infection and a number of reproductive ailments, including salpingitis. If you bleed between your normal menstrual periods, schedule an appointment with your gynecologist. As with abnormal discharge, abnormal bleeding can indicate a number of possible problems, one of which is salpingitis. Changes in hormonal birth control can sometimes cause spotting between periods. If you have recently started a new birth control pill or gotten an intrauterine device (IUD), that may be the reason for your spotting. It is probably safe to wait a few months to see if the issue resolves itself, especially if you have no other symptoms of salpingitis. Most women experience some degree of cramping before and during their periods, but if yours are especially painful, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Very painful menstrual periods (also called dysmenorrhea) can sometimes be caused by salpingitis (as well as by endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroid tumors, and other conditions). See your gynecologist for a complete exam. This symptom is especially concerning if your menstrual periods were not always so uncomfortable. If the pain is new or has increased dramatically in severity, you should definitely consider it a warning sign that something is wrong. Seek treatment as soon as possible. Some women with salpingitis have noticeable abdominal pain, which can range in severity from mild to severe. This pain may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Salpingitis can cause the urethra to swell (this condition is known as urethritis). As a result, you may experience painful or frequent urination, and you may feel like you have a urinary tract or bladder infection. Many healthy women experience some pain or discomfort when they ovulate (this condition is sometimes called “mittelschmerz”). If you begin experiencing this problem suddenly, or if it occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, make an appointment with your gynecologist. Back pain can occur for many reasons, but if yours becomes severe, or if you have any other troubling symptoms, you should see a doctor. Some women with salpingitis experience lower back pain. When salpingitis leads to a serious infection, it can cause fevers and chills. If you have a fever along with other symptoms of salpingitis, you should see a doctor immediately. In some women, this fever is accompanied by back pain that shoots down the legs. If you experience this symptom, seek treatment immediately and mention it to your doctor. Women with salpingitis often notice that their symptoms appear during certain parts of the menstrual cycle – frequently after their periods.",
      "As a first course of action, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection. For most women with salpingitis (around 85%), antibiotics alone can successfully eliminate the problem. In more severe cases, your doctor may recommend that you enter the hospital. While there, you can receive fluids and antibiotics intravenously (through a needle in your arm). Most women are successfully treated with antibiotics, but in some cases, surgery does become necessary. Your doctor will recommend surgery if there are abscesses on your fallopian tubes that must be drained. In a small number of cases, you may also need a salpingectomy – the removal of damaged fallopian tubes. If your salpingitis is related to a larger case of pelvic inflammatory disease, you may wind up undergoing a complete hysterectomy along with a salpingo-oophorectomy. In such cases, a surgeon will remove your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. If your salpingitis is traced to a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea, your recent sexual partners should be tested and treated. Keep in mind that these partners may be infected even if they have no symptoms.",
      "If you have any reason to think you may have salpingitis (or pelvic inflammatory disease or another reproductive ailment), you should see a gynecologist as soon as possible. Provide a complete medical history and a detailed account of your symptoms. Your gynecologist will probably start by performing a standard pelvic exam to check for abnormal discharge, pain or tenderness, and other signs of inflammation. He or she will use a speculum to view the cervix and may perform a pap test to check for signs of cervical cancer. Your doctor may want to check your blood for various indicators of infection. A white blood cell count, for example, will help determine whether infection is present. Individual circumstances vary, but your doctor may want to perform other diagnostic tests. He or she may test your urine, for example, or perform other tests to view your reproductive organs. Depending on the severity of your symptoms and the results of other tests, your doctor may recommend laparoscopy – a medical procedure in which a device is inserted into the fallopian tubes through an abdominal incision. A laparoscopy will allow your doctor to see the fallopian tubes in detail. If your doctor decides that your fallopian tubes are infected and inflamed, he or she will diagnose you with salpingitis. If possible, he or she should determine the cause. Salpingitis is further divided into two basic categories: acute and chronic.  Acute salpingitis is a more severe attack, in which the fallopian tubes become swollen and inflamed; they may secrete fluid and stick to the intestines or other organs, and they may fill with pus. Chronic salpingitis is a lower-level inflammation, which often follows an acute episode. The infection is milder, but it also lasts longer. Some women are mistakenly diagnosed with cysts, endometriosis, or other problems before it becomes clear that the fallopian tubes are inflamed. You may have to be persistent. If your doctor thinks you have something else, but you doubt the diagnosis (or still have symptoms after treatment), get a second opinion."

      "Strengthening the core is essential in both the treatment and prevention of a slipped disc, and the accompanying sciatic pain. A strong and solid core helps to protect the spine from misalignment or injury, as the core muscles will keep the sciatic nerve in its proper place.  The core also stabilizes the spine against any twisting motions and reduces the effect of daily wear and tear on the spine.  As the core strengthens, you should no longer feel a one-sided shooting leg pain, which is one of the most common complaints of sciatica. The core muscles include the abs and transversus abdominis, obliques and the erector spinae muscle. These muscles are located at the front, side, and back of the abdomen and encase the spine. See below for some specific exercises you can do to strengthen the core muscles. The plank is one of the best exercises for relieving sciatic pain caused by a slip disk, as it keeps the spine in proper alignment and prevents the disc from slipping further. To correctly perform the plank exercise:  Assume a traditional push-up position on a soft surface such as a mat. The head, shoulder blades, and butt must form one straight horizontal line. The hands should be directly under the shoulders and feet are kept together. Brace your abdominal muscles as if you were preparing to be punched in the gut. Hold this position for 15 seconds, making sure that your hips do not drop down at any point during the exercise. Breathe deeply as you perform the exercise, this will prevent your blood pressure from spiking. There should be no pain, numbness, or tingling sensations throughout the exercise. If you feel any of these symptoms, rest for 15 minutes then try the modified plank position, which involves holding yourself up with your elbows and knees, rather than your hand and feet. Do 3 sets of 15-second holds, resting for 30 seconds in between each set. Work your way up to doing 30-second and then 1 minute-holds. Once you have built up the core doing regular planks (meaning that you can comfortably hold the plank position for 30 seconds) you can progress onto side planks. This exercise is great for strengthening the oblique muscles and helps to prevent sciatic leg pain, especially during twisting movements.  Lie down on your left side, keeping your body in a straight line. Make sure your left elbow is lined up directly below your left shoulder. Lift yourself up so your entire body weight is being supported by your left elbow and the outer side of your left foot. You body should form a straight diagonal line from your head to your foot. As you hold this position, keep your hips elevated above the ground with the aid of your left oblique muscles. Remember to keep your abs tight, as if you were bracing yourself for a punch in the stomach. Hold this position for 15 seconds. You shouldn't experience any pain, numbness, or tingling when performing the side plank exercise. If you do, rest for 15 minutes then try the modified side plank position. To do the modified side plank, you will bend your knees instead of keeping them straight, so you will be supporting your weight with your left elbow and left knee. Do 3 sets of 15-second holds, resting for 30 seconds in between. Switch sides and do 3 more repetitions on your right. Work your way up to 30-second holds. Hip thrusts are a great exercise for working the lower back, hip, and butt muscles. These muscles are part of the posterior chain, a group of muscles at the back of the body that supports the body weight and helps you to maintain proper posture. Good posture and equal distribution of weight lessens the pressure on the bones of the lower back and helps to relieve sciatica. To do a hip thrust:  Sit down on the floor with a bench or couch behind you. Rest your arms and upper back against the bench or couch. Position your feet hip-width apart with the knees bent (this position engages the hip and butt muscles later on in the exercise). Thrust your hips up until your torso and thighs are parallel to the floor. The knees should be bent and in-line above the ankles, while the feet remain in contact with the ground. Don’t forget to breathe in and out during the movement. Slowly lower your butt back towards the floor. This counts as one repetition. Do 3 sets of 15 reps daily with 1-minute rests in between. No pain, numbness, or tingling sensations should be felt during this exercise. If you do experience any of these symptoms, stop the exercise immediately and consult your physician. The cat and camel is a combination yoga pose that may improve spinal mobility, via flexion and extension. However, if the camel pose is performed incorrectly, it can lead to pinched nerves in the lumbar region. You should only include it as part of your exercise routine after you have developed a strong core using the three exercises outlined above.  Get down on all fours on a soft surface. The hands should be placed directly beneath the shoulders, while the knees should be under the hips. Do the camel part of the exercise: suck in your abs and round your back up towards the ceiling as far as you can. The shape of your back should resemble a camel’s hump. This position stretches your spinal erector muscles. Hold this position for 5 seconds, then return to the starting position. Next do the cat part of the exercise: Arch your back by pressing your stomach towards the floor and lifting your chest towards the ceiling to arch your upper back. This strengthens the lower back muscles and stretches the abdominals. Hold the position for 5 seconds. You should feel a stretch in your abdominal area. Alternate between the cat and camel posture for 5 times each. That counts as 1 set. Do 3 sets with 2 minutes rest in between. Avoid doing this exercise if you experience any slipped disc symptoms and see a doctor for proper guidance.",
      "People suffering from sciatica should stretch daily. Stretching helps to loosen the muscles compressing the sciatic nerve, thus alleviating pain. Stretching daily will not only improve existing symptoms, it will also help to prevent the condition from worsening. This is an easy exercise that will help to improve the flexibility of your lower back, relieving pressure on the sciatic nerve. To do this knee to chest stretch:  Lie flat on your back on the floor or an exercise mat. Place a flat cushion under your head. Place your feet flat on the floor and bend your knees. Grasp your right knee with both hands and slowly bring it towards your chest. You should feel your lower back stretching. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position. Repeat the exercise with your right leg, then do 3 to 5 repetitions on each leg. This specific exercise will move the sciatic nerve and hamstring, helping it to find a more comfortable position.  Lie on your back on an exercise mat and place a small flat cushion under your head. Keep your knees bent and your chin partially tucked in. Grab one knee with both hands and bring it closer to your chest. Grab your hamstring with both hands, then try to straighten your leg. Continue to pull your knee towards your chest as you attempt to straighten the leg. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds while taking deep breaths. Bend the knee and slowly return to the starting position. Repeat with the opposite leg, then continue for 3 to 5 repetitions of each leg. This exercise will move and stretch the spine backwards. This exercise is particularly beneficial for patients who suffer from secondary sciatic symptoms and disc herniation .  Lie on your stomach, then use your elbows to prop up your head and torso. Keep your neck and back long. Keeping your neck straight and your hips on the ground, arch your back as high as comfort permits. You should feel a stretch in your lower back and stomach muscles. Hold this position for 10 seconds while practicing deep breathing. Return to the starting position, then repeat this exercise 10-15 times. This exercise helps to stretch the hamstring muscles.  Stand up straight in front of an elevated surface (approximately knee height), such as a stool or chair. Lift one leg and rest your heel on top of the elevated surface. Keep your knee and leg as straight as possible while your toes point upward. Lean forward, placing your hands on your knee for support. Try to keep your back straight as you do this. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, while taking deep breaths. Repeat the exercise on the opposite leg, then continue for 3 to 5 repetitions on each leg. This exercise helps to keep your butt muscles flexible, which allows your to perform a wider range of movement.  Start by lying on your back, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Place a small cushion under your head for support. Raise your left foot and place it over your right thigh. Link your hands at the back of your right thigh and pull the leg towards your chest. Keep your tailbone and hips on the floor throughout the exercise. You should be able to feel a stretch in your right buttock. Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds while practicing deep breathing. Bring the foot back to the starting position then repeat the exercise with the other leg. Do 3 to 5 repetitions on each leg. This stretch helps the sciatic nerve slide through the spine unrestricted, which can improve pain and mobility. Start in a seated position with your head facing down toward the ground. To do the stretch, look up to the ceiling as you also lift your right leg, straightening it at the knee. Return to your start position to complete the stretch. Do 20-30 repetitions, then switch and repeat for the left side.",
      "There are several different root causes of sciatic pain, however they all involve irritation of the sciatic nerve, either through compression, kinking or physical trauma. Some of the most common causes include:   A lumbar herniated disc: This happens when a disc in the spinal column “spills” out from its original place. This herniated disc comes in contact with the sciatic nerve, compressing it and causing pain and irritation. 'Degenerative disc disease: This condition is usually associated with aging. As the spinal disc ages, it weakens and may partially collapse leading to compression of the sciatic nerve.  Piriformis syndrome: This is when the piriformis muscle (located in the buttocks) compresses the sciatic nerve.  Lumbar spinal stenosis: This occurs when the spinal canal narrows in size, pushing its content outward and causing a kink in the sciatic nerve. 'Abnormalities in the spine: Anything abnormal in the structure of the lumbar spine may lead to sciatica. This may include infection, injury, tumor, internal bleeding, bone fracture or muscle weakness. The primary symptom of sciatica is pain. The pain may be felt along the length of the sciatic nerve, which runs through the lower back, buttocks, hips and legs. Because of the sciatic pain, the patient may have difficulty of moving, bending and walking. An accurate diagnosis of sciatica is important, as this will help the doctor to determine how the condition should be managed. The process for diagnosing sciatica will usually involve the follow:   A physical examination: A physical examination may be performed, involving the straight-leg-raise test. The doctor will ask you to lie down and raise your leg slowly. The doctor will note the point at which pain is felt to determine which part of the sciatic nerve is affected.  X-ray: An x-ray may be ordered to rule out fracture of the spine.  MRI and CT scans: These may be prescribed by your doctor to aid in diagnosing sciatica. Detailed images of the lower back are created to learn more about the problem.  Additional tests: Other nerve tests may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.These may include: velocity studies, electromyography, myelogram and evoked potential testing.",
      "The best cardiovascular exercise for sciatica sufferers is swimming. Swimming places minimal stress on the back and the legs while still providing an effective cardio workout, that gets the heart rate up and burns calories. This gives you all the advantages of a cardio workout without compromising on comfort. For best results, try to swim for 30 minutes a day, five times per week. Pilates is a great, low-impact way to improve the strength of your muscles without causing too much sciatic pain. Most Pilates maneuvers involve stretching the muscles using slow, smooth movements. For more information on how to do Pilates, see this article. Yoga is another great, low-impact form of exercise that helps to alleviate pain on the back and prevent it from recurring. Yoga is a combination of stretching and breathing techniques – making it the perfect activity for relieving sciatic pain. For more information on how to do yoga, see this article. Although it has numerous general health benefits, running is not a recommended form of cardio exercise for people suffering from sciatica. Running is stressful and jars the lower back and legs, which may cause sciatic pain to become worse. However, going for a walk is recommended for people with sciatica, provided you warm up with dynamic range of motion exercises, stretch after the walk, and correct posture is maintained throughout the exercise."

      "You don't want to be running around looking for cleaning products with a wet dog in the tub, so have everything in one place before you start. You should also make sure that you're properly dressed in clothes you don't mind getting messy because you will get wet. At the very least, you will need:   Dog shampoo Treats Several towels Place one towel on the edge of the tub to keep water from splashing over the tub. The rest are for drying. Some dogs like to make a run for it during bath-time. If this describes your dog, buy a dog bath lead from the pet supply store. It's a leash that attaches to the shower's wall with a suction cup and keeps your dog in place during the bath. Replace the dog's regular collar with one that will not stain the coat or suffer water damage. A slip lead that adjusts to a struggling dog is best but the dog may choke itself no matter the restraint so monitor his breathing carefully and adjust or simply push them back when necessary. Use a squeegee or use your hand as a squeegee to force water off of the coat and body. Towel-dry him as best as you can while he's still in the tub, so you don't make a mess. Place the towel over your dog’s back, or hold it next to him and give permission to shake the water off their body. Many dogs will learn the “bath rules” and wait to shake until you have placed the towel over them to contain the water droplets.  Another type of towel to use is a chamois, which is a thin fleece-like towel that is designed to be wrung out when wet. It lessens the number of towels needed and does the bulk of the work. Using a chamois, then a towel makes drying less of a hassle. If you have a double-coated or long-haired dog, you may need to blow the coat dry.",
      "Many breeds have short hair and don't require regular clipping. However, if you have a shaggier breed of dog, he may require regular clipping as part of his health routine. Breeds that need regular coat trims include cocker spaniel, sheepdog, poodle, collie, Shih Tzu, Pekingese, and chow chow, among others. It's worth it to spend a little bit of extra money on a good pair of dog grooming clippers. A small investment up front will save you money down the road, since you won't have to pay professionals to groom your pet.  Make sure to use dog grooming blades that will give you the coat length you desire. Scissors will likely not give you a nice, even coat, and you may hurt the dog with them if he moves suddenly. Grooming clippers are recommended over scissors. You may have to go over your dog's coat a few times before you have a smooth, even cut. Don't rush it! Give your dog as many breaks as necessary, and make sure to move your clippers slowly. Brushing up against the coat then going the spot with clippers again help to get a smooth cut. Do will have to be done many times before you are done.",
      "You don't want to be looking for your tools once you begin grooming your dog. Make sure to have everything you need in one place before you begin the task at hand. Consult the \"Things You'll Need\" section below to find out what you'll need to groom your dog. Reward calm, quiet behavior to encourage more of it. You may want to include a treat to reward the dog for good behavior. You don't want the dog to get overwhelmed; any negative associations can make grooming harder in the future. Make the experience fun by giving your pet breaks from time to time, giving praise, treats, pets, and even a little bit of play. This will also keep your dog distracted. This is especially important with a puppy, which can be trained from a young age to tolerate this much handling well. White-haired breeds or those with large eyes that water a lot (Pekingese, Pugs, Pomeranians, etc.) may need more maintenance in this area than others. Depending on your particular dog, this step may be a simple matter of wiping or pulling eye debris away from the corners of the eyes. Long-haired or white-haired dogs may need special attention to make sure that all gunk is out of the coat, as they may get tear stains. You can buy products made for removing \"tear stains\" from a white coat at a pet supply store.  A healthy eye should be clear and should not show any signs of irritation or unusual discharge. Don't try to trim hair away from the eyes yourself, as you might injure your pet. Ask your vet or groomer to do it for you. Your dog needs medical attention if his ears look swollen, red, irritated, dark or blackened. Any discharge or sores, or a bad or yeast-like smell should also prompt a call to the vet. Excessive discharge, inflammation, one ear is much dirtier than the other, and odor are signs of an ear infection that need medication. If your dog already has a considerable buildup of tartar and plaque, a simple tooth-brushing won't be enough. Just like a human would, your dog needs a professional cleaning at the veterinarians. Another option is anesthesia-free teeth cleaning, which is available but typically not offered by veterinarians. Look for red gums or brown material attached to the teeth — these are signs that a home tooth-brushing will be painful for your dog. Don't try to brush his teeth until he's seen a vet. If left untrimmed, a dog's nails can curl under into the paw pads or twist toes in a way that causes joint damage. To keep your dog's nails short, clip them regularly, depending on how fast his nails grow. If you can hear his nails on the ground when he walks, that means his nails are touching the ground, and are too long.   Trim a very small amount of nail (1/16 inch) away with a pair of dog nail clippers. Human clippers are okay for a very young puppy or small dog. Guillotine style clippers are less effective than the scissor type. Also, use the appropriate size clippers for your dog. If your dog has clear nails, you can see the pink part (The quick) where the blood vessel's located. Avoid cutting the pink part, trimming only the clear hard nail. Take extra care with dark-nailed dogs not to clip to the quick (blood vessel). Go slowly, and only take a little bit off at a time. Dremeling is much safer and easier to avoid hitting the quick, as it shaves only a little bit at a time. Use a cordless pet-safe Dremel tool, as the corded ones will not stop turning if they catch hair. Don't dremel for too long as it will burn the nail and prolong the trimming process for the dog which causes more stress. The best recommended process is trim first then dremel to shorten a little bit and round out the nail do it's not sharp. If you cut too far and hit a blood vessel, apply styptic powder, cornstarch, or flour with a bit of pressure and hold for a few seconds to stop any bleeding. For most dogs, this is the worst part for them. Some people do this step last to avoid the dog immediately becoming too stressed to do much grooming afterward. If trimming nails last and quick the nail, you can wash just the paw with a little water or wipe it off with hydrogen peroxide to get the blood off after applying blood clotting substances."

      "Spotting a Honey Bee",
      "Telling the Difference Between Male and Female"
    ],
    "document": [
      "The easiest way to differentiate a honey bee from other types of bees or wasps is to look at the shape of their thorax and abdomen. Honey bees have a distinctive barrel-shaped body and don't have a thin middle section between the thorax and abdomen like other insects. Wasps tend to have a very thin middle section and distinct thorax and abdomen. Honey bees have a thorax and abdomen that look like one complete piece. Honey bees are generally covered in small hairs that make them look fuzzy all over. Honey bees, unlike bumble bees, tend to have shorter hairs that are only visible when looking at them up close. These tiny hairs are how the honey bee gathers pollen and transports it to other flowers, so the hair is very important for the survival of the bee! Honey bees are pollinators and will be flying between flowers and their nest to provide pollen and nectar to the colony. Wasps are carnivores, and will be travelling to locations where there are other insects to eat.  Wasps and other carnivorous insects will also be attracted to human food, like your picnic. Honey bees normally won't come around human food but may be attracted by nearby flowers or other sweet scents. As such, you can take a number of steps to keep away from bees and wasps when you're eating outside. Other bees, such as orchid bees, will also fly between flowers to pollinate. This method is only good for differentiating between bees and wasps. Honey bees have hairy eyes to collect pollen from flowers and transport it over long distances. Honey bees will have two larger eyes on either side of their head, and then three small eyes in a triangle shape in the center of the head, which is a distinguishing trait of honey bees. Male and female honey bees have eyes that are slightly different sizes and shapes, but they are both still hairy. Honey bee nests are easy to spot because they have the distinctive “honeycomb” structure in either white or yellow color. They won't build nests hanging from tree branches, like other types of bees, because the nest and honey would be unprotected. Instead, look inside of hollow trees or manmade structures.  Honey bees will never make a nest in the ground. If you see insects have nested in holes, they are likely Yellow Jacket wasps, which are very dangerous and can sting. Honey bee nests never have a protective or paper-like coating around them. They are open to the air and can appear shiny due to the nectar and honey being produced.",
      "Male honey bees tend to be around 2 centimetres (0.79 in) long, which is slightly larger than female honey bees, which are normally 1.25 centimetres (0.49 in). The small size of the female bees, which are also known as worker bees, allow them to move quickly from flower to flower to pollinate and collect food for the nest.  Males tend to have bodies that are more rounded than females, making them less agile while in flight. The largest honey bee in the colony is the female queen bee, but it will only emerge from the nest when it's time to swarm. It's very unlikely that you will spot a queen bee outside of the nest! Female honey bees have smaller eyes on either side of their head that are proportional to their bodies. Male bees have very large eyes that make it easier for them to spot the queen as she is moving about.  The female bee's small, separated eyes help to locate flowers and plants to pollinate while in flight. The male bee's eyes will appear to touch at the top of the head, giving them a circular shape. Most honey bees seen pollinating are female worker bees. The large male, or drone, bees can normally be found in the area near the nest. Male bees won't venture too far from the location of the nest and the queen bee. Male bees will sometimes fly away from the nest in large groups to mate with other queens."

      "Using a Smartphone Otoscope Attachment",
      "Using a Traditional Otoscope on Someone Else"
    ],
    "document": [
      "There are 2 basic categories of smartphone otoscope attachments—those that clip over your phone's camera, and those that attach by cable to your phone's USB or Lightning port. Shop online for a model that is compatible with your phone.  A traditional otoscope is basically a magnifying glass with a handle, a light, and a cone-shaped tip that is inserted into the outer section of the inner ear. Smartphone otoscopes either magnify the image for your phone's camera, or act as their own magnifying camera, and record video. Scopes range in price from less than $50 USD to over $300 USD. You can check product reviews for guidance, and you may also want to ask your doctor if they have any experience with or recommendations for such devices. If you're a MacGyver-type, you can even try making one yourself! Most if not all models of scope attachments pair with a brand-specific app. Download this app for guidance on installing the scope, using it, and saving or sending the images/video.  The apps are typically free, but of course you've already had to pay for the scope! Most otoscope attachments record video as opposed to taking pictures, since this makes it easier for the average novice to get some decent inner ear views. No matter if you're using a traditional otoscope or a smartphone attachment, never stick the speculum (the pointed part) more than 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) into your ear. Your inner ear is very sensitive, and you definitely don't want to damage your eardrum! If you are unsure of your abilities, or if you're experiencing ear pain, let a medical professional examine your ear instead. With the app open and the speculum placed just barely into your ear, you should see video of your inner ear appear on your phone screen. Follow the product instructions for recording video, and move the speculum around slowly to get a full view of your inner ear. Do not stick the speculum deeper into your ear if the image is grainy, blurry, or dark. Check the settings for the product to see if you can improve the image. Self-diagnosis is not recommended by medical professionals nor the manufacturers of smartphone otoscope attachments. Instead, you should send the video to your doctor or another trained medical professional for a proper diagnosis.  Some apps may provide a way to send the video directly to on-call doctors for diagnosis, possibly at a cost of around $15 USD per analysis.  Based on scholarly analysis of certain smartphone otoscopes, the image quality and diagnostic quality of scope attachments matches up well with traditional otoscopes. In fact, some doctors may even prefer the results they provide.",
      "Most modern otoscopes use a single-use, disposable speculum (the pointed part that you put into the person's ear). Specula come in different sizes, and the proper size should fit snugly into the outer third (no more than 2 cm (0.79 in) deep) of the person's ear canal.  Use the following guidelines for speculum size: adults, 4-6 millimeters; children, 3-4 millimeters; infants, 2 millimeters. The speculum usually just snaps onto the pointed part of the otoscope. Dispose of the speculum after a single use. If you have a reusable speculum, sanitize it thoroughly according to the product instructions. Flip the switch or push the button to light up the tip of the otoscope, then grasp the handle between your thumb and forefinger like a pencil or pen. Touch the back of your holding hand to the person's cheek to help steady both your hand and the scope.  Be calm and move gently during an examination of someone else's ear. Many people don't like the feeling of having something stuck into their ear, and the ear is a very sensitive organ that can be easily damaged. If possible, watch a medical professional use an otoscope before trying it yourself. Lightly pinch their outer ear between your fingers, at either the 10 o'clock (for the right ear) or 2 o'clock (for the left ear) positions. Gently tug their outer ear up and back—this will straighten out the person's ear canal and make it easier for you to get a clear view inside. If you're checking a child under 3 years old, try gently pulling the outer ear downward first. This may provide a better view. While keeping the back of your holding hand against the person's cheek, carefully place the tip of the speculum into the outer section of their ear canal. Look into the otoscope with your dominant eye and close your other eye.  Do not press the speculum into their ear canal with any amount of force. Simply guide the tip 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) in. If it won't go in easily, you likely have too large of a speculum attached. If the person indicates any pain or discomfort, stop immediately and carefully withdraw the otoscope. Have a medical professional do the examination instead. Begin your examination at this angle, which follows the path of the ear canal. Once you have a clear view, gently move the otoscope around at different angles to examine other parts of the eardrum and ear canal walls. Quickly but carefully withdraw the otoscope if the person says they feel pain or discomfort. You aren't a trained medical professional, so don't try to diagnose any type of ear problems. If the person is having ear troubles of any type, tell them to see a doctor. If they aren't having any problems, though, look for the following signs to confirm a healthy inner ear:  The ear canal itself should be flesh-colored and covered in tiny hairs. It's also normal to have some brown or reddish-brown earwax on the canal walls, but the wax shouldn't be blocking the canal. There shouldn't be any signs of swelling. The eardrum should be translucent and white or gray in color. You should be able to see tiny bones pressing against the inside surface of the eardrum. Draw the speculum straight out of the person's ear canal and pull the back of your hand off of their cheek. Let go of their outer ear with your other hand. Now you can check the other ear. Checking someone else's ears, or having them check yours, is never an adequate substitute for a proper medical checkup. Use an otoscope only to confirm that your inner ear looks healthy, not to diagnose a problem when it doesn't feel right."

    ],
    "document": [
      "The power in watts is the rate at which energy is generated or used. Many utility companies will bill you based on how many watts of energy you used. The watt is basically how much energy an appliance uses.   Rated watts are the amount of watts needed to keep an appliance running. For example, refrigerators usually require 500 watts to keep running. You may need to know the watts in your home if you are trying to become more energy efficient, add solar panels, or use a generator. Electrical power comes in AC and DC currents. AC means alternating current; the electrical current constantly reverses direction and is used often in homes and offices. DC means direct current, and it means the current only travels in one direction. You will find it in things like battery packs.  Surge watts means the amount of watts needed to get an appliance started by igniting its motor or compressor. For example, it might take 2,000 watts to start the motor and compressor of a refrigerator. Watts are a basic unit of power (electric, mechanical, or thermal). The reason watts matter is because you can improve energy efficiency if you understand them.  Lower your watts, and you will improve energy efficiency and save money. Here’s an example. Let's say you are buying a light bulb, and one is 100 watts and the other is 23 watts. If the 100 Watt bulb is cheaper, you might assume it’s the better purchase. However, over time, the 23 Watt bulb will save you money. Do simple subtraction to determine the watt difference. In this case, that is 77 watts (100-23). Utility companies will often charge you using kilowatts. To find out the number of kilowatts, take the number of watts divided by 1,000. Then take the number of kilowatts multiplied by your hours of usage. This is the kilowatt/hr. Then, take kilowatt/hr and multiply that number by the cost of your energy. This is your annual cost. For example, let’s say you have 10 lights. They are each 100 watts. 10 X 100 = 1,000 watts. 1,000 Watts divided by 1,000 = 1 kW. Let’s say you’ve used 2,000 hours of energy. Thus, 1kW X 2,000 hours per year = 2,000 kwh. Let’s say your utility company charges you 10 cents for every kilowatt hour. You would take 2,000 kwh X .10 = $200, That's what it would cost you to use those bulbs for the year.",
      "There are many resources online that use calculators to determine watts. They will do the formula for you.  Such resources typically ask you to enter the number of volts, and the number of amps. Then you are asked to hit the “calculate” button to get the watts. Keep in mind, though, that online calculators aren’t always accurate because every appliance is going to be slightly different in its power needs. Some online sites will give you the watts needed if you click on the appliance type, such as a television or desktop computer. Sites sometimes have charts that list the watts used by various appliances, from refrigerators to boom boxes. You can figure out how many watts an appliance needs by looking for the data plate.  Find this on the back of your appliance. It’s likely to list how many volts, amps, and watts you need to power your appliance. You might find this information stamped on the back of the appliance. Or you could find the wattage listed on the nameplate.  Wattage meters plug into the appliance, and they tell you the exact amount of power that the appliance needs to run. The wattage of an appliance might vary depending on its setting. For example, a radio is going to use more watts if you turn the volume on high.",
      "You will need to know the amps and the volts in the power source. To determine the wattage, use a simple multiplication formula. The ampere (or amps) is the amount of electricity used. Voltage measures the force or pressure of the electricity.  The number of watts is equal to amps multiplied by volts. That's it! In other words, watt=amp X volt. Sometimes you will see this formula written as W=A X V.   For example, if the current is 3 amps (3A) and the voltage is 110V, you multiply 3 by 110, to get 330W (watts). The formula is P=3A X 110V = 330 W (with P standing for power). This is why watts are sometimes called volt-amps. Circuit breakers usually have the amps written on their handles. This is the maximum amperage that circuit can take before the circuit breaker trips. You can also determine both volts and amps by looking on the labels or in the operating manuals. You can  look up common figures for standard appliances (most small appliances and lighting fixtures in homes require circuits that range from 15-20 amps and larger ones are 20 to 60. However, most counter top household appliances are rated for 120 volts and operated with 12 or less amps.  Larger appliances like ranges and clothes dryers require more power and are connected to circuits that are wired to 240 volt power and may draw 20 to 40 amps depending on a number of factors.   Household wiring is usually 120 or 240 volts in North America. You can do the multiplication formula in reverse. For example, let’s say you have an AC 24-40 power supply. This means your power supply has 24 volts and 40 watts.  The power source can supply 1.6 amps. The formula used is 40-? X 24. Thus, you would divide 40 by 24 to get 1.6.  Here’s another reason you might need to do this. Let’s say you want to figure out the watts used by a ceiling fan, and the label on the fan says that the fan uses a certain number of amps. You could then find out the typical number of volts used by a ceiling fan (by calling the manufacturer or just looking online), multiply the two numbers, and generate an estimate of the wattage needed to run the ceiling fan. If you want to know wattage of a resistor, you will need to know the voltage (V) and the current (known as I). This is called Ohm’s law.  The multiplication formula is voltage multiplied by current, expressed as W=V X I. . Sometimes you will see the formula written with a P for power. The formula gets more complex when the power is changing over time. It involves using the time period to get the average. It’s hard to calculate, and for this kind of measurement, you should use special equipment known as a wattage meter."

      "After you are diagnosed with schizophrenia, your health care providers should set you up with a community mental health team, sometimes called assertive community treatment (ACT). These teams consist of highly experienced professionals from a variety of backgrounds who can provide day-to-day individualized treatment and support for living with schizophrenia. Your team might consist of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, pharmacists, counselors, social workers, and occupational therapists. Receiving support from your loved ones is critical to your ability to manage schizophrenia. Include your family and friends in doctor visits, ACT team meetings, therapy sessions, and support groups. Encourage them to ask your treatment team any questions they need to better support you. You might also make special requests as to how your loved ones can support you. These may include helping you spot early warning signs, helping you remember your medications, accompanying you to appointments, and helping you relearn skills to function in everyday life. Being diagnosed with schizophrenia can make you feel isolated and misunderstood. That’s why it’s a great idea to connect with other people who are living with the condition. Self-help and support groups are designed to help you build relationships with others with schizophrenia.  In support groups, you might discuss helpful coping strategies, get education about managing schizophrenia, and share stories about what’s it like living with the disorder. Ask your doctor or therapist about schizophrenia support groups in your area. Ask your community mental health team or support group about how you can receive social skills training. These behavioral interventions can help you better function in the community and feel more capable of managing schizophrenia. Social skills training can improve your quality of life by helping you behave appropriately in social situations, solve problems, communicate more effectively with those around you, and deal with everyday life stress. Doing meaningful work in your community can also help improve your quality of life with schizophrenia. Consider getting vocational training to help you develop transferrable skills, look for a job that suits your lifestyle and condition, and learn how to manage your money. In some cases, vocational training may be grouped in with social skills training.",
      "Since food is fuel for the body and the brain, consuming a  nutrient-rich diet can support your mental health. Avoid sugar, refined carbohydrates, coffee, and alcohol. Such foods can worsen your symptoms. Instead, eat plenty of green vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein, beans, nuts and seeds. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to support brain health. Get omega-3s from salmon, mackerel, flaxseed, and walnuts. Or, ask your doctor about taking an omega-3 supplement. Exercise offers neuroprotective benefits to the brain while boosting your energy and mood. Aerobic exercise, in particular, has been shown to improve your ability to understand social situations, enhance attention span, and boost working memory. Get at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day. Try aerobic exercises like running, hiking, swimming, dancing, or cycling. Poor sleep habits can signal a  relapse of schizophrenia symptoms or worsen ongoing symptoms. It’s important to talk to your doctor about sleep problems and come up with a game plan for improving sleep quality and duration.  Try sleeping only at night, reserving the bedroom for sleep and sex, and powering off electronic devices at least an hour before bed. You might also create a  bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or doing some light reading. If sleep problems persist, tell your doctor. They may be able to prescribe new medications or change your current meds to help you sleep better. Living with schizophrenia can mean having many days in which your symptoms are especially bad, leading to loss of contact with reality and even hospitalization. It can help to improve your outlook of living with this condition by starting a gratitude practice. Gratitude has been shown to benefit brain health and mood. Reap the benefits by jotting down some of the good things that happen on days when your symptoms are manageable.",
      "To receive an adequate  diagnosis of schizophrenia, start by visiting your family physician. This doctor may be your first line of treatment for schizophrenia. They can conduct a physical examination, review your medical history, and help rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. If your doctor doesn’t find any medical explanation for your symptoms, they may refer you to a mental health provider for further testing. A  psychiatrist or psychologist may perform a battery of tests to check your mental status and ask questions about your symptoms.  Be honest and upfront about any symptoms you experience. Giving your mental health provider the full picture of your symptoms ensures that you receive the right diagnosis. Your doctor may ask whether you have seen or felt things that others didn’t (hallucinations) or have unshakable beliefs that aren't based in reality (delusions). Medication is typically at the foundation of treatment for schizophrenia. These medications work by improving the balance of chemicals in the brain that make you lose touch with reality. Talk to your doctor to determine which medication is right for you.  The most effective medications for schizophrenia include antipsychotics, particularly second-generation medications that have fewer serious side effects (also known as atypical antipsychotics). Keep in mind, however, that you may have to try several medications before finding the one that best helps you manage your schizophrenia symptoms. Follow your doctor’s orders when taking your medications. Never stop taking your meds unless your doctor has instructed you to, as doing so could lead to serious side effects. If you experience negative side effects from your medication, let your doctor know as soon as possible. They will likely be able to switch you to a different medication. Although medication is the best way to reduce schizophrenia symptoms, many people also find that talk therapy also helps them manage schizophrenia. Psychotherapy may involve educating yourself about how schizophrenia impacts your functioning, helping you cope with stress that exacerbates symptoms, and conducting reality testing. In addition to one-on-one therapy, you might also consider group therapy or family therapy. Both of which can help you learn to better manage living with schizophrenia. Electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, is a procedure in which currents are sent through the brain to reverse the symptoms of severe mental illness. When used in combination with medication, ECT has proven to be an effective form of treating severe forms of schizophrenia that are resistant to typical treatments. If you are failing to see improvements from second-generation antipsychotics, you might ask your doctor about ECT."

      "Deciding If It's Time For A Written Warning"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Although requirements may vary amongst organizations, there are some common elements that you will want to include in your written warning.  Review the following points of information to build an informative and effective written warning:  Include the names of any parties involved. The nature of the offense. The date and time the offense occurred. Details of the warning and the time period involved in the warning. Instructions for the employee regarding how to remedy the situation. Consequences of this infraction as well as the consequences of future issues. When you are writing your warning you will need to be as specific and detailed as possible.  Including clear and concise details in your warning will help convey the exact issue at hand and allow your employee to better make corrections and avoid further offenses in the future.  Include clear statements that describe the issue at hand.  For example \"On June 23rd, you were reported as having been involved in a physical altercation with another employee\". Warnings should make clear what will happen if the employee's behavior is not corrected.  For example \"If another infraction occurs, we will issue only one final warning before termination.\" Although the warning is written, you won't be sending it through company mail or email.  Delivering a written warning will need to be done in person, during a private meeting with the employee in question.  This will allow for direct conversation between both parties and a clear communication of the issue at hand.  Make the meeting for the earliest date available. Give some positive feedback as well.  Don't just focus on the negative during the meeting. Once you have written the warning and delivered it to the employee, you will want to make sure that the employee understands the warning. Discuss the terms of the warning, the duration it will last, why they are receiving it and how they can work to correct their course of action in the future.   Most written warnings will have a place for signatures.  Have your employee sign the warning, declaring that they understood and agree with it.  Allow the employee the right to dispute the claim as well.  Some information may not be correct and they should have the right to question the warning.",
      "Warnings that are issued to an employee are generally issued following a certain progression or escalation.  By sticking to the progression you can help the employee understand exactly what level of discipline they are currently receiving and just how serious the issue is.  Review the following progression of employee warnings to learn if it is time for a written warning:  Verbal warning Written warning Final written warning Termination of the employee. Before you issue the written warning to an employee you will want to consult your organization's disciplinary code.  Make sure that the code agrees with your decision to issue a written warning.  Match the severity of the issue to the disciplinary code that your organization uses before you submit your written warning.  Some issues may not be very serious or are a first time occurrence with that employee.  These may require a simple verbal warning. Other issues may be quite serious and could warrant a written warning, bypassing the verbal warning.  These might include theft or threats of violence. Before you create a written warning you will need to collect all the relevant information regarding the employee and the issue at hand.  Collecting this information will allow you to judge if the written warning is appropriate as well as allow you to write a detailed and effective warning.  Learn the dates and times of any employee infractions. Detail any conversations or previous verbal warnings about this issue. Collect old documents which the employee signed, documenting their acceptance to company terms and illustrating their violation of them. Before you complete and issue your written warning you will want to speak privately with the employee in question.  This meeting will allow you to further understand the situation and accurately judge if the next step is to issue a written warning to the employee.  The conversation may reveal that the issue was a misunderstanding and no further action is needed. You may be able to collect more information about the incident, allowing you to better issue your written warning should it be necessary. In larger organizations it may be unclear as to who should be the one to deliver the written warning, especially if the employee has more than one supervisor or manager.  Make sure that it is company policy that you are the one required to write or deliver the warning to the employee.  Generally, the direct supervisor will issue the letter. In some cases, the decision to issue the written warning may be decided by a group meeting."

      "A sharpened hoe blade allows you to sever the weeds without having to bend over or crouch. Swing the blade against the weed near the base, then leave the weed to decompose. If vegetables are already growing, a thin-bladed \"onion hoe\" may be easiest to maneuver without damaging the useful plants.  If the weed already has visible seed pods or seed heads, pull these off before you cut, and discard them in a trash can covered or far away from your garden. A stirrup hoe helps take weeds out easily. It has blades that run parallel to the ground, making it easy to go along and cut weeds down. Hand-pulling weeds can be a slow process, but is often necessary when weeds sprout too close to vegetables to risk swinging a hoe. This also allows you to remove the roots of large weeds as well as the surface plant, preventing the same weed from growing again.  Using a tool such as a gardening trowel or Hori-Hori knife may make this task easier and reduce strain on your hands. Pruning shears are notoriously un-ergonomic, which can causes problems such as arthritis. When choosing pruners, make sure that they fit your hand well and  don't require excessive push to move the blades. For weeds growing next to small crops, press your fingers down on either side of the weed to keep soil in place while pulling.  Removing weeds is easier while the soil is beginning to dry out from a watering. However, avoid walking on or pressing wet soil, which can reduce aeration. Post-emergent herbicides are designed to kill weeds that have already grown. Any type of herbicide should be used cautiously, as they have the potential to kill desirable plants as well, potentially even ones planted in neighboring gardens. Match your herbicide to your type of weed, and check that it does not have any harmful effects on your specific vegetable crops. Use these guidelines to begin your research:  Herbicides containing trifluralin can be used to control grass weeds, but these are banned in the European Union. Herbicides with sethoxidym, including Poast, can also be used to control grass weeds.  Herbicides containing glyphosate, including Roundup, kill many plants, weeds and otherwise, and should only be used in a vegetable garden if the label specifically provides instructions for it.",
      ". If you are prepared to use high-quality soil, and water frequently, a raised bed will allow you to keep your vegetables spaced closer together. This makes it harder for weeds to compete, and the raised level may make weeds easier to spot as well.  Plants warm up more quickly in a raised bed. This is an advantage in many climates, but if the climate is on the hot side for your vegetables, consider digging a lowered bed instead. Sometimes referred to as intensive planting, keeping vegetables closer together gives weeds less room to grow. However, spacing is limited by your soil quality, watering frequency, and vegetable variety. You can often plant vegetables a couple inches (a few centimeters) closer than recommended on the seed packet, but it's best to attempt this by planting slightly closer each year, reversing the practice if the vegetables fail to grow quickly and healthily. Try looking up your vegetable's recommended spacing if using a raised bed. Due to the trapped heat in the soil, this method is only recommended for certain vegetables, such as tomato, pepper, eggplant, cucumber, melon, or squash. Lay a covering of black plastic over the soil in your vegetable garden prior to planting. Cut out holes where the vegetable  plants will grow through the plastic.  Keep an eye out for aggressive weeds that may continue to grow under the plastic or through the holes for the vegetable plants. Plastic will not decompose, and must be thrown away after the growing season. Alternatively, you can use black landscaping fabric. This allows water to penetrate down into the soil and is reusable.",
      "Whenever you notice weeds start to emerge, use a stirrup hoe, garden tiller, or rake to disturb the soil around their roots. Exposing their roots, especially on a dry, hot day, can cause the weeds to dry up and die. Cultivating further than a couple inches (3-5 centimeters) is not recommended, as it can damage vegetable roots and bring buried weed seeds to the surface. This method will be less effective if the weeds are allowed to grow larger. Mulch refers to any material covering the soil surface, which helps block new plants from emerging. Add a 2–4 inch (5–10 cm) layer of dead leaves, seed-free straw, or grass clippings to serve as mulch, but leave bare areas 1 inch (2.5 cm) around each desirable plant to allow air circulation.  Mulch also helps retain soil moisture and heat. As an insulator, it can help keep plants cool in hot temperatures, and warm in cooler temperatures. Avoid wood chips, bark chips, or sawdust, as they may have lingering effects that prohibit seed growth. These types of mulch may be appropriate for use in area of your gardens without vegetables or other annual plants. If you are using wood then make sure to inspect it for parasites and diseases. You don't want to introduce these to your garden. Black-and-white newspaper can be used as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly mulch to prevent weed growth, but it is only effective in certain conditions. This relatively recent practice requires more study, but appears to require well-draining soil, and frequent cultivation as described above. Apply it as you would organic mulch, described above.   Do not use colored ink pages, which may contain toxic materials that can harm the soil and vegetable plants. In windy conditions, weigh the newspaper down with grass clippings or other material. Always research a herbicide's effect on your specific vegetables and nearby plants before using, and select one that targets your type of weed (such as grass or broad-leaf weeds). Here is some information to start with, concerning pre-emergent herbicides to use before the weeds have sprouted:   Products containing DCPA, such as Dacthal, rarely harm most vegetables.  Corn gluten meal is sometimes used as organic weed control, applied in a garden with vegetables 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) tall and no weeds present. It is unclear how effective this is compared to other options, but can double as a fertilizer as well. Rather than leave your garden bare after harvesting, plant a cover crop to prevent undesirable plants from going wild. Grow a hardy winter/autumn crop such as annual rye grass, buckwheat, or winter rye for this purpose. Be prepared to fertilize and harvest this crop if you go with this plan.  A dense crop cover will keep weeds from getting started in your garden. When you cut the cover crop, you can even leave the trimmings in your garden as a green manure. Look up crop rotation or crop combination recommendations for your specific vegetables, so your soil next year will have the correct nutrients to encourage vegetable growth."

      "Write down a few of the things that you like to do for fun. Next, write down a few items that you'd use for that hobby. Choose the ones you really like from that list, and add them to your wish list. Here are some ideas to get you started:  If you like to paint or draw, you might need some new graphite pencils, paintbrushes, or paints. If you do oil painting, you might also need some linseed oil or turpentine. Be creative! If you like to show support for your favorite sports team, don't limit yourself to just jerseys, sweatshirts, and hats with your favorite team's logo. A sports game is a great way of showing support. It can also be a great experience. If you like music, why not think about your favorite bands? Are there any new albums that came out or that you don't have? What about posters or shirts? If you are interested in manga or comic books, see if any new volumes have been added to your favorite series. If you like anime, see what new action figures you might have missed out on. Click here for more ideas on specific gifts. Did you recently see a musical that you really liked? The musical might not be playing anymore by the time your birthday rolls around, but there could be another one that you might enjoy. Visit the theater company's website and see what is coming up that interests you. Tickets to performances, such as operas, plays, and musicals, make great, memorable gifts. If you don't like theater, think about other things you have enjoyed. This could be a sports game, a concert, or even a theme park. Click here for more gift ideas based on experiences. Sometimes, figuring out what you need is easier than deciding what you want. Think about the past few months. Ask yourself if there was something you really needed at one point but didn't have. Here are some things to get you started:  If you cook a lot, you might find that some of your pots, pans, and other utensils need replacing or updating. You could ask for a new set or blender. If all your cooking gear is in top condition, consider some exotic spices instead. If you have a green thumb, you might like a grow-your-own herb kit. You'll get some pots, soil, and a few popular cooking herbs, such as basil, thyme, and mint. If you play a sport or music, see if your gear needs updating or replacing. Equipment can be expensive, and a birthday is a great chance to get an upgrade. If your birthday is close to winter, it might be a good idea to check and see if your winter clothes still fit. If they don't, you could ask for a new jacket or scarf. Do you have a favorite store that you like to shop in? Visit their website and see if there is anything new that came out since the last time you visited. Sometimes, walking through a store, thumbing through a catalog, or surfing the web may give you some ideas. If you have a free weekend, try visiting your local mall. Be sure to take note of anything that interests you.",
      "Chances are, you might be interested in more than one thing, such as drawing, painting, and knitting. You might also find yourself wanting anything and everything related to your craft. This could easily get overwhelming. To keep this from happening, you could always ask for a set or kit. They usually contain everything you need to complete a project or two. This would also make it easier on your friends and family when they go gift-shopping; they won't have to worry about getting the right supplies or missing an important one. Here are some ideas to get you started:  If you like beading, you might like a beading set. Most will have everything you need to create a necklace, a pair of earrings, and a bracelet. They will come with beading wire, clasps and crimps, and beads. You might also be interested in getting some polymer clay so that you can make your own beads. If you are into DIY, you might like a soap or candle-making kit. You could also ask for supplies for a basic DIY project, such as chalkboard paint, mason jars, burlap, twine, and paint brushes. If you like to draw, you could ask for a set of graphite or charcoal pencils, a sketchbook, and a how-to-draw book. These books come on just about every subject, from people to plants and trees to animals. Some even focus on specific animals, such as birds, cats, dogs, or horses. If you like fantasy creatures, then there are books on how to draw mermaids, fairies, elves, and dragons. There are even books on how to draw anime. If you like to paint, consider an art set. Many arts and crafts stores sell sets that come in wooden or metal cases. You can get them with artist-grade acrylic, oil, or watercolor paints. Some sets may also including a how-to-paint book, some art paper, or a canvas. If you like knitting or crochet, you don't have to limit yourself to just plain old yarn. You would treat yourself to some fancier, more expensive yarn with different fibers and textures. There are also many pattern books available that you might like as well. Things like computers, phones, and tablets are always updating, and what is new one year will be old and outdated the next. Accessories, such as cases and earphones, however, won't get old as fast and could last you much longer. Here are some ideas:  If you have a phone or tablet, ask for a protective case. They can often be personalized with your name, a design, or an image. Headphones, speakers and other smaller items can enhance a device you already have. You might also like something nostalgic, such as a new turntable to play your record collection. Jewelry can be expensive, but it doesn't have to be. You can get many beautiful, handmade pieces on artist websites, such as Etsy, and at craft fairs. Look through your jewelry collection and see if there anything you wish you to complete an outfit, such as a brooch, bracelet, or necklace. If jewelry isn't your thing, you could always ask for a special hat or bag. Here's a few more ideas for you:  When asking for jewelry, consider getting a full set: a necklace and matching earrings. If you already have a lot of jewelry but nothing to keep it in, you could ask for a jewelry box instead. If you are a man, you can always ask for a tie pin, cuff-links, or even a new watch. Belts and wallets can make great gifts. If you get them in leather, you might be able to get them customized; some leather can be stamped with a design or letters. Just be sure to list your favorite colors, shades, and scents as these can be personal. Like jewelry, makeup does not take up a lot of space, and it can be used almost very day. Here are some ideas to get you started:  Many makeup companies offer gift sets that include a makeup bag, eye shadow, lipstick, and blush. Bath and beauty stores often offer gift baskets that include lotion and soap. Some even include things like bath bombs, salts, and bubbles. If you like to use expensive moisturizers or perfumes, your birthday is a great chance to ask for these. Most sports teams have online gift shops. They are a great place to start looking. If your favorite team is playing near your town around your birthday, see if you can get a ticket to their game. Here are some more ideas:  Ask for jersey, hat, or sweatshirt that you can wear to games to show your support. If you want to show your support in the workplace, try searching for business-appropriate attire instead, such as: a necktie, socks, cuff-links, or a scarf. If you like to host parties to watch, ask for things like a themed bowl. They could add a personal touch to your party. You could also ask for items that would allow you to play a sport, such as athletic apparel, specialized shoes, rackets, or balls. If you have a favorite author or genre, ask for the latest book in a series. The New York Times bestseller list can help you find the most popular books in a variety of genres. Let the giver know what your tastes. Maybe he or she has read something you would enjoy. Here are some more ideas:  Ask for an e-reader; this will allow you to carry all your favorite books, wherever you go.  If you already own an e-reader, ask for a special cover for your reader. You can also ask for a gift certificate so that you can buy more e-books. If you have a favorite book, see if you can find a canvas book bag or a poster that features the cover. You might even find a print of the book cover on a shirt, mug, or even mouse pad. If you have a favorite quote about reading or from a favorite author, look online to see if it is available on a poster, mug or other object. If you already own a few figures from a certain set, ask for more figures so that you can finish your collection. If you like playing games, you might like board games or card games like Uno, Clue, or Apples to Apples.  Older players may enjoy strategy games like Ticket to Ride, or parlor games like Cards Against Humanity. You might also be interested in model kits. Some are simple, and only require you to snap together the parts. There is no glue or painting involved. Some kits are more advanced; you have to glue the parts together and paint them. You can buy models kits of cars, airplanes, ships, helicopters, and motorcycles. You could even buy space ships from popular science fiction films, such as Star Wars and Star Trek. If you like a show, book series, or video game, you could ask for merchandise from that. For example, you could ask for a wand from Harry Potter, a figure or model from Lord of the Rings or a t-shirt from your favorite video game. You might also want to add to your collection of DVDs or books. Here are a few more ideas:  Fans of video games may enjoy a Minecraft backpack or pajamas with the Crest of Hyrule from the Legend of Zelda.  If you like to cosplay, you could ask for a wig or accessories to finish your latest work. You can also ask for a gift card to your favorite fabric or arts and crafts store so that you can buy materials to make your cosplay.  Ask for posters or action figures of your favorite character, comic book, movie, or video game. If you like to read manga, ask for the newest books in the series. If you like anime, ask for the latest episodes on a DVD; some studios also make movies based on the series. Consider getting a book featuring the artwork and concept art from your favorite video game, comic book, manga, or anime. These gifts are often more personal and special than store-bought gifts. The person might even be flattered that you think their talents are gift-worthy. Handmade gifts are both unique and special, and sure to stand out. Here are some things you could ask for:  If you know someone who likes to knit, see if they are willing to make you a scarf or hat. If you know someone who sews, see if they might be willing to make you a new bag. If one of your friends likes to make soaps or candles, see if they could make you a set. Sometimes, your favorite store may not be carrying something that you like at the moment. A gift card will allow you to set money aside to spend at that store when you do find something that you like. Some people do not like giving gift cards. If this happens, ask them if they could go with you to the store to buy that special gift when the time comes.",
      "If you can't decide between a few items, make a pro and con list. Write down the good things and the bad things about each item on your list. Choose the item that has the most advantages and the fewest disadvantages. For example, a jacket may not be very exciting, but you could wear it with many different outfits; it may also keep you warm in the wintertime. It might be school, a job, sports, or something else entirely. If playing sports are the most important thing for you, new equipment might be more useful than that new video game—which you may not have the time to play between practices. Sometimes, what you want right now may not be what you will want (or use) later on down the road. If you can't decide between a few items, try to imagine your life without each of those items a few months later. Choose the item that you will continue to use, or still be interested in, over those whose novelty will fade. You can also try imagining what it would be like not to get one of these gifts. Choose the one you'd be most upset over not getting. Not everyone might be able to spend a lot of money on a gift. If you want something very expensive, try asking the person for a budget before posting your wish list. If you ask for something that the person is unable to afford, he or she might feel embarrassed. Here are some other options:  If you are too shy to ask for a budget, put a few expensive and inexpensive things on your wish list. This will let people buy what is within their budget. Ask for a group gift. This will allow everyone in your family or circle of friends to chip in when the time comes to buy that expensive gift. Ask for a gift that doubles up for another occasion. For example, if your birthday is in the winter, you could ask for a gift that is both a birthday and Christmas present Offer to pay for part of it yourself. The combination of your money and theirs may allow you to get something expensive that you really want. If you cannot decide between two or three things, ask someone else to choose for you. Give that person the list, and tell him or her to choose one item from that list. Some people may even prefer being able to choose a gift for you. If you try to meet other people's expectations, you will end up getting stressed. You may also end up not getting something that you really wanted. If the trip to the beach is what would really make you happy, let your family know. You do not have to choose an expensive gift for your birthday, just because all your friends do on theirs.",
      "If the budget is large, you might ask to go on a trip to a place you’ve never been to. If the budget is more limited, ask to spend a day with the giver. It can be as simple as going out to a meal or to a museum in your town. Here's some more ideas:  Visit another country or state you have always wanted to go to. If you don't know where to go, you could always close your eyes and point to a spot on a map. Open your eyes, and visit wherever your finger is pointing to. Go on a cruise. Oftentimes, cruises also allow you to go on land and tour; you are not always stuck on a boat. Go to the park. It can be as simple as your local neighborhood park. It can also be a state or national park. Go camping. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to go camping alone, so you might want to bring a buddy or two. Much like traveling, these sorts of experiences need some planning. In many cases, they will also need some equipment as well. They can, however, be combined with traveling. For example, if you go to a tropical island, you might also want to try scuba diving. If you decide to go camping, you might also want to try visiting some caves or go hiking. Here's some more ideas for you to consider:  Bungee jumping Caving Hiking or backpacking Horseback riding Kayaking Rock climbing Scuba diving Many spas offer extra-special treatments, such as fancy pedicures complete with salts, oils, and an extra long massage. If you don't like pedicures, you might like a massage or a facial with a mud mask. Be sure to schedule your appointment in advance, as some of the more popular spa centers get their spots filled up fast. Many businesses offer gift certificates to learn a new skill, such as dancing, martial arts, painting, or woodworking. You can also see if you can spend the day learning a special skill from a family member. Your grandmother may be delighted to teach you how to bake a cake or cook a favorite dish. And the best part is that you can eat what you cook after you are done. Here are some more ideas:  If you like beading, cake decorating, crochet, knitting, or painting, visit an arts and crafts store. Many of them offer classes in these areas. Some community centers also offer classes in areas such as pottery, weaving, and music. They are great gifts for those who enjoy art or history. Many museums are themed, and focus on a certain type of history (such as ancient Egyptian or Medieval) or a certain type of art (such as Asian or French Impressionist). Think about what interests you, and see if there is a museum that features your interests. If history or art aren't your think, you might be interested in a sports or music hall of fame. You might also enjoy visiting a wax museum or a museum that focuses on technology and innovation. Most of the time, you only have to pay an entrance fee, and can spend as much time as you want. Some zoos and aquariums may allow you to get up close and personal with some of the animals for an additional fee. If you are interested in this, visit your local zoo or aquarium's website, and see if this is an option. Sometimes, the memories of an event can outlast any physical gift. Many theaters and concert halls may also have gift shops that sell posters, CDs, and shirts that you can buy to help you remember the experience even more.  See if your favorite band is playing close to you, and ask for a ticket to their concert. You can make the experience even more special by asking for a VIP pass, so that you can meet your favorite band members and have them sign items for you. If you like classical music, you might be interested in attending a concert with a live orchestra. If you like singing and dancing, you might enjoy watching a musical. If you like performing arts, but without the singing or dancing, try a play instead. Keep in mind, however, that if this convention is out of town, and if you will be staying there overnight, you may need a place to stay there. Many hotels that host the conventions offer special prices on rooms.  If anime or comic books aren't your thing, you might be interested in a Renaissance Faire instead. They are usually open only on weekends, so you do not need to stay there overnight. They are a great way to immerse yourself in history and fantasy. If you have a favorite author or illustrator, see if he or she is holding a reading or signing in your area. Not only will you be able to meet someone you adore, but you may also walk away with an autograph. An experience doesn't always have to be active. It can also be as simple as enjoying good food with friends and family. Choose a restaurant that you love, or that you have always wanted to go to. Sometimes, the gift of giving may feel more rewarding than the gift of receiving. Think about some things that you are passionate about, and try to find an organization that supports that. Here are some ideas:  Animals and nature The homeless Disaster relief Education"

      "Take the time to get to know your camera and ensure that you are using it properly. Read the manual to learn what each control, switch, button, and menu item does. Learn the basic actions, such as using the flash (on, off, and auto), zooming in and out, and using the shutter button.    If you can find an online tutorial for your camera or a video, then this might be helpful as well. If you don't yet have a good camera, do research to ensure you buy one that works for you. The way that you hold your camera may make a difference in the quality of your shots. It is important to hold your camera with both hands so that you have the most control over it. Hold it so that you are supporting the lens with your left hand and holding the camera body with your right hand.  This position will make it easier to keep your camera steady, take pictures quickly, and adjust your settings if necessary. You can also try holding your elbows close to your body to help steady the camera. If you have a hard time keeping your camera steady enough to photograph your subjects, then you might find it helpful to get a tripod. A tripod will keep your camera steady while still allowing you to adjust it to different angles. You might consider getting a low-cost tripod to start out with. You can also get mini-tripods that adjust so that you can place them on table tops and photograph from lower angles. Low-resolution images don’t look as good as high-resolution pictures, and they’re more difficult to alter after the fact. To ensure that you are getting the best quality photos possible, change your camera’s settings so that you are taking high-resolution photos.  Keep in mind that higher resolution photos take up a considerable amount of memory, so you may need to get a larger memory card to accommodate this change. Most digital cameras have an easy automatic mode that will change your camera’s settings based on the type of subject you are photographing. For example, the camera may detect that you are taking a portrait of someone in low light and adjust the settings to get the best image. Try using your camera’s automatic setting to make it easier to take better photos.  If your photos come out poorly focused or poorly exposed, then start operating certain functions manually. For portraits, using an anti-red eye mode may be helpful.",
      "Taking time to think about the composition of your shot is also important. This means thinking about the story that you want to tell about your subject or subjects.  For example, if you are photographing a man sitting on a bench in a park, what is his story? Is he waiting for someone? Is he sad? Happy? Concerned? What else is happening that is relevant to this man? How can you frame your subject to tell this story? If you want to portray the man as lonely, then you might choose to frame him in such a way that no other people will be in the shot. You might also look for interesting things in the background or foreground to help tell your story about the man. For example, framing the shot so that a statue of woman is in the background might help to make him seem like he is lonely. Investigate your surroundings and experiment with different angles and ranges to frame your shot and tell your story. Shooting with something in the foreground or background can help to add dimension to your photos. If you want your subject to seem small, then you might place something in the foreground of the shot. If you want your subject to look large, then you might place something in the background.For example, you might take a picture of someone standing on a beach, but photograph the person from far away with a seashell in the foreground. Or, you might photograph the person from a closer vantage point, but capture a seemingly endless white beach in the background. Sometimes photos do not look as good as they could because you are too far away from your subject. If you notice that the details of your subject are hard to make out, then try moving a little closer. For example, if you took your first shot while standing 10 feet (3.0 m) away, then take the next one from 5 feet (1.5 m) away. Keep checking your shots and adjusting your distance until you have captured the desired amount of detail in your shot.",
      "Sometimes natural light from the sun can be too harsh for portraits. It may cause your subject to look washed out or cast harsh shadows and make it hard to see the details of a person’s face. One way to adapt when your light is too harsh is to photograph your subject in the shade.Keep in mind that photographing your subject in the shade may create a cooler effect than photographing your subject in an unshaded area. Many people only use the flash in dim light. However, if you only use the flash in low light, then you may not be getting the best possible pictures. Your flash can be especially useful when the sun is shining brightly, such as around midday. Bright midday sunlight may result in harsh shadows and unappealing photos, and the flash can help offset this problem.  By using your flash when the light is strong, you can diffuse harsh shadows. This may result in more pleasing photos. Keep in mind that you do not always need to use the flash, especially if the natural lighting is good. However, you might want to try taking photos with and without the flash to see what works best for the light you have available. Red eye is caused by the camera’s flash reflecting off of the subject’s retinas. This usually happens when you are taking photos in low light and your subject’s pupils don’t have enough time to constrict. To avoid getting a red eye effect, you can try:  Turning on more lights. If you are taking pictures indoors, then you can prevent the red eye effect by turning on as many lights as you can and making the environment brighter. Telling your subjects to look away from the camera. If your subjects are not looking directly at the camera, then you can avoid the red-eye reflection. Turning on the red-eye function. Most digital cameras have this feature and it can help to prevent red-eye shots."

      "Having three Electrics and three Fire type Pokémon, no matter how strong, is going to mean trouble when you run into a Ground Pokémon. You want a wide variety of types so that you don't have any of the same types of Pokémon in your arsenal. This is the biggest key to a balanced team, and this will get you through just about every single battle. Think about the roles your Pokémon play. While you want mostly \"Sweepers\" (strong, attacking Pokémon), you should get at least one \"Wall,\" like Snorlax or Blissey, (lots of HP and defense) to help you heal everyone in a time of need. Probably one of the most important types, electric Pokémon are weak against only Ground, but are resisted by Grass and Dragon type Pokémon. They can learn a large variety of moves. You can catch a Shinx early in the game, and it's evolved form, Luxray, can be an indispensable member of your team.  Try Electivire or Raichu if you don't want a Luxray. If you can catch the Legendary Bird Zapdos then you will be well armed for the challenges ahead.  Use moves like Thunderbolt, Thunder, and Thunder Fang. Water Pokémon can use Ice moves and only have two weaknesses, Electric and Grass. However, since Ice moves are effective against both Grass and Dragon types and work normally against Electric Pokémon, Water Pokémon are incredibly useful, and HM Surf is actually powerful. If you didn't start with Piplup, you can try:  Floatzel, Gyarados, or Vaporeon. Utilize moves like Surf, Waterfall, Hydro Pump. These rare but powerful Pokémon are invaluable to your arsenal, especially a Pokémon that can learn both types of moves. You will be good against other Psychics, Bugs, Poison, and other Dark Pokémon. More importantly, these Pokémon usually have a high Sp. Attack and a lot of special moves.  Metagross, Alakazam, Espeon, Gallade and Hypno are all Psychic or Dark types. Get moves like Psychic, Night Slash, Bite and Psycho Cut. Many of these Pokémon share types and can learn moves from each set, making them viable against a variety of Pokémon. They also cross frequently with other types, making the even more versatile. Fighting types are usually quite frail, while Rock and Ground types are usually quite bulky.  Mamoswine, Bastiodon, Golem, Infernape and Lucario are examples of Fighting types. Use Earthquake, Rockslide, Rock Smash, and Close Combat when possible. Grass Pokémon, though weak to a lot of types, have a wide and powerful moveset that makes them great in certain situations. Roserade is generally the most common, as it can learn Psychic and Poison moves and has a high Special Attack.  Tropius, Torterra, Carnivine and Venusaur are all grass-type Pokémon.  Use moves like Giga Drain, Energy Ball, and Leaf Blade. Since there are unfortunately not many Fire-types in Platinum, snag a Ponyta early in the game that you can level up to the quick, powerful Rapidash. If you chose Chimchar to start, he will be able to get you out of just about every mess needing Fire Pokémon, including almost every gym. You will also be super effective against Grass, Ice, Bug, Rock and Steel types.  Legendary Bird Moltres is a great choice as well if you can get your hands on one. You can get an Eevee in Hearthome City in the house above the Pokémon Center. This Pokémon can evolve into a Fire, Water, Electric, Psychic, Dark, Grass, or Ice type if you have the requirements completed. Learn moves like Flare Blitz, Fire Blast, and Sunny Day.  Fire Pokémon are not strictly necessary -- a good Fighting Pokémon can often compensate for a missing Fire type. There is an online generator that lets you plug your team in to see it's stats. It will tell you where you are weakest and offer suggestions to fill the hole. Some good Pokémon to consider are:  Flying Pokémon, like the powerful and popular Staraptor (must know Fly and Close Combat).  Any Legendary Pokémon. These are the Pokémon that only appear once in each game, like Mewtwo or Latios. They are incredibly powerful and will be a valuable asset on any team.  Try Giratina. It is a Ghost and Dragon type of Pokemon, so you get the advantages of Dark type moves and Dragon type ones that have a wide variety of effectiveness and low weaknesses. Find Heatran, a strong Fire and Steel type Pokémon that works well if you need some heat. While having the right types of Pokémon is essential to survive against any type of Pokémon you face, you won't be able to succeed offensively without the right move set. Just like you need to balance your Pokémon types, you need to balance the types of moves you have to fight well against anyone.  You want to balance offensive and defensive moves in every Pokémon. STAB moves give you a 50% attack bonus if the type of move (ie. a Fire Move, like Ember) matches the Pokémon's type (ie. Infernape, a Fire Pokémon, using Ember). When possible, teach Pokémon moves that match their type.",
      "The first Pokémon you get in the game will, in many ways, determine how the rest of your team develops. You have three options to begin, the water-based Piplup, the fire-based Chimchar, and the grass-based Turtwig.   Piplup grows into a water/steel hybrid Pokémon, and can learn ice moves as well. Because it is both water and steel, he has very few weaknesses and can learn a variety of useful moves, making his evolved form very powerful. Often seen as the best possible starter.   Turtwig is slow, but has great attack and defense and functions well against almost every gym leader in the game. He is a good pick for entry-level players.   Chimchar becomes a fire-fighting hybrid, which makes him useful in a lot of scenarios and useful in almost every gym. Platinum has less fire Pokémon than other games, so Chimchar is a good choice if you want to save the hassle of looking for other fire Pokémon. The main concern when building a team is making sure you are not weak to any one type of Pokémon. That is because the game is built on a complex \"rock-paper-scissors\" system where one type of Pokémon will get an advantage over another based on type. For example, Fire attacks are effective against Grass Pokémon, and their moves do twice as much damage. The inverse is also true, as a Grass attack will only do half its normal damage to a fire Pokémon. Attacks of the same type will only do half damage as well in most scenarios (Flying attacks against flying types do not have any extra effectiveness.) A complete table of effectiveness can be found on the Pokémon Database.  A status move will have the same effect no matter what type it is used on. Most effectiveness is based on logic -- Flying beats Bug (because birds eat bugs), Water beats Fire, Steel beats Rock, etc. A Fire-type Pokémon who uses a Normal-type move, like Tackle, will not be effective against Grass-type Pokémon. It will do normal damage as Normal-type moves aren't super effective against Grass types in most scenarios. However, if a Pokémon has an ability like 'Pixilate' which turns certain typed moves to another type, this may be the case. Some moves will do no damage whatsoever to the right type. For example, a Ground attack will never hurt a Flying Pokémon. Longtime players have developed a lingo around certain Pokémon that makes it easier to think about building teams. These terms don't refer to a type of Pokémon, like Fire or Ghost, but rather the function of the Pokémon.   Sweeper: The most common Pokémon in your team, sweepers are powerful offensive Pokémon used for dealing damage and taking out the enemy. You will likely have 3-4 in your team of 6, and some players want 5-6. Try Alakazam, a Legendary Pokémon, Metagross, Luxray, Scizor.   Wall These Pokémon have high HP (health points) and defense. They can survive a lot of damage while you use items to heal up the rest of your team, making them invaluable for staying in the fight. Sometimes called \"Tanks.\" Try Shuckle, Steelix, Bastiodon, Torterra, Rhyhorn, Aggron or Blissey.   Support: These Pokémon use a variety of stat-boosting (for themselves) or stat-depleting (for your enemy) moves to weaken the opposing team. For stat boosts, they need to know the move \"Baton Pass,\" which gives the next Pokémon you sub in the same stat boosts that you just used.Try Raichu, Sandslash or Umbreon   HM 'Slave': Generally not used for fighting, HM Slaves are sometimes used for travel, as they can learn a variety of moves like Surf, Fly, Strength, etc. that are essential for moving the game along. They are usually subbed in and out when needed, not used for battles. Try Linoone, Charizard or Bibarel.   Catcher: This Pokémon, usually not used in battles, is used to catch new Pokémon in the wild. They usually have a mixture of powerful moves, some neutral, weak moves, and sometimes Sleep or Paralyze to make a Pokémon easier to catch. They almost always know the move False Swipe. Try a Scyther, Farfetch'd, Raticate or Gallade. Different attacks do different damage based on your stats, and knowing how the stats work will help you craft an effective team. For example, if you have a Sweeper who uses mostly Special Attacks, like Luxray, you want to make sure it has a high Special Attack. If you are fighting a trainer with lots of Physical Attacks, like a rock gym, sub in a Pokémon with a high defense stat, like Shuckle.   Attack: Affects the power of a physical attack such as Scratch or Tackle.  Special Attack: Refers to mental or indirect attacks, like beam attack or environmental attacks. All non-physical attacking moves utilize the Special Attack stat.  Defense: Determines the amount of damage taken by a physical attack.  Special Defense: Determines the amount of damage taken by special attacks.  Speed: Determines who attacks first. Speed stats are compared between the two fighting Pokémon and the fastest Pokémon attacks first. In a tie, it is chosen randomly. You will need a team with all the Pokémon around this level in order to compete against the best trainers in the game, specifically the final bosses, the Elite 4. Leveling up increases your stats, teaches your Pokémon new moves, and gives you the chance to evolve your Pokémon into stronger forms."

      "If you have gout, a type of arthritis from high uric acid levels, crystals can form in the fluid around your joints. Although older men are more likely to get it, it can affect anyone. No one knows the true cause of gout, but certain risk factors include a diet high in meat and seafood, obesity, chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, family history of gout or if you are on certain medications. Gout causes inflammation and attacks of joint pain (usually at night and experienced in your big or great toe), along with redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the joint. The discomfort lingers for days to weeks after the attack ends and could actually develop into chronic gout, leading to impaired mobility. If you have chronic gout, frequent or painful gout attacks, talk to your doctor about starting a prescription medication. Your doctor may do different tests to diagnose gout, including a blood test to measure your uric acid levels, a synovial fluid test (where a needle draws fluid from your joint), or an ultrasound or CT scan to detect urate crystals. With the results of the tests, your doctor will be able to decide if and which medication you should start. Your doctor may prescribe medications like xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uricosuric drugs, and other less common drugs such as colchicine, which is for acute gout attacks. These medications decrease the amount of uric acid your body makes which can lower your blood uric acid level. Your doctor will most likely prescribe these medications as a first form of treatment for chronic gout. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors include allopurinol (Aloprim, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric). While these medications can cause an initial increase in gout attacks, they'll eventually prevent them.   Side effects of allopurinol include diarrhea, drowsiness, rash and low blood counts. Make sure to drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day when taking allopurinol. Side effects of febuxostat include rash, nausea, joint pain and reduced liver function. These types of medications help your body to excrete more uric acid through your urine. Uricosuric drugs prevent your body from reabsorbing urate (uric crystals) back into your blood, which can reduce the concentration of uric acid in your blood. You'll probably be prescribed probenecid, but it's not recommended if you have kidney issues. Start by taking 250mg every 12 hours for the first week. Your doctor may increase the prescription over time, but never to more than 2 grams (0.071 oz). Side effects of probenecid include rash, stomach pain, kidney stones, dizziness, and headache. To prevent kidney stones, you should drink at least six to eight full glasses of water a day while taking probenecid. Some medications, including thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), and loop diuretics (such as furosemide or Lasix) should be avoided, since they can aggravate your condition. You should also avoid low doses of aspirin and niacin because they can also increase your uric acid levels. Don't stop taking medications without talking to your doctor. In many cases, there are alternatives available.",
      "Try to eat healthy, fiber-rich foods and lean proteins. Foods that are high in dietary soluble fiber can help to dissolve uric acid crystals. The fiber helps to absorb the crystals, removing them from your joints and helping to eliminate them from your kidneys. You should also avoid saturated fats, like cheese, butter and margarine. Reduce your sugar intake, including high-fructose corn syrup and soft drinks, all of which can promote gout attacks. Instead try to include:  Oats Spinach Broccoli Raspberries Whole-wheat items Brown rice Black beans Cherries (Cherries can reduce gout attacks. One study showed that eating 10 cherries a day protected people from gout flare ups.) Low-fat or non-fat dairy Naturally occurring substances in food called purines are converted to uric acid by your body. Studies have shown that eating foods high in purines could lead to a gout attack within a few days of eating the foods. Avoid high-purine foods including:  Meats: red meat and organ meats (liver, kidney and sweetbreads) Seafood: tuna, lobster, shrimp, mussels, anchovies, herring, sardines, scallops, trout, haddock, mackerel Drinking six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day has been shown to decrease gout attacks. Liquids generally count toward water recommendations, but it's best to stick to water. You should also minimize or cut out drinking alcohol since it can metabolize and increase uric acid levels. If you do want to drink something other than water, look for drinks that aren't high in sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, or caffeinated. Sugar can increase your risk of gout and caffeine can be dehydrating. You can still drink coffee in moderation (two to three cups a day). Some studies show that coffee may reduce the levels of uric acid in your blood, although the studies do not show a decrease in gout attacks. Some studies show that vitamin C may reduce the levels of uric acid in your blood, although the studies do not show a decrease in gout attacks. It's suggested that vitamin C can help your kidneys excrete uric acid. Consider taking a 500 mg daily supplement after consulting your doctor. If you'd rather increase your vitamin C through your diet, try eating:  Fruits: cantaloupe, citrus, kiwi fruit, mango, papaya, pineapple, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries, watermelon Vegetables: broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, green and red peppers, spinach, cabbage, turnip greens, sweet potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, winter squash Cereals fortified with vitamin C Try to exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. One study showed that exercising 150 minutes a week reduces uric acid levels. It can also reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and help you lose weight. Weight loss has been linked to lower blood uric acid levels. Even lower physical activity has been linked to some reduction in uric acid levels. For example, if you can't jog for 30 minutes, try briskly walking for at least 15."

      "One of a nurse's main jobs is to take direct care of patients.  You’ll likely see these people at their worst.  Nurses need to understand that their patients are human beings that are probably stressed, scared, depressed, upset, in pain, and confused.  This understanding requires the ability to be compassionate and empathetic.  Being able to put yourself in your patient’s shoes will help you understand what she's going through, and what she needs from you.  Often times, because a patient sees nurses most often, those nurses get the brunt of any anger the patient is feeling.  Being compassionate and empathetic means you do not take this anger personally.  Patients are likely sick or injured and not having a very good day!  Understanding that some patients may need to release their anger in order to reduce their stress or fear is what being compassionate is all about. In addition to patients, nurses often deal with the family and friends of their patients.  Being compassionate and empathetic means being able to show those family members and friends that you truly do care about your patient and are doing your absolute best to help her.  The following six steps can help you learn to be a more compassionate person: Step 1: Listen without judgement or formulating an immediate response. Try to understand the person's feelings, needs, and wants so that you can formulate a plan to best help her. Step 2: Reply back to the speaker based on her emotions and not her words.  For example, mean and angry words are likely a sign of someone who is scared or fearful. Step 3: Make sure you have someone who is compassionate to you.  This means having your own support system at or outside of work.  If you have a million problems on your mind, it may be harder to care about the problems of others. Step 4: Think about the whole person, not just who she is at that very moment.  You’re going to see many people at their worst, but that’s not who they really are.  Remember that there is much more to your patients than just what you see. Step 5: Think about a time when you were in a similar situation.  You may have an actual memory of your own you can borrow from, or you may simply need to imagine yourself in that situation.  Think about all the emotions you went through (or would go through) and how you felt (or would feel) in that situation. Step 6: Be able to forgive yourself for failure.  In essence, have some compassion for yourself.  You’re not going to be perfect.  You’re going to make mistakes.  But you’re human, and that’s normal.  Don’t beat yourself up. Being a nurse means you’re going to see people at their very worst.  You’ll likely have to take care of patients who are about to die.  You may need to take care of patients in an extreme amount of pain.  You may need to take care of patients who have just been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness.  Constantly being around people who are suffering can take an emotional toll on you.  As a nurse you need to be able to control your emotions while you’re on the job, and not allow those emotions to cloud your judgement or slow your reaction time.  Being emotionally stable doesn’t mean keeping all your emotions bottled-up forever.  It means knowing when the time is right for letting those emotions out.  And allowing yourself that emotional release on a regular basis. Try exercise, time with friends, yoga, reading, and developing hobbies. Emotional stability also doesn’t mean developing an ice-cold personality where you do not allow yourself to care about anything.  You need to allow yourself to care about your patients in order to provide them with compassion and empathy. Having, or being able to have, emotional stability may mean you have to do certain things outside of work so you’re able to control your emotions at work.  One helpful way to develop stable emotions and have better control over your mood is to practice mindfulness. This means being in the moment without thinking about the past, the future, or anything judgmental. Being a responsible nurse means not cutting any corners.  Not allowing yourself to make an error, but if you do, making sure the proper people know about the error you made and making sure it’s corrected as soon as possible.  Being responsible also means using your best judgement when evaluating a patients' needs and making good decisions that are in the best interests of your patients. If you are a nurse that works in an emergency room or an operating room, or something similar, you also need to be responsible with your time.  You need to understand that things do not always go as planed, and emergencies do not happen on a schedule that matches your shifts.  A good nurse is prepared to work longer if necessary and understand that’s just part of the job. . In addition to being compassionate, empathetic, and sympathetic to your patients and their needs, you also need to be respectful and non-judgemental about the decisions your patient has made in life.  It is not up to you, as a nurse, to judge your patients.  It is up to you to help them and make sure they leave you care in the best possible condition — regardless of how they may have ended up in your care in the first place.  It also means not treating patients differently because of their backgrounds, ethnicity, or personality.  A homeless man who is being treated for a drug overdose deserves just as much respect from you as a pregnant woman who has been hit by a car. Being respectful of your patients also means being truthful with them.  When communicating news — good or bad — you need to understand that the patient has the right to honesty.  Be straight-forward with your patients, but do it respectfully and with compassion. Keeping calm means maintaining your level-headedness.  It means having confidence in what you’re doing and the decisions you’re making.  Your confidence will grow not only throughout your education, but the longer you’re on the job.  And as such, your ability to remain calm will also improve.  As a nurse, you can’t panic when something unexpected happens, and you can’t freeze up because you aren’t sure what to do.  When you’re first learning your job and there’s an emergency situation, a more experienced nurses may push you out of the way and take over.  Do not take this personally or be upset.  Use this moment to observe exactly what’s going on, what the nurse is doing and how, and the specific details that are driving the nurse’s decisions.  Watching a more experienced nurse, especially in a crisis, can be one of your most useful learning experiences. Find out if there are trainings offered to help you work through specific scenarios such as sudden cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, or stroke. By attending these trainings, you can practice going through these steps in a less intense environment so that in the real situation, you will be able to work through it easier. As a nurse no two days will ever be the same.  While you may have some routine, it is likely that that routine will also change every now and again.  No two patients are going to behave the same, even when they’re getting the exact same treatment.  Nurses need to be adaptable and flexible.  Nurses need to understand that their work environment and job requirements will change on a daily basis.  Being flexible and adaptable, and just going with the flow, will not only help your day go smoother, it will help reduce the amount of stress you feel. Nurses, just like many professions, are constantly learning.  Whether they learn through a formal classroom environment, or simply by observing, doesn’t matter.  What matters is that you are constantly improving your knowledge and skills, and recognizing specific areas where you might need improvement.  It also means receiving feedback from your peers and supervisors critically, and working with your supervisor and others to correct any deficiencies you have with your skills.",
      "Nursing is a lot like a game of chess.  It’s complex and you have to think several moves ahead.  You need to be able to assess a patient critically to determine his medical needs, while taking multiple factors and potential outcomes into account. Critical thinking is a process by which you review the situation, analyze what’s going on, and question what you don’t know.  You can break the process down into 5 steps: Step 1: Identify the goal, the problem, or the issue. Step 2: Review and diagnose the goal, problem, or issue.  What information do you have available about the goal, problem, or issue?  Based on the information you have, what’s the best resolution? Step 3: Explore your options.  Think about what the resolutions may be, and how and who would actually achieve them. Step 4: Actually carry out the resolution.  Get it done. Step 5: Reflect on your success or failure.  What went well and what didn’t go so well?  What can you do better or differently next time?  How do we learn from this experience? Nurses need to be able to communicate with their patients in order to understand how their patients are feeling and what they are concerned about.  Communicating effectively means you can listen well when someone else is speaking to you, and that you can speak clearly and concisely to someone else (e.g. patient, doctor, other nurses, family members, etc.).  As a nurse you’re also likely to make a lot of notes whether in a physical chart or on the computer, therefore you must also be able to communicate effectively in writing as you may not be there in person to explain what you meant.  Keep in mind that you will be dealing with many different nationalities, including people who may not speak the same language as you or the doctor. Find out what services are available to the patient to help them communicate effectively — are there interpreters on staff? Are you aware of any cultural beliefs or practices that might interfere with their health? As a good nurse you need to be able to listen to a doctor’s instructions and carry out those instructions quickly without needing to clarify every detail.  In order to do this you need to be able to listen to the doctor in what is likely a fast-paced and hectic environment while you’re doing something else. At the same time, don't hesitate to ask questions to clarify what is needed. Doctors, just as nurses, need to communicate effectively. If it is not clear what the physician/provider is trying to relay, keep asking questions. An exceptional nurse not only listens and carries out instruction, they advocate for their patients.  Because of your excellent listening skills, you’ve developed an understanding of your patients, how they feel, and what they want.  You should also understand that your patients may be a little intimidated speaking up and asking their doctor specific questions, or making requests.  As their nurse, you may need to do the speaking up for your patients. Encourage your patient to write down questions that they want answered and that you know them as well to help facilitate questions. If the patient can not ask them, then ask the questions for your patient. To learn more about being an effective communicator, you can read the following wikiHow article, How to Communicate Effectively. Being detail-oriented means you pay attention to both the big stuff and the small stuff.  When dealing with a patient, even the smallest anomaly or symptom can be a big deal, so you need to always be paying attention.  Being detail-oriented means you ensure all your patients get the exact treatment they need, when they need it.  While not exactly the same, being detail-oriented has a lot to do with being organized.  It’s easier to pay attention to the details when you are organized. Detail-oriented also means being accurate.  In the medical field you can’t estimate or guess at the amount of medication you give a patient, you need to be accurate.  Your patient’s life may depend on it.  Being detail-oriented also means paying attention.  Getting distracted or allowing your mind to wander will likely result in you missing something important.  Because all details regarding your patient’s care are critical, you need to remain focused and on task at all times. Nurses, especially those working in a hospital, need to deal with multiple patients at the same time.  Each patient has their own personal requirements that are critical to their well-being.  Each patient also has his or her own personality and emotional needs.  As a nurse you need to be able to organize yourself to keep track of who each of your patients are, what their treatments are, when they need their treatments, and the small details about the patient that will help them feel better (both physically and emotionally). Being able to organize yourself efficiently means being able to do the following things when needed:  Learning to say no.  While you may not be able to say no very often at work, you can certainly say no in your personal life.  Sometimes being able to clear out all the stuff you don’t really want to be doing will lower your stress level overall and help you become more focused when you’re at work. Finding balance in your life. There is such a thing called caregiver burn out. Always ask yourself before accepting an extra shift: what the benefit it and what is the cost? If the cost is personal loss of perceived health, sleep, enjoyment, then the extra money is not worth it. Asking for help.  If you are new to the nursing field, you are going to need to ask for help.  Don’t be afraid to ask, just ask.  Once you’ve asked chances are you’re going to be able to move forward with what you need to do, and understand how to efficiently carry out that task the next time. Prioritizing.  Being organized means being able to prioritize all the tasks you have on your to do list.  Knowing which ones are more important or which ones have the earliest due dates. Spending your time wisely.  Think about all the things you need to do in the next little while, and carry those tasks out efficiently.  If you need to go to the storeroom for one thing, think about all the things you need in there over the next little while so you only have to make one trip.  Don’t waste your time doing repetitive and unnecessary tasks. Most nurses will be on their feet for their entire shift, which can last 12 hours or more.  Nurses may also need to restrain patients, help patients walk from one place to another, hold patients up, move patients to and from a bed or gurney, and other physically demanding tasks.  If you aren’t up to the physical requirements of the job, you will likely be in a lot of pain at the end of a shift.  Personal health must be observed first — how can you advise health-related behavior if you do not observe it yourself? Physical stamina isn’t just about being able to do physical activities, it’s about being able to do them over a long period of time, over and over again. As a nurse you’re allowed to wear scrubs and comfortable shoes — take advantage of this.  There is nothing worse than being on your feet for 12 hours in shoes that are really painful. The medical profession in general isn’t the type of profession where you can always just sit back and \"wait and see.\" In many cases, as a nurse, you’ll notice something and need to react to it quickly.  You won’t always get the chance to pause and evaluate all the options and debate back and forth with another nurse as to the best course of action — sometimes you just need to act.  Being able to think and react quickly comes with experience and confidence.  The more experience and confidence you gain, the faster your ability to react will become. Thinking and reacting quickly can also include knowing when it’s time to get help from someone else ASAP.  Don’t worry if you may be overreacting or if someone will have a bad opinion of you because you bothered them, those things aren’t important.  Keep in mind that your patient’s well-being is always the most important thing and react quickly when that well-being is in jeopardy. Reacting quickly doesn’t mean forgoing critical thinking; it means going through the critical thinking process quickly and carrying out your decision immediately."

      "If your cat is overweight, you'll need to change how you feed him. Changing a cat's feeding schedule can make a huge difference in regards to his weight.  Always make transitions gradual. If you suddenly swap out a cat's old food for a new diet brand, he may act out or refuse to eat. Keep your cat on his regular food but offer him a little bit of the new food you're trying each day.  Cats will work for food. You can use a foraging device, which is a puzzle-like device a cat must dismantle to get food trapped inside. This encourages exercise which is also important to help a cat lose weight.  In nature, cats are pure carnivores. A lot of dry foods are primarily wheat-based and can lead to weight gain if used as a primary food source. Talk to your vet about switching your cat over to canned food. Many cats do not get enough exercise. If your cat is an indoor cat, it's especially important he gets moving each day. Buy your cat a variety of toys and take 20 to 30 minutes each night to play with him. Consider getting electronic, interactive toys a cat can use while you're away at work. Treats are also a major culprit when it come to cat weight gain. Try swapping out normal treats for low-calorie diet treats. Your cat won't have to give up a luxury and will still be able to lose some weight. Keep an eye on your cat's weight to make sure he's losing weight as needed. You can weigh your cat at home, using your own scale. This may not be as accurate as a vet's scale, however. Some veterinary clinics allow you to do free weigh-ins if your cat needs to lose weight. Ask your vet is you can periodically bring your cat in to check his weight.",
      "If you're concerned after doing a body check, you should take your cat to see a veterinarian. You can weigh your cat yourself at home but it's better to take him to the vet. The scales at a vet's office are specifically designed for use on animals. A vet will also be able to determine if your cat is medically obese considering his body type. While a body check can give you insight as to whether you should be concerned, professional veterinary evaluation is important when diagnosing your cat as overweight or obese. When you're at the vet's office, your vet will ask you a variety of questions regarding your cat. This helps determine whether your cat's weight is due to environmental or medical factors.  Obesity in cats can be the result of environmental factors. Your vet will want to know how often you feed your cat as overfeeding can lead to weight gain. If your cat hides a lot due to fear of children or other pets, he may not be getting enough exercise. Your cat also may be bored and not have enough toys or entertainment. You might have to adjust your home environment to help your cat lose weight.  However, environment is not always the cause. Some medications, diseases, and medical conditions can cause your cat to gain weight. If your cat has any other troublesome symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea, let your vet know. He or she may want to conduct certain tests or lab work on your cat to rule out an underlying medical problem. If your cat's weight gain is environmental, talk to your vet about how you feed your cat. He or she can suggest changes you can make to get your cat to a healthier weight. It's important you talk over major changes to your cat's diet with your vet beforehand.",
      "You can start determining if your cat's overweight by looking at him. Examining your cat from above and from the side should help you determine if his weight is a problem.  Look at your cat from above. The area between his ribs and hips should move inward slightly, creating a clearly defined waist. If there is no waist or if his waist is wider than either his hips or ribs, your cat may be overweight.  You should also look at your cat from the side. Cats who are at a healthy weight have what is called an abdominal tuck. This means the area just behind their ribs should have a smaller diameter than the chest. If you do not see an abdominal tuck, your cat may be overweight. You can further examine your cat by touching him. Run your hand over your cat's sides. You should be able to easily feel his ribs. If you cannot feel his ribs, or have to push down to do so, your cat may be overweight. You should also be able to feel bones near the base of your cat's tail. While there should be a small layer of fat protecting this area, you should be able to feel the outlines of his bones without much effort. If you cannot easily feel bones here, your cat may be overweight. A cat's spine, hips, and shoulders should also be fairly bony. While very visible and pointy bones may indicate your cat is underweight, in a healthy cat you should be able to easily detect hip bones, spine bones, and shoulder bones through gentle petting. If you're unable to feel these bones due to layers of fat, your cat is overweight. Many cats have a saggy bit of flesh that hangs down between their back legs. If your cat is otherwise bony, this small pouch of skin is unlikely to be an indication of a weight problem. This skin flap is referred to as the \"primordial pouch\" and its purpose is to protect the stomach during fights with other cats. Cats often kick with their back legs when angry, and this flap of skin protects your cat from such attacks. Many cats will develop a primordial pouch at some point in their lives and it is not necessarily an indicator of feline obesity. However, excess fat may be stored in your cat's primordial pouch if he is overweight. If he shows other symptoms of obesity, check his pouch. It should hang loose and be mostly comprised of skin. If the pouch seems to be filling out with fat, this can be an indicator of obesity."

      "Continue eating in a normal manner. You can use this journal as a baseline for changing your diet.  A food journal can let you see into your diet and give you clues about things you can change to lose weight. Take note of portion sizes, snacking, liquid calories or higher fat foods you typically eat. Star these items or make a list to help you get started with your diet plan. Continue to keep your food journal when you're trying to lose weight. Studies show that those who stick to their food journals are more successful with weight loss long-term. By reducing the amount you are eating, you can signal to your body to start using its stored fat for energy (including the fat stored in your hips).  To lose weight and reduce excess body fat in your entire body and in your hips, you'll need to cut calories. Reduced caloric intake over time will result in weight loss. Creating a deficit of 500 calories daily generally results in about a 1 pound (0.45 kg) weight loss each week. Health professionals consider this safe and healthy weight loss. Use your food journal to help you see what types of foods you can cut to result in a 500 calorie deficit. Following appropriate portion sizes in each of your meals will help you manage your calories and lose weight.  To help you measure portion sizes appropriately, consider buying a food scale or measuring cups. It's ideal to measure each meal and snack to make sure you're staying on track. Eyeballing portions can lead to over estimating portion sizes and underestimating your total caloric intake. Measure foods to the following sizes: 3 to 4 oz (80 to 120 grams) of protein foods (or about the size of a deck of cards), 1 oz of grains or about 1/2 cup (125 ml), 1 cup (250 ml) vegetables or 2 cups (500 ml) of leafy greens and 1/2 cup (125 ml) of chopped fruit or 1 small piece.  Include 1 serving of protein and 2 servings of a fruit or vegetable at each meal. It's recommended to consume about 2 to 3 servings of grains throughout the day. Another item to focus on to help you lose weight in addition to watching calories and portion sizes is choosing lower calorie foods.  Foods that are portion controlled and lower in calorie are the best choice when it comes to weight loss.  Choose low-calorie and lean protein foods like: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy products, pork, seafood, legumes and tofu. Choose 100% whole grains without seasonings or sauces. Whole grains are more nutritious as they have higher amounts of fiber and other nutrients. Purchase grains that do not contain a seasoning packet or a sauce to minimize calories. Most fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories. Be careful if you're purchasing canned or frozen items. Make sure they do not contain added seasonings, sauces or added sugars. Many times liquid calories are responsible for a large part of the excess calories in your diet. In addition, cutting these out completely can really help you lose weight.  Liquid calories are found in a variety of beverages. Limiting or completely avoiding these types of drinks is the best idea to help support your weight loss. Limit drinks like: regular soda, full fat milk, juices and juice cocktails, alcohol, sweet tea, sweetened coffee drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks and hot chocolate. Although some drinks contain no calories, they should be limited due to the high amounts of artificial sweeteners and other additives. Limit things like: diet sodas, diet energy drinks and diet sports drinks. Fill up on clear, hydrating fluids like: water, flavored water, unsweetened decaf coffee and decaf unsweetened tea. Aim for a minimum of eight 8 ounce glasses daily, but you may even need up to 13 glasses daily. Another dangerous area for weight loss is snacking. Too many snacks or grazing constantly throughout the day can sabotage your weight loss. Also, many snack foods are made out of processed carbs and sugars that are unhealthy and can lead to fat buildup.  Health professionals typically recommend that you limit the amount of calories you eat from snacks throughout the day. If your end goal is weight loss, keep snacks to about 150 calories per snack.  Depending on your lifestyle and activity level, you typically will only need 1 to 2 snacks maximum daily.  Eat snacks that combine a low-fat source of protein with a natural high fiber source, such as a fruit or vegetable. Some good snacks to eat include 1 oz of mixed nuts (30 grams) with a medium sized apple, 1 individual low-fat greek yogurt with 1/2 cup (125 ml) of grapes, 1/2 cup (125 ml) of cottage cheese with 1 cup (250 ml) of cherry tomatoes, or 3 oz (80 grams) of turkey jerky with 1 cup (250 ml) of carrot sticks.",
      "High intensity exercises or HIIT is an exercise that combined both moderate and high intensity cardio activities that can torch calories and help burn body fat.  Fitness professionals have been prompting HIIT workouts to help those who want to get rid of excess body fat. Although it does not specifically target your hips, it can help reduce your overall body fat. HIIT workouts are typically shorter in length and combine short bouts of both very high intensity activities and more moderate intensity activities. They are great in combination with other cardio and strength training. You cannot reduce hip fat without reducing overall body fat. You also cannot spot correct using only toning exercises or strength training.  Including regular cardio is an important component to help you meet your end goal.  Health professionals recommend doing 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercises each week. This can include walking/jogging, cycling, swimming or dancing. If you want to experience a quicker reduction in your hips, aim to workout for 1 hour 5 to 6 days per week or up to 300 minutes weekly.  Include cardio exercises that are known to slim and tone your thighs. Activities like running/jogging, using the stair master or cycling are great to help burn calories and tone your legs. This popular exercise works your hips, butt, thighs and stomach and will help to build lean muscle. Developing muscles in those areas, combined with overall fat loss, can help with toning (showing lean muscle definition).  Start with your feet hip width apart. Place your hands in prayer position in the middle of your chest. While putting your weight into your heels sit down like you are trying to sit in a chair. Push your buttocks out behind you and go down as far as you can or until your thighs are almost parallel to the floor. Pause when your thighs are parallel to the ground. Slowly rise back up to your starting position. Repeat 10 to 20 times or as necessary. In this exercise, you will step forward with 1 foot and allow your knees to bend.  This is a great exercise to help develop muscles around your hips and entire thigh.  Start standing with feet shoulder width apart and put your hands on your hips. Step forward a few feet (0.5 m) with 1 foot. Keep your toes point forward. Drop your back knee and bend your front knee at the same time in a slow and controlled movement. Drop down until your front thigh is almost parallel to the ground. Ensure that your front knee is aligned with your ankle (not in front of your ankle). Using your front thigh to push your body back up to the starting position. Switch legs and repeat as necessary. This particular exercise helps specifically target the muscles in your hips and thighs. It's a great move to help tone your outer thigh up to your hip.  Lay on the ground and rest on your side with legs stacked on top of each other. Rest your head on the arm closest to the floor. Place your upper arm on your hip. Keeping your leg straight and foot flexed, raise your top leg up towards the ceiling. Lower back down to the starting position slowly. Switch sides and do the same number of raises with your other leg. The bridge is a position that's known for working the back of your legs but can help your thighs and hips look more toned.  Lay on the ground and face the ceiling. Bend your knees in front of your body at a 90 degree angle. Rest your arms by your sides. Pressing through your buttocks, raise your hips into the air until your body is in a straight line declining from knees to head. Hold for a few seconds before slowly rolling your spine back onto the ground to the starting position. Repeat 10 to 20 times or as necessary. Make it harder by raising 1 leg and holding your hips at an even level during the minute. Repeat with the opposite leg. A typical ballet move, this squat like exercise helps tone your thighs, butt and hips.  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Point your toes in a 45 degree angle away from your body. Put your hands in prayer position in front of your chest or put your hands on your hips. Lower your body down keeping your head, torso and buttocks in a straight linear line from ceiling to floor. As you lower your body down, your knees should be bending out away from your body.  Lower yourself as far as you can comfortably go. Slowly raise your body back up to the starting position, using your inner thighs and buttocks to push yourself back up. Repeat as many times as necessary."

      "Many beginning coders struggle with what language to pick when they first start learning. (Because they don't know where to start with their first code).  The actual language that you start learning on doesn't make a big difference when it comes to learning about data structures and logic. These are the skills that matter most, and they can be honed with any language.  When picking a language, just focus on what kind of development you want to start with and pick an introductory language from there. For example, if you want to learn web development, start with HTML5, supplemented with CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. If you want to want to do desktop applications, start with C++ or another basic programming language. If you make coding a career, you will find that you may never use the language that you first learned to code. Instead, you will be learning languages as you go through documentation and experimentation. The internet is a treasure trove of free tutorials, classes, and videos, all tailored towards the language of your choice. You can start getting a basic grasp of just about any introductory language in a day.  Popular sites include Bento, CodeAcademy, Code.org, html.net, Khan Academy, Udacity, W3Schools, Code School and many more. There are a variety of language-specific starter guides available right here on wikiHow. You can find how-to guides for almost any programming scenario on YouTube. Stack Exchange is one of the more popular Q&A sites for any programming questions you may have. Many programming languages allow you to use external text editors when you write your code. Find a text editor that will allow you to see indentations and code markup. Popular programs include Notepad++ (Windows), TextWrangler (OS X), JEdit, or Visual Studio Code. Some programming languages require a compiler in order to run the code that you create. Compilers translate the code you write into a lower-level language that the machine can process. Many compilers are open-source and free to use. Languages that require compilers include:  C C++ C# Java BASIC Fortran Pick a good introductory project that will help you get your feet wet. There are a variety of suggestions and tutorials online, but some places to start are basic websites for HTML, basic database and form functions with PHP, or simple programs with any of the compiler languages. All programming languages have a comment feature that allows you to enter text that is ignored by the compiler. This allows you to add comments to your code. These comments are crucial, both for letting others know how your code works and for reminding yourself what your code does. You can also use the comment function to quickly remove code from your program for testing purposes. Put comment tags around the code you want to exclude and then remove the comment tags to return the code. When you're learning as you go, don't be ashamed to look things up and see how others have tackled the same tasks. Take time to understand why the code is doing what it does. See this guide for details on how to view the source code of websites.",
      "Community colleges, tech schools and online programs offer certifications and classes that will help you get a job as well as teaching you programming. An advanced degree like Computer Science is not always necessary, but could help to get a full time programming job.  (A lot can be said for having one-on-one time with a teacher or programming expert, something that isn't always available with online sources.) Classes can get expensive, so weigh the benefits. If programming is just a hobby, classes may not be worth the time and money. If you want to turn programming into a career, classes can give you a big boost (but again, it's far from necessary if you have the talent). Beyond simply learning programming languages, you will benefit a lot from logic and mathematics classes, as these are often required for advanced programming. You don't necessarily need to learn this at school, but classroom settings can help.  Programming involving physics calculations and other simulations requires a strong understanding of algorithms and models. Logic is the fundamental basis of programming, so understanding logic and processes will help you problem-solve when you are coding. Knowing advanced math isn't required for most programming, but the knowledge can lead to benefits and optimizations. Once you've got a good grasp on your initial language, you can start to branch out. Find another language that complements the one you know, or pick a language for a specific job that interests you. Complementary languages, such as HTML and CSS, are often the easiest to learn.   Java is one of the most popular languages, and there are often lots of opportunities for Java developers. Java can run on a huge variety of systems and has innumerable applications. Java is used for Android applications, one of the fastest growing markets. C++ is highly recommended for developing video games. Learning how to code in Unity (a widely used, low-cost game engine) and UDK (the code for the popular Unreal engine) can help open some doors, though they aren't as useful outside of the video game industry. If you want to make iPhone apps, Xcode and Objective-C are going to be your primary tools. You'll also need a Mac, since Xcode can only compile on a Mac.  Python is a server scripting language that is one of the easier languages to learn. Python is used for web services such as Pinterest and Instagram, and is simple enough to learn the basics in just a few days. You will often be faced with challenges while programming, especially when it comes to hunting for bugs or implementing a new idea. You'll have to learn to be satisfied with achieving small results rather than solving a whole puzzle at once. Patience leads to more effective code, which will lead to better-performing programs and happier colleagues. .  If you have multiple people working on a project, you get multiple viewpoints on how to go about it. Working on teams is virtually unavoidable in the business world, so unless you're planning to develop everything independently, be prepared to work with others. Work as a volunteer designing websites or writing desktop applications. A part time job with a small company can lead to opportunities to write code for websites or simple applications. There are countless communities and gatherings of developers that can help support and inspire you. Look up local programming conventions, participate in a hack-a-thon or game jam (timed events with a common theme), and sign up on some programming forums to start expanding your exposure and network. It is estimated that it takes about 15,000 hours before you can be considered an expert in computer programming. This is years of applied practice. True mastery of programming will come only after you put the time in to practice and become proficient. Try to spend time programming every day, even when you're not working. Programming in your free time can lead to breakthroughs and new ideas."

      "Once you've gotten past knee-deep into the water, get on the board in the correct position and start paddling out, toward the waves. Use the paddling motion with your hands and kick with both your feet just below the water's surface for the strongest propulsion. The nose of the board should be about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) above water. If you're just starting out, you should avoid any waves that are too high and fast, or generally out of your comfort zone. Pick waves that are headed straight toward the beach and that won't make you travel too high or too fast. Once you've found your wave, you should turn toward the beach and start kicking toward it, waiting to be brought forward by the current of the wave. The wave should be steep enough to move you forward, but it has to not have broken yet. To improve your chances of finding a good wave, look out for the place where most of the waves are breaking. You should wait for the waves about 5-10 feet beyond that location. You should feel yourself traveling faster as the wave approaches you. If you want some extra speed, you can push down the nose of your board slightly to move even faster. If the wave is moving too fast for your comfort, then you can do the opposite, pushing the nose up an inch or two to get some friction and slow yourself down. Continue to kick your feet as you travel down the face of the wave. You can also lean slightly into the wave to improve your speed. You can also choose to go right or left here. To go left, lean your hips toward the left side of the board and place your left elbow on the upper left side deck of the board, while holding onto the upper right edge of your board with your free hand. To go right, do the opposite.",
      "If you want to be able to body board, then you should already be a good swimmer. You'll need to use a lot of the techniques you use for swimming to propel your board, and furthermore, you'll need to be a good swimmer to swim without your board if you wipe out. Additionally, you should only try bodyboarding if you know that the sea conditions are safe and that there's a lifeguard on duty. You should try bodyboarding with a friend or an instructor instead of by yourself. Once you get more comfortable with it, you can go at it alone. You'll need to attach the leash to your upper arm. This will prevent you from losing the board when you wipe out. Attach the strap to your upper arm tightly, but loosely enough so that your arm is still comfortable. The leash will keep your arm and the board secured together. If you're swimming in colder water, you'll need a wet suit to keep your body warm. A rash guard will also do, keeping your body from getting irritated while you're bodyboarding, and protecting you from the sun. They are made of Lycra and can also be worn under your wetsuit to keep chafing or rubbing to a minimum. Get some fins with tethers and attach the tethers firmly to your ankles. You'll need fins to help you kick with higher speed, making it easier for you to catch a wave. You should also consider getting a pair of fin socks to wear under your fins, to add an extra layer of warmth and comfort for your feet. Before you try to catch a wave, you should have a strong sense of how you should be positioned on the board. Get in the sand and lie on the board with your hands at the top (nose) of the board, and the back (tail) of the board under your lower belly. Keep your weight centered on the board. Once you're in this position, you can practice paddling. Paddle your hands at the side of the board, like you're scooping water towards you, or as if you're doing the free stroke in swimming. Kick your feet under the water for the best propulsion and faster movement while bodyboarding. Walk into the water with your board until it's about knee deep. Lift your feet high with every step to avoid getting stuck. You should start looking for white water waves that go straight into the beach.",
      "Understanding the different parts of a wave will help you develop skills and learn tricks, because you'll know what to look out for. Here are the parts of a wave that you should know:   The lip. The breaking part of a wave that moves from top to bottom. The steepness of the wave determines the shape of the lip.  Whitewater. This is the part of the wave that has already broken.  The face. The unbroken, walling part of the wave.  The shoulder. The part of the wave that is just outside the breaking section of the wave's face.  Flats. The flat water you see in front of the breaking wave.  Tube. The hollow hole between the throwing lip and the wall of the wave. You'll need to know what the different parts of the board are so you can follow along and learn a number of skills and tricks. Here's what you'll need to know:   The deck. The part of the board where you lie down.  Slick bottom. The bottom of the board that has a smooth or slick surface.  The nose. The front of the board that you hold.  The nose bulbs. These are the small bumps on each corner of the board that you will hold with your hands.  The bumpers. The extra foam layer that runs through the nose and tail, helping to keep the slick bottom from peeling.  The rail. The side of the bodyboard.  The tail. The back end of the board.  The channels. The areas on the bottom of the board that reduce drag and speed you up.  The stringer. The rod that keeps the board stiff.  The template. The shape of the board.  The rocker. The level of flatness of the bodyboard. Stalling is an important skill for any bodyboarder to have. You can use stalling to brake in a number situations, such as when you need to slow down the tubing section of a wave. Here are the two ways to do it:  Drag your legs in the water to slow you down, or move your hips more to the inside rail of the board. Pull up on the nose of the board while applying downward pressure on the tail with your hips. Hold the board at a downward angle of about 30-45° until you reach the speed you want. When you finish stalling, slide up on the board to pick up speed and then set your rail and continue moving forward."

      "Find the departure and arrival times for a trip to the Salisbury station, which is the station closest to Stonehenge. If you begin in London like most travelers, you will depart from the Waterloo train station. Trains run approximately every hour. Ticket prices will depend on the season and how early you purchase your ticket. Buying in advance usually costs less than waiting until the day of. Child discounts are available, and elderly discounts may be available depending on your ticket preferences. The train ride should take less than 1.5 hours. Once you get to Salisbury, you’ll be 9.5 miles (15 kilometers) from Stonehenge. You will need to use a bus or hire a cab to travel the remaining distance to the Stonehenge Visitor Centre. There is a local bus called the Stonehenge Tour Bus that runs every half-hour during the season and every hour during off-season. The bus runs from 10 AM until Stonehenge closes, and riders can hop on and off at their convenience. Your bus trip will take about half an hour.  On-season spans the months of April through September, and off-season runs from October through March.  During on-season, Stonehenge closes at 7:00 PM (19:00), and during off-season it closes at 5:00 PM (17:00). The last entry is two hours before they close.",
      "If you are a visitor or rely on public transportation for your mobility needs, then you will need to gain access to a car. Renting a car is a reliable option if you can’t borrow one.  If you fly into England, it’s easiest to rent your car from the airport.  If you are traveling from out of the country, you can use your driver’s license from your home country to rent the car, though you usually have to pay an extra insurance. Visit the Wiltshire Council website at http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/ before driving to Stonehenge to check for road closures. This is especially important during the warmer weather. Your trip should take about 2 hours from London by car, but it can take longer during the summer months when the roads are busy. Depending on where you begin your journey, you will need to get directions from your starting point to Stonehenge. Because you are driving yourself, you can take your vehicle all the way to the site. Free parking is available if you have purchased a ticket to Stonehenge. The parking lot is located near Airman’s Corner, which is the intersection of A360 and B3086 above the A303. A free shuttle bus will drive you from the parking lot to Stonehenge. The ride takes about 10 minutes and stops midway at Fargo Plantation.",
      "Both of these locations are at the center of London, which is where the public bus to Stonehenge originates. If you are starting from a different bus station or airport around London, you will need to first travel to one of these two sites. If you are not in London, check the bus schedule to look for a route to Amesbury, which is the destination for Stonehenge. If you are unable to travel to Amesbury, then you will need to connect through London. Bus tickets are available on the bus, at the station, or from a ticket agent for the National Express. Taking the bus is the most economical option. The closest bus stop to Stonehenge is in Amesbury, which is just 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Stonehenge. The ride from London takes about 2 hours, so plan accordingly so that you’ll have time to enjoy the site and get to your night-time accommodations.

      "Leather stretches out naturally when it’s being used, so by simply wearing your leather pants, jacket, or skirt around the house, it will begin to stretch. Shoes can also be stretched out by walking around in them, though it may lead to some blisters.  This isn’t a quick method for stretching leather — stretching it naturally by wearing your leather around is going to take days or weeks, depending on your end goal. Wear your leather for 2 or more hours a day, and be sure to move around while you're wearing it. The more you wear your leather, the faster it will stretch. If you have a wallet, coin purse, bag, or other accessory that needs stretching, try stuffing it. Use a material such as paper or cloth, making sure the material won’t damage the leather by being too rough. Fill your leather accessory with the material so that it’s as full as you would like. How long you let the item stretch will depend on its size and your personal preference.  This method will work even better if you get the material slightly wet before stuffing the leather. Apply a leather stretching spray before stuffing the leather for it to stretch out even faster. These sprays can be found at a shoe or big-box store, as well as online. Stretch out pieces of leather by first attaching one end of the leather to a stable source. This could be a table, chair, shelf — anything that you can clamp the leather onto. Weigh down the opposing end of the leather using a rock, can, or other heavy source. Weighing down one end of the leather will help it stretch out faster. You can stretch a leather jacket or pants by weighing down the arms or legs of the article of clothing. Attach the clothing to a strong hanger at the top.",
      "Heat helps leather stretch by opening up the pores and making it soft. Turn on a hairdryer and aim it at the leather you’d like to stretch, heating the leather evenly. Wait until the leather is warm and soft before turning the hairdryer off. If you’re trying to stretch out your shoes, put on thick socks before using a hairdryer. Once your socks and shoes are on, use the hairdryer to heat up your shoes. Move your feet around in the shoes to stretch them out effectively. Make sure to wear your shoes as they cool off to ensure that they hold the stretch. Use a hairdryer to heat up an article of clothing you’d like to stretch. This can be a leather shirt, jacket, pants, or belt. Once it’s warm and soft, put on the article of clothing. Move around in it to stretch the leather out, and keep the article of clothing on until the leather is cool.",
      "Buy a leather stretching spray that you can spray directly onto the leather to stretch it. The spray should cause the leather to become stretchy and soft. These sprays are often used on shoes and clothing items, so it’s important to wear the leather item after you’ve sprayed it to ensure it stretches properly.  If you’re applying the leather stretching spray to something other than clothing or shoes, you’ll need to hang the leather and weigh down an end with something heavy to stretch it out. Leather stretching sprays can be found at most big-box and shoe stores, or you can buy them online. The sprays typically cost $5-$15. There are leather conditioners that you can buy that will help soften your leather. They typically come in a liquid or cloth form, ranging in cost from $5-$20.  These conditioners are great if you’re trying to make furniture, car interiors, or other accessories more pliable, but they also work well on leather clothing and shoes. Most conditioners will require you to apply the conditioner to the leather using a cloth. You’ll wait roughly 2 hours for the leather to absorb the conditioner before wiping away any excess residue. Shoe stretchers are usually wooden or plastic inserts that you put in your shoe to stretch it out. You can buy shoe stretchers that will target specific areas of the shoe that you wish to be stretched. Shoe stretchers cost an average of $20. You can also take your shoes to a professional to have them stretched. Professionals will have better quality and more complex stretching machines, allowing them to stretch out your shoes in a much faster amount of time.",
      "If your piece of leather will fit in the sink, great! Fill it up with enough water to submerge the leather. You can also use a container or tub, filling your chosen container up with water. Just make sure your leather will fit in the container without the water overflowing. You can use warm water or room temperature water. Once you’ve filled up a container or sink, place your leather in the water. You want the leather to be fully submerged in the water, so you may have to twist it around a little for the water to soak into the leather. Make sure your leather is entirely saturated with water. A good way to check for this is to wait until there are no more bubbles coming from the leather. Once you think it’s saturated with water, let the leather continue to soak for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes are up, put on the wet leather. While this may not be the most comfortable way to wear your leather, it’s important for you to move around with it on to stretch it out. Wear the leather for an hour or two, continuing to bend the parts of the leather you wish to be stretched. This works best when you’re dealing with leather clothing, shoes, or accessories, such as a belt. If you're wary of submerging your leather in a tub of water, you can use rubbing alcohol and water instead. This will simply be sprayed onto specific parts of your leather as opposed to saturating it entirely. Combine the rubbing alcohol and water into a bowl, stirring it around. Once the solution is mixed, pour it into an empty spray bottle. If you don’t have a spray bottle, you can also use a paper towel or cloth. Dip the paper towel into the mixture, making sure that it’s damp but not soaking wet. Spray the solution onto the parts of the leather that you want to stretch out. If you’re spraying an article of clothing, aim for the areas that will be bending when you wear them. You don’t need to completely saturate the leather, but it should be wet. If you’re using a paper towel, dab the leather with the damp paper towel to transfer the mixture onto the leather. Right after you’ve applied the mixture to the leather, put it on. Bend and stretch the parts that have the mixture on them. Wear the leather until the spots where you applied the alcohol are completely dry.  Wear thick socks if you’re spraying the alcohol mixture onto your shoes before putting the leather shoes on to stretch them out. If you've applied the alcohol to something other than a wearable item, bend and stretch the item using your hands.",
      "Line both of your shoes with a plastic bag, making sure that the bag is big enough to fill the entire shoe. Use a plastic shopping bag as opposed to a large Ziploc bag if you have larger shoes. Make sure the plastic doesn’t have holes in it and is strong enough to hold water. Pour water into the plastic shoe lining you’ve created, filling it up to the top of the shoes. Make sure you seal the bag once you’re finished so that water doesn’t leak out. Check to see that water has reached the entire shoe, especially down near the toes. Once the plastic bags are sealed, place your shoes in the freezer. Make sure they are sitting flat as opposed to on their side so that the water freezes correctly. Leave your shoes in the freezer overnight to ensure that the water freezes entirely. Take your shoes out of the freezer after the water has completely turned to ice. The ice should have helped stretch out the leather, so now you can wait for the ice to melt. Once the ice has turned back to water, remove the water and plastic bags from your shoes. While you don’t have to wait for all of the ice to melt completely, let most of it melt before removing the plastic bag from your shoe to prevent your shoe from getting damaged."

      "Wrap the cake tightly with plastic wrap. Ensure the sides, edges, and base are covered neatly and snug with plastic wrap for quality storing. Cakes made with butter will most likely last less than oil-based cakes. Keep the cake on a counter at room temperature. It should last for about week. Plastic wrap is not needed to store a frosted cake as the frosting is almost as a shield for the cake; it protects it from any air that floats like dust, pet hair, fuzz, and bacteria. Also, plastic wrap would mess up the frosting and mix together with the other frosting colors. Store your cake in a cake-keeper or flip a large bowl and cover it with that. It can last for about 4-5 days. If your frosting includes heavy cream (whipped cream topping) or a fruit filling like strawberry it must stay in the fridge in order to stay off from bacteria. Sliced cakes are a little difficult to store and can be tricky, however it is possible.  Remember as soon as you slice a cake, all the moisture leaves and it starts to become stale and hard. Try covering the cake with plastic wrap, especially the edges, to prevent that from happening. If you can, try applying frosting over the edges to protect any moisture from leaving. Sliced cake does not last for long, usually about 3-4 days. It doesn't matter if your cake is frosted, not frosted, sliced, and/or not sliced refrigerating is one of the best ways to store a birthday cake. It is recommended to do this during the hot seasons like spring or summer because a lot of heat and moisture can cause bacteria. For a cake that is not frosted, cover it well with plastic wrap. For a cake that is frosted, freeze the cake for about 15 minutes to let the frosting become a bit stiff. Your cake can last for about a week. When rooming your cake from the fridge, have it sit for about 10 minutes with room temperature or else it will be dry and dull. . If you want your cake to last longer than a week, freeze it. A well-covered cake that is stored properly can last for nearly a month. When removing your cake from the freezer, have it thaw using room temperature.",

    "document": [
      "Take a Ziploc bag spacious enough to fit the entire cigar box inside and poke small holes in both sides of the bag to ventilate it. Insert the open cigar box inside the bag and seal it.  A quart-sized bag will probably be sufficient for most smaller cigar boxes; anything bigger will likely require a gallon-sized bag. Don’t make the holes too large, or the cigars may become oversaturated as they sit. A paperclip or the point of a knife should work fine for poking small holes. Wet a sponge and ring out the excess water. Place the sponge at the bottom of a second, larger Ziploc bag. This will provide an artificial source of moisture from which the cigars can be revived.  Make sure to use a new sponge, and, if possible, wet it with bottled or distilled water. Old, used sponges and tap water are filled with bacteria and chemicals that can cause your cigars to mold.  Re-wet the sponge every couple of days when you rotate the cigars. Slide the ventilated bag containing the open cigar box into the second bag containing the sponge. Seal the second bag to lock in the moisture of the sponge, which will slowly diffuse through the ventilated bag and into the dry cigars. Rehydration with this method will probably take a week or longer. Don’t let the cigars become wet. A wet cigar is a separate problem. Take a look at the bags every couple of days to re-wet the sponge and test to see if the cigars are absorbing moisture. Rotate each cigar a quarter turn for even moisture distribution; switch up their positions inside the box if necessary.",
      "Store the cigars somewhere with abundant natural moisture in the atmosphere. Damp or humid places like cellars and greenhouses make ideal environments for exposing dried out cigars to constant, steady levels of humidity. Be sure that the place you choose is room temperature, or only slightly warmer or cooler. Never leave cigars in places that receive direct sunlight or are near any kind of heat source. Crack open or remove the lid of the cigar box and make sure the cigars are evenly distributed inside. Leaving the top of the box open will allow moisture to more easily infiltrate the box and penetrate through to the tobacco inside the cigars.  If the cigars aren’t completely dried out, leaving the lid propped open will be sufficient for allowing moisture to enter the box. For thoroughly desiccated cigars, leave the lid off. A warm, damp towel can be folded and placed beneath the stored cigar box to provide an extra boost of moisture for especially dry cigars. Just be careful to change the towel out frequently, or it might mildew. Leave the cigars in the humid location for a couple weeks to a month. Make sure the cigars are situated where they won’t be knocked over, become wet or be exposed to direct heat or cold. This is the simplest method of rehydrating dry cigars, but also the slowest, as rehydration will occur at a very gradual rate.  Though it takes time, slow rehydration works best, as moisture is returned to the cigars little by little, which keeps the cigars from becoming overhydrated.  Overhydration is essentially irreversible, and can result in deadening the cigar’s flavor, making it difficult to keep lit and even causing mold to grow on the tobacco. Check back on the progress of the cigars regularly. Rotate each cigar a quarter turn inside the box every few days; this will ensure that the entire outer edge of each cigar receives the same amount of moisture so that they hydrate evenly.",
      "Store the cigar box on a shelf or inside a cabinet in the bathroom where you take your daily shower. The cigars will become a fixture in your bathroom for a week or two while they undergo the rehydration process. If you prefer, you can store the box of cigars out in the open. Many cigar boxes are of rich, ornate construction and will just look like eye-catching decorative pieces while they’re being salvaged. Every day before showering, take the cigars box out and open the lid. Place the box on the sink or toilet seat somewhere within a few feet of the shower. Once you’re done showering, close the lid of the box and return it to where it’s being stored. The humidity from the shower will be trapped inside the box and begin seeping into the cigars.  Be extremely careful not to let the cigars get wet. It may be best to keep especially hot showers down to 10-20 minutes, as the temperature of the water will produce a higher concentration of steam. Every other day when you bring the cigar box out before your shower, rotate the cigars. As you do, take note of the appearance and feel of the cigars. Shuffle them around in the box every 3-4 days so that any layer or section of the box doesn’t receive more or less moisture than another. As they soak up moisture, most cigars will feel supple and slightly sticky to the touch, and may darken in color somewhat. It’s important not to allow them to remain in the exceptionally humid bathroom environment for long than necessary, as an overhydrated cigar is an equally difficult and time-consuming fix. Inspect the cigars regularly to see how they’re coming along. If storing the cigars near your shower seems to be hydrating them too rapidly, employ an alternate method, like leaving them open in a damp cellar.  You should check on the cigars and their rehydration environment frequently to make sure that storage conditions haven’t changed unexpectedly. Once cigars are rehydrated, they should be moved to humidity-controlled storage or smoked right away."

This will help you plan your next move and make it easier to determine how you want to play the board. For example, if you have a tall mound and you’re debating on whether you need to burn some rows or not, checking for an I piece can save you from unnecessary burning. Part of getting better at Tetris is adjusting to the way that pieces drop at different speeds as the levels progress. As the levels increase, you’ll need to move faster, build smaller mounds, and rotate pieces more accurately. Play on marathon mode when practicing alone to get used to the way levels progress. Games of competitive Tetris usually start at level 5 or 10. If you’re already pretty good with the basics, go ahead and start your marathon runs from these positions. While the scoring systems vary, every version of Tetris awards the highest score for clearing 4 rows of bricks at once. The only way to do this is to build up a mound that is at least 4 rows tall while leaving a single column completely open for the I piece. When you finally get an I piece, place it vertically in the column that you left open to score a “Tetris” and get the most points possible.  Scoring in Tetris refers to the number of rows that you clear at a time. A single is when you clear 1 row, a double is 2 rows, a triple is 3 rows, and a Tetris is 4 rows. You get a huge set of bonus points for scoring a Tetris. In competitive Tetris, the term “Tetris rate” refers to the percentage of your points that come from scoring Tetrises. If your Tetris rate is over 50%, you’re doing really well. If you ever misplace a piece, dig it out by clearing the rows around it. Do this by completing the rows to make them disappear. Score singles, doubles, and triples above and underneath the obscured section to clear the column out instead of trying to score a Tetris on top of it.  As you level up in Tetris, the rate at which the pieces fall increases. This means that it’s more advantageous to lose some points early on by clearing a well out for a Tetris than it is to build Tetrises on top of a mound. Scoring singles, doubles, or triples to clear a well that you accidentally covered is called “digging” or “cleaning.”",
      "The long piece and T-shaped piece always rotate to the right of the screen when you spin them. This means that you need more space on the right side of the screen to move pieces as the game progresses. Start each game by layering pieces on the left side to keep the right side open. Build up rows of pieces and leave the rightmost column open until you have 4 solid rows. Once you have a long piece (called an I piece), drop it in the column and start over again.  In Tetris, a “well” refers to the column that you leave open to score while the other cells on a row are getting filled. Lay I pieces horizontally when you get them early on to build your mound. If you start with a Z or S piece, you’ll need to leave an opening on the bottom row. Place it in the middle so that you can tuck a J or L piece into the open cell. You lose a game of Tetris when the pieces stack all the way to the ceiling of the playing field. If you’ve covered multiple wells on accident or left too many pieces hanging, you’ll need to “burn” a few rows to lower the size of your mound and give yourself more room to work. As soon as you realize that the mound is getting too big for you to safely maneuver pieces around, start clearing rows by completing them however you can to make it smaller.  When you complete a row, it disappears. Making rows disappear will make your mound smaller. “Clearing,” “digging,” and “burning” have different connotations in terms of the player’s intentions, but they’re all just different ways of saying “make rows disappear.” Sometimes, you simply won’t get an I piece for the first 20-30 turns of the game. This will require a lot of burning early on to keep your mound manageable. Adjust the amount of burning you do as you level up. As the pieces move faster with every level, the amount of space that you’ll need to move pieces will increase. RNG stands for “random number generator.” You will hear players complain about RNG when they go a long time without an I piece and have to cover the well. Competitive Tetris gives you bonus points for placing pieces more quickly. Increase the speed that you drop pieces into place by pressing down on your joystick or keyboard and holding it while the piece travels. Instead of pausing to rotate a piece, rotate the piece while it falls.  The points that you accrue over the course of a match will add up quite a bit. Soft drop whenever you comfortably can to increase your score. When you hold a button or stick down while you place a piece, you are performing a “soft drop.” On some versions of Tetris, you can press up on your joystick or keyboard to drop a piece instantly. In timed Tetris, utilize the hard drop to place a piece as fast as you can. As soon as you get a piece, rotate it to match the slot you need. Move it left or right until it is floating over the position that you want to place it and press up. The piece will instantly shoot to the bottom of the screen where you were hovering. The most popular version of competitive Tetris is played on Nintendo's Tetris. There is no hard drop function in this version of the game.",
      "If you play a T, J, L, Z, or S piece in a way where there is an open space underneath it, you’ve created an overhang. Because there is a delay between a piece moving down one cell and setting on a row beneath it, you can rotate or move a piece into these open spaces by pressing the rotation button right before it settles. This is called “tucking,” and it is a necessary move to know if you want to get out of tough situations. When you tuck a piece after performing a hard drop, it is called a zangi-move. The T-spin is a tough move that can get you out of tight spots if you can master it. Because of the delay before a piece settles, you can rotate a T piece into a slot at the last moment to fit it in unexpected ways. To do this, press the rotate button right before a T piece settles and it will spin into a slot that it otherwise wouldn’t have fit into.  For example, if there is a gap created by an overhang on your mound where a T brick could fit from the side, you wouldn’t be able to drop it directly in. You could, however, lower it next to the opening and the rotate it at the last minute to settle the cell that sticks out snuggly into the opening. The T spin cannot accurately be performed if you don’t have the rotations for the T piece memorized. Tucking generally refers to simply sliding a piece, while spinning it refers to rotating it into a slot. The principles behind the 2 moves are the same though—you’re filling in a hidden slot by moving at the last possible second. On classic versions of Tetris, the O block cannot be rotated. In some newer versions, the O block can be rotated right before it lands. This will allow you to squeeze the O block right into a space that is blocked by an overhanging piece. Press the rotation button right before the O block lands to spin it. At levels higher than 15, the game will drop pieces at such a high rate that you’ll have less than 1 second to rotate and place them. To save time, learn to hyper-tap by tapping a button repeatedly instead of holding it down to move a piece left or right. When you get to higher levels, tapping the button will be more efficient than holding it down. Hyper-tapping can cause a lot of strain on your hands and wrists. Take breaks in between practice sessions to preserve your body."

      "Grabbing Your Audience’s Attention Before Your Introduction"
    ],
    "document": [
      "You want the audience to remember who you are, so don’t mumble or rush through saying your name. Speak loudly and confidently, and make sure you enunciate every syllable. If you have an unusual or difficult to pronounce name, you may want to add a small remark to help your audience remember it. For example, you can say “My name is Jacob Misen, like ‘risen’ but with an M” Think about how you will help your audience and briefly communicate that rather than just listing your credentials or job title. Your basic credentials will probably be listed on the presentation program, anyway. Ask yourself what special skills and experience you have that would interest your audience and introduce yourself with those. If you are VP of Marketing at a large company, it can actually be much more effective to say something like “I have more than a decade of experience using Facebook marketing ads to target clients in the dance industry” rather than simply stating your job title. If there are other details about yourself that are interesting and relevant to the presentation, you don’t have to list them all in your introduction. Instead, add them to your handout or powerpoint presentation. Your audience can read them there if they want. You can also specifically refer your audience to the handout or powerpoint for more information. For example, if you want to let them know that you have articles in many international newspapers but you don’t want to list them all out, simply say “I’ve written for a number of internationally recognized news organizations. You can find the full list on the first page of my handout.” You don’t have to give the audience everything about yourself right away. Stick to the most interesting and relevant information. If you have other interesting personal details you want to share, you can add them in other parts of the presentation. For example, you could say “when I designed a website for Richard Branson last year …” to inform your audience that you have an impressive resume, without having to list it all for them in your introduction. Once you’ve got a great introduction, it’s important you seamlessly and effectively transition into the meat of your presentation. Having a planned transition will also help you maintain your confidence because you’ll know exactly where you are going and how to get there. Try concluding your introduction by mentioning a client or project you were working on that directly relates to the topic of your presentation. For example: “I’ve had the pleasure of working with NXP Semiconductors for the past three years. Just last week we encountered a problem with our logistical database...” and then lead into your presentation about a new software that will solve everyone’s logistical hiccups.",
      "It’s best to have a plan for how you will introduce yourself so you don’t get lost or confused when you’re on stage. It’s even better if you can write your plan down so you can review it beforehand or refer to it during your presentation. You can write down every sentence if you’d like, especially for practicing the introduction. When it’s time to present, it’s probably best to just write down a few notes or key words to remind you of what you want to say so you don’t just read off your note cards. Practicing your introduction out loud will help you speak with the right intonation and at the right pace so your message will be clear and interesting. You can also time yourself and add or remove certain parts of your introduction until you’ve got it just right. Ask your friend for constructive feedback and advice on how to improve. Practicing out loud will also help you gain confidence. If you don’t have a friend to watch your presentation, record yourself on video and play it back later to refine your presentation skills. It can be uncomfortable to watch yourself on video, but it will help you nail your introduction. You can even record your whole presentation. Keep recording and re-recording until you are happy with it. Then you know the audience will be happy too. You will want to make a good first impression with your introduction, so be sure you know what is expected of you and what might be frowned upon. Research the local culture where you will be speaking: what do they normally wear in the industry there? Do they introduce themselves by first name only, or with their first and last name? Be mindful of international customs too. In some places, it’s not appropriate to use humor. If you are unsure about your audience, leave the humor out. The best resource to learn about the local culture is the locals themselves. If you have a contact where you will be speaking, ask them about customs, dress code, and how humor is usually received. If you don’t know anyone personally, try searching in industry-specific online forums. Find YouTube videos of presentations given in the area that are relevant to your industry.",
      "Playing music as you walk up to the presentation area and for a few seconds before you start to speak shares your personality and gets the audience’s attention. This works best if you can reference the lyrics or artist as the music fades and you begin your presentation.  If you don’t have music that can tie to your presentation, you can use a song with the theme of beginning. For example, if you are presenting at a sales meeting, play some soft jazz as participants enter. Then, when it’s time for you to start, play the Black Eyed Peas chorus of “Let’s Get it Started” to get your audience’s attention. You can then open with an energetic “Good morning!” or “Good Afternoon” as the music ends. Remember to choose music that’s appropriate to the event. An academic conference may not be the best place for pop music, for example (unless you are presenting research on pop music, of course). Share a short, relevant quote before you say your name. This can get your audience interested in the topic. It’s even better if the author of the quote is a big name in the industry you are speaking to. The audience will recognize the name and it will lend credibility to your presentation.  For example, if you are presenting on the design of a new user-friendly coffee machine, you may start your presentation by referencing Elon Musk: “Any product that needs a manual to work is broken,” and then go on to say “My name is Laurie Higgens, and my coffee machine doesn’t come with a manual.” Speak briefly about your relevant experience and qualifications, and then dive into presenting your design. Avoid cliche or overused motivational quotes the audience has probably already heard many times. Be sure to correctly cite your quote. Starting by presenting a statistic that illustrates a problem that your presentation will address or attempt to solve can be a great attention-grabbing move. In many cases, the audience might not even realize there is a problem until you point it out to them. Once you do, they will be more alert and invested in hearing solutions from you.  For example, you might start with “According to Time magazine, Americans filled 4.3 billion prescriptions and doled out $374 billion on medicine in 2014.” Then, introduce yourself and your qualifications in medical research and transition into a presentation about how to prevent doctors from over prescribing medication to their patients. Remember to cite the source of your statistics. You will look more professional and reliable, and the audience will be able to follow up on the information if they wish. Asking a question transforms your audience into participants. Try to pick universal situations that everyone in the audience will have some experience with or opinion about. Make sure it ties directly into your presentation material, too.  If you are giving a presentation about a new airport security-friendly travel bag, try starting your presentation with “How many of you have ever stood in line at airport security and nearly missed your flight?” You can also invite your audience to close their eyes and imagine something as you lead up to your question. Don’t be discouraged if your audience doesn’t raise their hands when you ask a question. Sometimes these questions seem more rhetorical to an audience, or maybe they are just shy. You can often see signs that they are still engaging with the question if people are nodding or smiling after you ask it. Laughter can create an instant connection between a speaker and the audience. Start your introduction by making fun of yourself or exaggerating your own experiences in a humorous way. Don’t overdo the humor. Make it natural without trying to force a laugh. Be sure that any jokes or ironies you use are appropriate for the context in which you are speaking.  Try telling stories, showing pictures on a powerpoint, or using quotations. Being funny not only puts your audience at ease, but it also helps them remember you after the presentation. Giving a presentation can be a very lonely and isolating experience. If you have a small audience, however, you can involve them in your introduction. After you introduce yourself, ask the audience members to introduce themselves and state a question or concern that relates to your presentation topic. You will take a bit of pressure off yourself, keep your audience alert, and get to know them at the same time. For example, if you are making a presentation about a pizza delivery app, ask your audience members to tell their name, their favorite pizza topping, and a situation where they’ve had a particularly amazing or awful experience with food delivery."

      "It takes ten obsidian to make a Nether portal. Once you have enough for two portals, however, you can use a trick to get infinite obsidian without needing to find lava. . If you don't have a portal already, place obsidian blocks in a vertical frame 5 tall x 4 wide. Activate it by using a flint and steel on the lowest obsidian block. This trick may not work if there is another portal close by. The corners of the portal do not have to be obsidian. The Nether is a dangerous place, so prepare yourself if you haven't been before. You'll need the remaining ten obsidian blocks, but you might want to leave them safely behind and explore a safe route first. You'll need to travel a certain minimum distance in a straight, horizontal line (these numbers include a 3-block margin of safety just in case):  PC, Pocket Edition, and Console Edition \"large\" worlds: travel 19 blocks. Console Edition \"medium\" worlds: travel 25 blocks. Console Edition \"classic\" worlds (including all PS3 and Xbox 360 worlds): travel 45 blocks. If you have multiple Overworld portals, walk away from their coordinates. This trick will not work if you are too close to an existing portal. Build this in the Nether and activate it the same way you did the first one. When you walk through it, you should appear in a brand-new portal in the Overworld. If you appear next to a portal you already built, you did not walk far enough in the Nether. Go back to the Nether and break your portal with a diamond pickaxe, then rebuild it somewhere else. The portal that just appeared has fourteen obsidian blocks free for the taking. Mine these with a diamond pickaxe. Each time you walk through the Nether portal you just built, a new portal will appear in the Overworld. Mine this for free obsidian. Speed this up if you want a large amount of obsidian:  Use a bed to set your spawn near the permanent Overworld portal. Place a chest near the temporary Overworld portal. Stash the obsidian and diamond pickaxe in the chest after mining the portal. Kill yourself to return to spawn. Walk through the Nether again and exit the same portal to create a new one. Build a tunnel between the Nether portals to increase safety.",
      ". The End portal leads to the final, most challenging area in Minecraft. Locating it and activating is a long quest involving many Eyes of Ender. Try this only when you're ready to face the fearsome Ender Dragon. If you are on Pocket Edition, the End Portal will only work on infinite (not \"Old\") worlds running on version 1.0 or later (released December 2016). When you travel through the End portal, a platform of 9 obsidian blocks will appear for you to stand on. Mine it with the diamond pickaxe (though you may want to kill that dragon bothering you first). The island with the Ender Dragon has several tall towers with purple crystals atop them. The towers are made entirely of obsidian. You can return to the Overworld either by dying, or by defeating the Ender Dragon and walking through the exit portal that appears. Each time you walk through an End portal, the 9-block obsidian platform will respawn. This makes it one of the fastest ways to get infinitely recurring obsidian. The obsidian pillars do not respawn unless you respawn the dragon. To bring back the dragon, place four ender crystals on top of the exit portal that appeared when the dragon died.",
      "There is no crafting recipe for obsidian. Instead, any time flowing water hits a stationary lava \"source\" block, the lava turns into obsidian. You can find stationary lava in the following places:  Lava is easiest to find as \"lava falls\" in caves and ravines. Only the top block is a source block. Lava is very common in the bottom ten layers of the map. Dig down diagonally to avoid falling in it. Rarely, you can find lava lakes on the surface, but never more than about twenty blocks above sea level.  Some villages have a single smithy with two blocks of lava, visible from the outside. Craft a bucket out of three iron ingots. Use the bucket on the lava to scoop it up. You can only scoop up stationary blocks of lava, not flowing lava. In the computer crafting system, arrange the iron in a \"V\" shape. Make sure the hole is contained, and that nothing flammable is within two blocks in any direction. Wood, tall grass, and many other objects will catch fire near lava. Remember, only stationary (not flowing) lava will turn into obsidian. This means you will need one bucket of lava for every block of obsidian you want to make. Remember, without a diamond pickaxe you cannot mine the obsidian without destroying it. Make sure you want obsidian in that location before you continue. Use your now-empty bucket to scoop up water. Bring it to the lava pool you created and place the water above the lava so it flows down onto it. When the flowing water hits the lava, the lava will turn into obsidian. It's a good idea to build a temporary, non-flammable structure around the lava pool to prevent an annoying flood.",
      ". Obsidian is the only block that must be mined using a diamond pickaxe. Any lesser tool will destroy the obsidian if you try to mine it. Dig down almost to the bottom of the map and explore. It shouldn't take long to find a large pool of lava. Since you have a diamond pickax, you can turn the whole pool into obsidian at once, instead of transporting the lava in buckets. Create a small wall on one side of the pool, leaving room to put down a water block. This will reduce the chances of water pushing you into the lava. Put the water block down inside the fenced area, one level higher than the lava. It should flow down and turn the surface of the lake into obsidian. Stand at the edge and dig one block deep into the obsidian. There might be another layer of lava beneath it. If you're not careful, you may fall into this lava, or the obsidian bock item will fall before you can catch it, and burn up. If there is lava underneath the obsidian, stand next to the water and mine the obsidian at its edge. The water should rush in as you mine, turning the next layer into obsidian before the lava can cause any damage. Continue to mine as much obsidian as you need, moving the water when necessary."

      "Starting a business is a big risk. You need to know what your strengths and weaknesses are going in so you can reduce the chance of failure.  In your current job, what are your strengths? Are you a behind-the-scenes type, making things work from behind a computer desk? Or are you out on the field, making connections and networking with others?  What do you genuinely enjoy about your current job? People tend to be more successful in jobs they truly love. Do you love attending conferences? Running meetings? Are the sort of person suited for a leadership position? If so, starting your own business may be a good plan for you.  Ask co-workers and colleagues to give an honest assessment of you. It can be hard to self judge so ask someone you trust what they think your best qualities as a worker are. This can help you see what role you can play in your own company and what roles you should assign to others. Are you looking for a side business, something to do for fun and make a little extra money? Or are you looking for something that could potentially replace your current job? Starting your own business, regardless of the size, is a huge commitment and carries a lot of risk. Spend some time assessing how much of yourself you'll willing to put into this new endeavor. If you don't have experience with running a business, consider getting educated. Even if you already have a degree, taking extra classes or pursuing some kind of supplementary training can help.  Consider going back to school for something like an associate's degree in business, marketing, or managing. Associate's degrees tend to be only two years and the course load may be less strenuous. If you can't commit to getting another degree, consider taking a few business classes at a local college. There are also courses in business and start up companies offered online, which can be convenient if you have existing obligations.",
      "The key to starting a solid business is figuring out what you're interested in. Many people desire to start their own company because they want to pursue their passions. The first step to making a decision about forming your own business is listing your own interests.  Take a sheet of paper and start jotting down your interests. You can start with the very obvious. For example, what do you like to do on the weekends? Do you read? Go hiking? Play sports?  Reach back a little. What were you interested in before you got the job you have now? Did you minor in literature in college? Did you used to knit or engage in another hobby? Is there anything you miss doing that once captivated you? Once you've determined your interests, now it's time to explore your skills. What are you good at? What do you think you could contribute to the world?  People tend to have surprising skill sets unrelated to their field of work. Jon Stewart was an outstanding soccer player. Neil Patrick Harris is an accomplished magician. Do you have a special skill unrelated to your field of work? Do you, say, quilt on the weekends? Is there any way these skills could be made into a business model?  Make a list of abstract skills as well. Take out a piece of paper and write at the top \"These are seven things I'm good at\" and proceed to list your most marketable skills. For example, \"I am a good problem solver\" or \"I know how to stay calm in a crisis.\" The most successful business models fill in the gaps of an existing market. That is, they figure out what service or product is missing from an existing in demand industry. Consider what's missing in a field of interest to you.  Once again, making a list can help. Write a list of 5 products or services that would be useful to you but do not currently exist. Think about moments when, driving your car, watching your TV, or using some electronic device, you wished for a specific feature not on the market. Keep in mind this may take a few days. A frequent complaint of the middle school essay topic \"My Most Memorable Moment\" is that when forced to think of something memorable on the spot many people's minds go blank. While you might come up with product ideas all the time, when you push yourself to write them down you might find you've forgotten quite a few. Take a couple of days to think about it, keeping your list on hand if an idea comes to you in a free moment. A lot of anecdotal evidence speaks to the fact multimillion dollar ideas come at unexpected moments. The concept for Netflix, for example, began when Reed Hastings got a $40 late fee at his local video rental store. He wondered why movie rental companies couldn't work like health clubs, where you get charged a flat fee for using a given product. This is where he began to formulate the idea for his idea for an online DVD rental company. Pay attention to the world around you. Carry at notebook at all times. When you have a moment, like Hastings, where you wish things could work slightly differently write that down. A great idea could come of this later on.",
      "A sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure available. In a sole proprietorship, you are the sole owner of your business and entitled to all the profits and also responsible for any debts and losses. You do not have to do anything special to form a sole proprietorship. You just need to be the only owner of the company and the status is set.  The main advantages of a sole proprietorship is that it's easy and inexpensive to form. You also have full control of the company and tax preparation is fairly easy.  The main drawback to a sole proprietorship is that there is no legal separation between you and your business. This makes you liable for all debts an obligations. As you can't sell stock as a sole proprietorship, it can be difficult to raise funds for expenses. It can also be very stressful to handle all responsibilities alone. If you're worried about too much responsibility and liability, consider a partnership or LCC. In these arrangements, you're more protected and it may be easier to raise money for expenses. In a partnership, two or more people share ownership and responsibility of a business. In an LCC, your business would be a hybrid of a corporate structure and a partnership.  In a general partnership, you and another business partner share responsibility equally. In some types of partnerships, like a limited partnership, one person has slightly more control than the other. The main advantages of partnerships are they're easy and inexpensive to form, commitment is shared, you can find someone whose skill set compliments yours, and partnerships tend to attract more competent employees. The drawbacks are you will still have a lot of liability, disagreements between partners can hurt business, and profits are shared.  In an LCC, you're not an owner but a member and the way the structure is set up limits your liability. This is the main advantage to the LCC structure. Other advantages include less record keeping and profit sharing is far more flexible. Drawbacks include the fact LLCs can dissolve if too many members drop out and the self employment taxes associated with this structure can be complicated. Forming a corporation can be a complicated process. However, forming a corporation can make running your business easier. Consider the corporate model when making a decision about your business.  The main advantage of a corporation is that you save a lot on taxes. Tax rates for corporations are generally lower. Your business will also have an independent life, separate from you, which limits your personal liability.  The biggest drawback about corporations it that operating processes are much stricter. Shareholders also have compensation requirements that can be difficult to meet if you're a smaller company.",
      "An easy way to start your own business is to buy up an existing franchise. Franchises are well-known chains, such as McDonald's, that allow independent owners to purchase and operate a location.  Before you start a franchise, do your research. You'll have to follow certain corporate guidelines, so make sure the corporations overall ethics match your goals as a business owner. See if the type of franchise generally performs well in your area. Understand you have less freedom as a franchise owner. You have to follow guidelines based on layout, designs, prices, specials, and other aspects of your business. On the upside, however, you'll receive support from the corporation through training sessions, corporate seminars, and networking opportunities.  Read your contract carefully. Contracts for corporations often benefit the franchiser more than the franchisee. Make sure you can feasibly make money running your franchise. If you're running a business on the side, running an online business can be convenient. You'll also have a more flexible schedule and slightly more creative control.  You do have to know a bit about web design in order to start an online business. You'll probably have to register a domain name, design and website, and advertise and market yourself. If you have an existing background in online media and marketing, an online business might be a good choice for you.  There are also separate regulations for online businesses, based on your state. Contact a lawyer who specializes in internet law to ask about policies if you're interested in starting a business online. Retail is a viable business type in which you sell goods and services. Retail is somewhat on decline due to the convenience of buying products online, but clothing items and other items that need to be tried on tend to sell better in a physical store.  Retail items tend to do well when they initially open up. Customers are usually drawn in within a couple of weeks. Procedures for taxes and initial opening are less rigid. Having a physical presence also helps you stay in consumer's minds.  It can be expensive to maintain a retail outlet as opposed to other businesses as you have to buy your supplies. Scheduling is more rigid, as you need to be physically in the store waiting for customers. If you're interested in self-employment, consulting is a fairly straight forward business type. Consulting also allows for a more flexible schedule and can be done on the side while you keep a more stable job.  Consulting tends to pay fairly high. This means fewer working hours. Having consulting experience also looks good on a resume for future employment opportunities. There are also many chances to network and grow your business.  The main downside of consulting is that it does not always provide a steady income. It also takes a lot of time and money to become a consultant. You will also have to take care of your own benefits and taxes."

      "As soon as you know that you need to cancel the shower, start planning how best to inform everyone. The sooner you let them know, the less disturbance it will cause for them and their schedule. Of course, if something unexpected occurs and you have to cancel at the last minute, your friends and family should understand. If the reason is painful, you may not want to share details with everyone who was invited to your baby shower. Plan the reason that you will give for why you are canceling. For those you are less close to, you can write a card or email saying something like “Dear Cynthia, I’m writing to let you know that my baby shower on August 19th has been canceled. I’m sorry for any inconvenience that this causes, and I hope to see you soon! All the best, Lisa.” If you feel comfortable sharing the details of your situation, consider letting your guests know why you're canceling. Your guests should understand and be empathetic. This may bring you all closer, and can help you feel supported in whatever you’re going through. If you are canceling the shower several weeks in advance, send cards out to your guests by regular mail. You can create a notice using a computer program such as Microsoft Word or Adobe InDesign, or you can write the cards out individually if you have the time. Consider using cardstock to print or write the cards. If you have to cancel only a week or two before the shower, it may be too late to send cards by mail. Instead, send an email to all of the guests letting them know that the shower has been canceled. Emailing the guests is also a great option if you are trying to save money, since you won’t have to pay for cardstock and postage. If you need to cancel the shower at the last minute, calling will be the fastest way to ensure that all of your guests know that there won’t be a shower. It will be more difficult to give no reason for the cancellation over the phone, so prepare what you would like to say in advance. You can leave a voicemail telling the person the news if they don’t answer.  Regardless of how far in advance you are canceling, consider calling your close friends to let them know, rather than sending a card or email. On the phone, you could say something like, “Hi Cynthia! It’s Lisa. I’m sorry for the short notice, but we’ve actually decided to cancel my baby shower. There is just so much going on with preparing for the baby’s arrival that we’ve decided to wait. I will keep you updated if we reschedule!” If you choose not to share a reason, you could say, “Hi Cynthia! It’s Lisa. I’m sorry for the short notice, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we’ve decided to cancel my baby shower.\" If it is too distressing or overwhelming for you to inform all of the guests, ask a close friend or your partner to help you make phone calls, send cards, or send emails. Depending on when you cancel, your guests may have already purchased gifts for you. In your cancellation card, email, or phone call, you may want to give them ideas of what to do with those gifts. Tell them to either return them, or donate them to a charity that accepts baby supplies.",
      "If you asked a caterer to provide food for your shower, let them know of the cancellation as soon as you can. Each company has a different policy—some need only a few hours’ notice, while some may need a couple of weeks. Regardless of the policy, don’t hesitate to call them and explain your situation to see if they will offer you a refund. If you were planning to host the shower at a venue other than your home, call them or drop by to explain that the shower needs to be canceled. Similar to canceling a caterer, many places will be able to sympathize with your situation and will be understanding. Just be kind and honest as you let them know that you will no longer need to use their venue. If you already made a deposit for the venue, you can ask about a refund if needed. Many decorations, linens, and party favors may be able to be returned. If you purchased items that you won’t need and haven’t opened, try returning them to the store where you bought them. If the items were opened, try finding a local charity to donate them to.  Homeless shelters may find cups handy, and a charity shop, such as Salvation Army or Goodwill, will appreciate linens. If any food or drinks can’t be returned, see if you can freeze them or share them with friends.  You can also try selling slightly used or opened items on eBay."

    ],
    "document": [
      "The most notable sign of a dog with kennel cough is a persistent cough. The dog will cough continuously with a distinctive “goose honk” sound. Many time this is the only sign in the dog, with it appearing healthy otherwise. However, this cough lingers on for weeks and some dogs will also show other signs such as:  Gagging or coughing up a white foamy phlegm Fever Discharge from the nose Watery eyes Decreased appetite Occasionally, kennel cough can make a dog susceptible to developing pneumonia. This will make a dog experience more severe symptoms, including lethargy, difficulty breathing and, even in a few cases, death. It's important to limit the risk of spreading the disease, even if you are not sure if your dog actually has it. This is the responsible thing to do.  Keep your dog away from dog parks or facilities that care for dogs, such as doggie day cares and boarding facilities, until your vet has cleared your dog's health. Pick up your dog's feces. You should probably do this whether your dog is infected or not but infected feces cause a health hazard. An uninfected dog having contact with infected feces is one way that the infection can spread. Kennel cough generally will run its course in 1 to 3 weeks with no treatment needed. However, some owners are annoyed by the constant coughing, so drugs to suppress the cough and reduce windpipe inflammation can be given through a prescription from a veterinarian.  In more severe cases, antibiotics which are effective against Bordetella can be given. A dog which is actively coughing should not do any heavy exercise such as running, as this will aggravate the cough. Food and water intake should be monitored and encouraged to make sure the dog keeps eating and drinking. Collars used during leash walking may press against the dog’s windpipe causing severe irritation. Using a harness instead will help prevent this from happening.",
      "The primary way to prevent kennel cough is to keep your dog vaccinated. The core vaccine also includes vaccination against common viruses that contribute to kennel cough development. There is also a vaccine effective against Bordetella bronchiseptica, which can also cause kennel cough. Your veterinarian will let you know which vaccinations are more important for your dog to receive. Just doing the vaccination one time is not effective forever. You need to get your dog a booster of its vaccination on a regular basis. In general, the first booster is given after one year, and then subsequent boosters are given every three years.  New strains of kennel cough occur regularly. Getting your dog's vaccination updated can increase the likelihood that your dog will be protected. Because of the many causes of kennel cough, vaccination will not guarantee 100% that your dog will not get the disease. However, it will reduce the chances considerably. Dogs and puppies that are exposed to a lot of other dogs are at increased risk for this disease. This contact can occur at dog parks, groomers, puppy classes, obedience classes, and boarding at kennels. Keeping puppies isolated from other dogs, except litter mates and the mother, until they can get vaccinated is a good idea. Puppies don't usually get vaccinated against the causes of kennel cough until they are around four months old. However, some of the intranasal drops can be given to puppies as young as three weeks of age. When dogs drink out of a common bowl, droplets from an infected dog’s nasal and mouth secretion can contaminate the water and bowl with Bordatella. When an uninfected and unvaccinated dog laps the water, it can contract the bacteria and come down with kennel cough. To avoid this completely don’t share water or food bowls and wash them frequently in hot, soapy water. The same applies to toys that dogs may share while they are playing."

      "Describe who you are in the first sentence. Then, mention your goal or objective in the second sentence. Finish the summary with a sentence about why you’re a valuable candidate for the position. A 3-sentence summary will help recruiters quickly understand who you are and what you have to offer.  For example, your 3-sentence summary could go something like “Writer with over 5 years experience at major publications. Looking to research and write about digital marketing trends. Brings solid understanding of editorial standards and a track record of meeting deadlines.\" If you don't have a lot of job experience or skills, leave the 3-sentence summary off of your resume. Instead of focusing on the responsibilities you had at your old jobs, focus on the things you accomplished at them instead. Ask yourself what your 2-3 best achievements were at each of your previous jobs and write them down. Then, include 1 or 2 of them after each job you have listed on your resume. For example, instead of writing “Was responsible for reorganizing shelves in company stockroom,” you could write “Implemented successful new organization system in company stockroom.” That way they’ll be easier for recruiters to understand. Whenever you’re listing an achievement, try to attach a number or percentage to it. Don’t make it complicated and use too many numbers. Stick with one number or percentage per achievement. For example, instead of writing “Helped increase traffic to company website,” you could write “Increased traffic to company website by 45 percent.” Action verbs imply that you took initiative and accomplished something, which will look good to recruiters. If any of the bullet points on your resume start with a phrase like “Responsible for” or “In charge of,” rephrase them so they start with an action verb. Some action verbs you could use on your resume are: arranged, delivered, assisted, created, formed, organized, produced, eliminated, lead, transformed, and developed.",
      "Look for specific skills, kinds of experience, and keywords listed in the job ad and write them down. If there are any educational requirements, make sure you note those too. Then, when you're making your resume, focus on including those things to show the recruiter you're the right candidate for the job. Try copying and pasting the job description into a word cloud generator. Word cloud generators take all the words in a body of text and show you which words are the most common. If the generator tells you that the term \"self-starter\" appears a lot in the job ad, you'll know to incorporate that skill into your resume. Don’t use the same resume for every job you apply to. Recruiters want to see that you’re the right fit for the specific job they’re trying to fill. When you find a job you're interested in, take the time to update your resume so it reflects the skills and experience the job ad is calling for.  To save yourself time, have a \"base\" resume saved on your computer. Then, whenever you find a job you're interested in, you can just tweak the base resume so it's tailored to the job. Save your updated resume as a different file so you don't lose your base resume. For example, if you're applying for a job that calls for excellent customer service skills, you could take your base resume and move \"customer service\" to the top of your list of skills. You could also add more details to your descriptions for your previous jobs about how you excelled at customer service in those roles. Many companies use electronic tracking systems that look for specific keywords in applicant resumes. If you don’t use those keywords, your resume could be overlooked. To find out which keywords to use, search online for a list of keywords commonly used in the industry you're applying to. Just search something like \"resume keywords for financial advisor.\" For example, recruiters looking to fill a financial position could be looking for keywords like \"profit,\" \"accounting,\" \"budgeting,\" and \"compliance.\" If you're responding to a job ad that emphasizes work experience, use a chronological resume. If you're applying for a job that requires a lot of specific skills, a functional resume may be a good choice. If the job description focuses on both experience and practical skills, use a combination resume to demonstrate that you have both.  For example, if you're applying to a job that requires 3 years of landscaping experience, make a chronological resume by listing your work history at the top of your resume, starting with your most recent job in landscaping. If you're applying for an entry-level computer programming job where you need to know how to use a variety of computer programs, make a functional resume. At the top of your resume, list your experience working with the different computer programs, as opposed to your work history. If you're applying for a graphic design job that requires 1 year of experience and experience using different design programs, make a combination resume. Start the resume with a list of your skills and experience working in graphic design programs, and follow that section with your employment history.",
      "Paragraphs are harder to skim through than bullet points, so recruiters may not be seeing all the information you want them to see. If any of your job descriptions are written in paragraph form, break them up into several bullet points. Keep each bullet point between 1-2 sentences long. To shorten your resume, make your writing more concise. Delete any unnecessary information, like dates and descriptions for jobs you had over 15 years ago. If you’re using a large font, make it smaller (but not so small that it’s hard to read). Recruiters like to skim resumes, and they’ll be more likely to look yours over if it’s only 1 page. Put it in bold font so it’s easy for recruiters to find. Make sure it includes your phone number, email address, city and zip code (you can leave out your full mailing address). Avoid colorful, crazy fonts that will distract from the content of your resume. Try to use the same font throughout your whole resume so it looks neat and polished.  Make your headlines bold and slightly larger to help them stand out. Some simple fonts you can use for your resume are: Times New Roman, Georgie, Garamond, Arial, Century Gothic, Tahoma, and Bell MT. Search online for \"free resume builder.\" There are also resume builders you can pay for to get access to more premium features. Once you find a software or app you like, input the information from your resume into the builder so it can help you organize it all in an effective way. Then, save the resume you made and use it to apply for jobs. Some resume builders you can try are https://www.resume-now.com, https://www.myperfectresume.com, or https://www.canva.com/create/resumes."

      "Hold a clean washcloth under cool, running water until it is soaked. Then, wring it out over the sink and fold the cloth in half. Lay the cloth across the back of your neck and keep it there for 5 to 10 minutes. This may be soothing after you throw up. It can also help to lower your body temperature, which may rise after you throw up. Odors like tobacco smoke, strong perfumes, or the scent of spicy cooking can all cause vomiting if you’re already nauseous. Avoid your exposure to these kinds of scents as much as possible until you’ve gone at least 24 hours without vomiting. Note that hot foods also tend to have stronger scents than cold foods, so avoiding hot foods is also a good way to prevent food smells from triggering vomiting. These include aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and some blood pressure drugs. Consult with your doctor before stopping any oral medications you were taking for a different condition before you started vomiting. Some antibiotics have also been known to cause nausea. However, you should never stop taking antibiotics before consulting with your doctor. Aromatherapy is when you inhale the scent of essential oils, such as by adding a few drops of essential oil to a diffuser or when you light a scented candle. Some essential oils that may help to relieve nausea include: Ginger Peppermint Lavender Fennel seed Lemon Studies have shown that slow, deep breathing can activate your parasympathetic nervous system and decrease feelings of nausea or an upset stomach. In a comfortable, seated position, close your eyes and inhale deeply through your nose for 5 seconds. Then, slowly exhale through your nose for 7 seconds. Repeat this process until your nausea starts to disappear. Try to fill your lungs completely when you inhale to get the best results.",
      "Your stomach muscles are going to feel pretty sore after you finish throwing up, especially if you were vomiting a lot. Letting your stomach rest will reduce the risk of you vomiting again once you get back to eating. It’s okay to rinse your mouth out with a little bit of water to get rid of the taste of vomit after you throw up. Just try to avoid swallowing any of it for the first 15 minutes. Ginger has antiemetic properties, which means that it can help to stop nausea and vomiting. If you have some fresh ginger around, you can cut off a 0.5 in (1.3 cm) piece and chew on it or use it to make a cup of ginger tea. Cut off the skin with a knife and place the whole piece in your mouth if you want to chew on it, or place it into a mug and pour boiling water over it. Steep the ginger in the hot water for 10 minutes and then sip the tea slowly. You should wait until you’ve been able to keep liquids down for 8 hours without vomiting before you try eating anything. The first things you try to eat should be light, starchy foods that are easy to digest, such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, also known as the BRAT diet.  The BRAT (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast) Diet is the recommended diet for people suffering from an upset stomach. Tea and yogurt are also easy foods to eat after vomiting. This will put less of a strain on your stomach than eating a big meal every 6-8 hours. Also, limit your meals to foods served cold or at room temperature for the first 24 hours after vomiting to minimize the risk of upsetting your stomach again.  Some examples of foods to try to eat at this stage include mashed potatoes (that aren’t too hot), rice, cream soups made with low-fat milk, pretzels, or low-fat pudding. Don’t eat any fried, greasy, acidic, or sweet foods at this point, as these types of foods can irritate your stomach. Wait until you’ve been vomit-free for 24-48 hours before trying to tackle fried chicken or a glazed donut. Caffeinated and alcoholic drinks and tobacco products can all irritate your stomach and potentially cause you to start vomiting again. To be safe, avoid consuming these products for at least 24-48 hours after you’ve stopped vomiting. If you’re lactose intolerant or otherwise sensitive to dairy, you should also refrain from eating any dairy products until you’ve gone 24 hours without vomiting.",
      "Your body will need to rest to not only recuperate from the act of vomiting, but also get over whatever caused you to vomit in the first place. Moving around a lot while you’re nauseous may also cause you to start vomiting again, so it’s best to let yourself rest until your nausea is entirely gone. If you have friends or family who can help take care of you while you’re recovering, ask if they’d be willing to stay with you to help until your nausea is gone. If you’ve done all you can through self-care to try to control your nausea and you still find yourself going through frequent bouts of vomiting, you may need some help from medication. Talk to your doctor about being prescribed an anti-nausea medication to get recurring nausea and vomiting under control.  Examples of commonly prescribed anti-nausea medications include Phenergan and Zofran. Note that some over-the-counter medications that are used to treat upset stomachs, such as Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate, probably won’t stop you from vomiting if you have a stomach virus. Although vomiting and nausea usually go away after 24 hours of self-care, they can sometimes be signs of more serious illnesses. Seek medical attention if your vomiting lasts for more than 24 hours, there’s blood in your vomit, or you start to experience severe abdominal pain. You should also contact a doctor if you have nausea without vomiting that persists for more than 48 hours."

      "Work should be an extension of who you are, not a chore you slog through every day. Finding your passion is not always easy, but that doesn't make it any less worth doing. This needs to be one of the guiding principles of your life if you want to make it better-- you only have one life to live, so spend it doing things you love.  Make a list of your favorite activities. What is most important to you in life, friends, family, fulfillment, a good job? Plan around these important causes. While everyone has to do things \"just to survive,\" these jobs will be easier to get through if you are also working towards a long-term dream. Make a list of tangible, real goals and commit to achieving them. This gives you milestones to reach for and makes bettering your life an attainable adventure, not a series of confused stabs in the dark. Goals can be big, like running your own company, or small, like exercising every day. Just make sure you know what you want to change before you start changing. Once you have goals it's time to make them a reality, one small step at a time. Draft a list of the things you need to do to make your dreams come true. For example, if you want to be a TV show writer, you might:  Learn how to write scripts. Write and edit your first TV pilot. Submit your pilot to contests and fellowships. Move to LA to learn the industry. Keep writing new pilots until one gets picked up. The only way to improve is to learn, so find time to teach yourself something new every day. Be humble enough to ask for advice or guidance from friends and experts as you grow as a person and a professional.  Read/watch the news daily. Read a book. Learn a new word. Anything that makes you smarter than the day before is something to be proud of.  Even people happy with their jobs can benefit from continued education, as it makes you a better person with more insight and wisdom. Consider night school or online classes if you want to change careers but can't afford to quit work just yet. Listen more, talk less. You'll be surprised what people have to offer you. Work for the job you want, not the one you have. When your Manager/Boss realizes that you are eager to learn, you will move up the ladder in no time. Do the best you can on any project or assignment you are given and be willing to help your coworkers when they need a hand. If you exude positive, hardworking vibes, someone will eventually notice. Crafting a happy, fulfilling future does not take place overnight. Some experts have estimated that it takes 10,000 hours to reach true mastery in any subject, which means you have to work hard to reach the future you want. But if you are truly happy doing something, the work required to get there should not feel like a chore.  Focus on your goals and the steps needed to reach them. Celebrate little milestones on your way to your better future life. Know that setbacks happen, but handling them positively will bring your closer to your goals.",
      "A house, clean water, a loving family, friends, and food are all things that we often take for granted. So many people don't have these things so try to always remind yourself to be grateful. Be proud of your accomplishments, and be sure to thank people for their help and support.  Make a list of the things you are thankful for. Let people you love know you care for them, it will both make them feel loved and strengthen your bonds. Human beings are social animals, and we feed off of each other's positive energy. Find friends and family that make you feel good and make it a priority to hang out with them. Ring them for a chat after work or go shopping on the weekend. Go to your grandma's for Sunday Lunch. Spending time with them will make you happy, and vice versa. Make sure you are taking care of yourself with some quality \"me\" time. You don't have to examine your life or look for problems, just find a few hours each week to be by yourself, away from work or stress. Go for a walk/hike, listen to your favorite albums, or curl up with a good book. Being happy and confident by yourself is the first step to being happier in any situation. Life isn't perfect, and there will be hardship along the road. Don't feel like you need to ignore bad situations or tough times, as they won't go away when you do. Instead, try and learn what you can from negative experiences, finding the positives whenever possible. You are still alive, you still have people that love you, and you still have yourself. Pick up the pieces, learn your lesson, and move on. There is no better feeling than positively impacting somebody else's life. Whether this is something little, like helping an elderly person cross the road or carrying their bags, or something big, like tutoring someone or volunteering on weekends, being generous is proven to improve your own happiness. Exercising releases endorphins into the body to make you feel better, and improves performance in almost every aspect of life. Eating well is also a huge factor in bettering yourself as most of the \"healthy\" foods contain positive nutrients (vitamins and minerals) that contribute to better overall health. Take care of your body and your mind will thank you. Love yourself and good things will happen. Remind yourself that you are worthwhile and use the power of positive thinking to bring happiness into your life. Simply feeling confident in who you are attracts similar people, and everyone, from your boss to your spouse, will take note of your energy.",
      "Try and examine your life from a neutral perspective, without making excuses for bad behavior or over-praising good behavior. If you were your own friend, what advice would you give yourself? What would you want to change? What is going really well? Make a little list of your own \"pros\" and \"cons.\" Can you expand or spend more time on any of the good things, and can you eliminate some of the bad? Sometimes what we want or \"need\" to do is not really what is best for us. You need to learn to weed out things that drain your energy without giving you anything positive in return. For example, as much as you love your friends, going out to the bars the night before a big test is not always the best way to spend your evening. On the flipside, spending 2 weeks studying for a test and ignoring your friends can damage important relationships and lead to unwanted stress. Remember that you need to put your own health and happiness first -- no one will blame you for that. Make time in your day for the things that are important to you, but don't make yourself so busy that you can't be spontaneous every now and then. Having a schedule makes you more likely to stick to your goals and keeps you doing the things that matter the most to you. If, for example, you want to be a better writer, schedule 30 minutes each day to write. This makes it easier to tell someone you are busy when offered work or plans. Having some free time, however, makes it easier to fit in a last-minute plan here and there. If something makes you stressful, anxious, or upset, find a way to cut it out of your life. This isn't always easy, but it is necessary to make your life better overall. Examine the patterns in your life that make you unhappy and think of ways to improve them. Relationships, work, and bad habits should all be reflected on from time to time. Start your morning by getting up for the day with vibrant energy. Wake up early and prepare breakfast. Make sure you clean up your mess as you go. Do 15-20 minutes of exercise or yoga, read the paper, and ignore social media or TV for a moment. Starting your day with productive energy makes it much easier to get off on the right foot for a better life. You can't change what has already happened, so stop trying to try. Remind yourself every day that all you can do is work on the present, and make that your priority. This allows you to develop smart, effective habits that will, in time, make you a better person.  Practice meditation daily to focus your thoughts. Work on mindfulness techniques."

      "This all seems a little too logical, but you need to get these down in permanent ink in order to know what's the best size of venue, the right budget, the nature of presentations, amount (or type) of guests, and what strategies to employ for your specific event. So what's your ideal outcome? What do you want to get done?  Once you figure out what you're doing (celebrating, fundraising, educating, selling, proposing, etc.), think about why you're doing it. Knowing your motivations can help give you focus and drive. Having a few objectives can also help align you in the direction you need to be going. You can't keep trying to reach a goal that hasn't been set! When you have $4,000 and you're aiming for $5,000, that goal can push you through to the finish line. This is one of the most important factors in your event planning. Pick a date and time no one can make and it doesn't even matter how great an event you have planned. And pick a date and time that's too far into the future -- or coming up too soon -- and your guests will either forget about it or already have plans. The Goldilocks syndrome of event managing!  Ideally, you want to let your guests know about two weeks out. That gives them a good amount of time to not yet have plans and a good timeline for inviting them and reminding them once or twice before the time actually comes. So have your event be a few weeks into the future minimum, if you can swing it. Now that you have an idea of what you're doing and when you're doing it, you can start thinking about venues and approaching potential ones with a date and things you'll need. What kind of building do you want to host in and how will the space be managed? Are the guests to be sitting on chairs in rows, on benches or at tables, or on picnic rugs in the open? Will the weather pose a problem? Will there need to be room for dancing, speakers podium or a stage? If so, plan to ensure the event space is large enough.  It is always best to visit the site in advance and draw yourself a map of the area. This map can be used as a \"battle plan\" and allows you to sketch and allocate table space, service routes for food service, disabled access if required and exit routes, as well as how you will get the equipment into place. You should also mark where the power generator (if required), external equipment such a refrigerator, ice maker, barbecue or stoves (etc.) will be, as well as where power points and cables will be (which may be covered discreetly with a rug) and other safety hazards to address. Are legal and local government approvals required? In most instances approvals are required for a bar, but also for excessive noise, vehicle access and parking, building large enclosures such as a pavilion and other needs. How many people can your budget and venue handle? Some events are strictly ticket entry or invitation only, so it is easier to plan, but many events will have latecomers, or extras such as children, partners or friends. And keep in mind that the more guests you have, the more crew you need, too.   As it can be the biggest logistical problem it's always wise to ensure there adequate room for all people to move around at the site. In older establishments, they usually call the quantity of guests \"pax,\" so if working in a function centre and you see \"Pax 150\" it means 150 guests are expected. Hopefully you have a few people you can lean on to gauge together how much money you'll need for this event. Are you paying any staff? Renting equipment and your venue? Supplying food and drinks? Publishing pamphlets or postcards? Settle on a number that seems doable and cater your plan to it. You don't want to wind up paying out of your own pockets for this if you don't have to. You may be in a situation where you can get sponsorships or donations, but most of us aren't so lucky. If you don't foresee any more funds coming in, it's imperative that you cut corners when need be. Instead of having a catering team, form a BYO or a \"bring-a-plate\" function (catering is minimal, but you will need to provide a food table, bain maries and refrigerators). Instead of hiring a photographer, go around and take photos yourself. Get creative where need be! Organize your service team (even if they are friends and relatives or other volunteers) to handle different, relevant sections, even if you're not professionally running an event, but running a small family event. Good event management in a big scale is about organizing people to be in charge of individual areas of the event and making sure everyone knows what the plan is.  Your crew needs just as much advanced noticed as the teams you're hiring and your guests. Assign them duties as soon as possible, giving them preference if you can. And try to have a few people on standby -- there are always a few flakes in every bunch. No more planning can happen until know just what's going to happen at your event. When are the speakers speaking? Are there games, activities, or presentations that should be scheduled? How much time will the guests need to eat? Work out a fairly detailed timeline for the day's activities.  Always leave a little wiggle room; no event will be exactly as you planned, down to the minute. People run late, speeches take longer than expected, the line for the buffet doesn't shuffle along, you name it. So while you need a good idea of what's happening, understand that it's for organizational purposes and nothing is written in stone.",
      "Be the first to arrive at the site to oversee the preparations. Make sure everyone files in accordingly and start making phone calls if not. Assist those who need assisting, direct those who need directed, and get out of the way when you need to. No injuries until after the event, please.  You'll feel a little calmer if you make a checklist. Have a portion for your crew, a portion for hired out crews, a portion for decorations and basic set-up, and a portion for equipment. When all is checked off, that's when you have time to breathe. Do not be afraid to delegate. The main stressor when it comes to an event is time. To save it, all hands need to be on deck -- or different decks. If someone isn't being as useful as they could be, give them something better to do. It's your job. It's not you being bossy or overstepping your boundaries; it's you doing what you're supposed to do.  When you delegate, be firm but polite. Say, \"Juan, I need you over here right now to help out with the caterers. Thank you.\" Your crew needs to jive together as much as the event does. Keep everything moving swimmingly by being the leader that you need to be. This means making sure that things are kept to schedule and assisting or having backup plans if it falls behind -- and being okay with it. If you start stressing out, you'll lose your head. Nothing good will come of that. So when that speech runs ten minutes over and the speaker is ignoring your blatant distress signals or your attempt at feigning a stroke to create a diversion, relax. You'll just adjust the appetizer and no one will notice. Event intact. Things happen. They do. They have a bad habit of happening. There's no way you can predict everything, and the sooner you accept this the better. A calm, collected event manager can do wonders for any event; a strung-out, tense one cannot. So relax and go with the flow -- it'll all be over soon! Check that guest numbers and needs are still correct on the day of the event and advise the service team of any changes at the earliest possible opportunity You should be the first set of eyes that notices if anything goes wrong.  Consult with your clients to see how they are feeling; they may be excited, nervous, worried, bored or mentally drained or have some issue on their plate that in some cases you may soothe with understanding, some kind words and practical assistance. It is wise to use this time to rejuvenate the enthusiasm in guests and the team where appropriate. Trust and respect your service team to look after themselves -- if you've given them a good base, they should be fine. Offer assistance if needed, but they should be experienced enough not to need any help at all. Here are a few things to keep in mind:   Act as a concierge or receptionist at the beginning, meeting and greeting each guest (if appropriate) as they come. Hand over the reins to the MC when the event starts. The management role will be more active problem solving and ensuring all the back of housework such as food preparation and service runs to plan. Keep an eye on the guests and keep contact with the MC often and discreetly in case they want (or need) to change plans. Keep a respectful distance from the key guests - after all, the event is all about them - but be easily accessible by checking at appropriate moments how they feel the event is going, as well as any problems, requests or suggestions they may have. You want all your guests to remember how awesome of a time they had. Actually, you probably want more than that. A visit to a website, future donations, word of mouth buzz, whatever. To ensure that your event is the legend it deserves to be, give a takeaway. Whether it's a picture, a flyer, or a pen, having something to remind your guests of the event is a good way to make sure you stay in their minds. Most events tend to run themselves when they start, but all the hard work is the preparation that no-one sees. So pat yourself on the back because you deserve it! Okay, back to tearing it down. The job's not over yet!  After the event, arrange a time to meet and thank your client. It is always recommended to offer an appropriate and thoughtful gift to remember their time with you, as it is these small touches that make the experience richer and may make them recommend your services in future. If you gave a gift during the event, such as in a gift registry with the other guests, then a thoughtful after present such as flowers, a framed photograph of your favourite moment at their event (such as cutting the ribbon, or the climax of the show, or the award ceremony, or the wedding kiss, or blowing out the candles on a cake, etc), or some other gift may be appropriate. Just like mom said, \"Leave it in the same condition you found it in,\" the same goes for your venue. Everything needs to be just like it was before you got there -- this is one business where you don't want to burn any bridges. So let your crews know it's time to tear down and don't let them leave until all is taken care of. And you need to pitch in too!  This is nice, sure, but it also prevents you from being billed any more than you should be. Many places will tack on extra cleaning fees if they find any opportunity to do so. So make it as spic and span as possible to avoid the hidden costs. You may need to arrange returning hired or borrowed equipment and later on consulting with the client about their experience. Even if unpaid after the event, thank them for the opportunity to have such a great experience to run an event with them. Can you get a business card of theirs?  Thank your crew, too! Make sure all parties are paid (and all parties have paid up), file receipts, and get everyone taken care of. You should be one of the last ones out the door -- and make sure it's locked behind you.",
      "Well before the event, it's a good idea to scope out your venue and figure out how everything will be set up. You may need to make additional arrangements to accommodate the floor plan -- extension cords, lighting, etc. And if it's hard to find for you, it'll probably be hard to find for your guests, so be sure to take that into account, too!  If it's up to you, map out where everything will go and when. If there isn't room for it, it needs to go. Talk to the venue's manager about what help they're willing and able to pitch in and if there are any city codes you need to abide by, especially in the case of emergency. Your crews are going to be working hard. In order to show them your appreciation and to keep them on top of their game, make them a kit to give at the top of the event. Bottles of water, granola bars, chocolates, little tokens of appreciation, whatever you see fit. It'll up morale from the get-go, too.  Consider getting them badges or a little party favor to make them feel part of the event and to remember it by. And make sure they stay fed and watered! Always think of your team as resources you want to be able to use in the future. Before the event, it's important to have all your ducks in a row. Be sure to provide clear instructions to your crew on how to get to the site and give them your number or preferably a business card with contacts to call if they need directions. Does anybody have any questions? No? And break!  Make sure everyone is comfortable with their duties. Some people may not be willing to vocalize this, so read them if at all possible. Do they seem sure and confident? If not, reassure them, go over their duties, and ask them a few basic questions. When in doubt, pair them with a more able partner. Your own personal organization is just as important as the event's organization. If you're organized and things go haywire, all can still be fine. But if you're not, hell can break loose. Here's a few ways to prepare yourself:   Make a contact sheet with phone numbers and addresses. The baker thought you were picking up the cake? No problem. Call Ashley who lives nearby -- she can swing by the bakery on her way to the event. Make a checklist. As teams file in, you'll know what goods, what equipment, and what bodies are missing. Prepare invoices and billing as necessary. The more on top of your game you are now, the fewer problems you'll have later. Is it likely there will be frequent artistic changes? Weddings are infamous for clients making last minute design changes so it is wise to recommend to your clients a cut-off date for changes. Usually 1 week before the event is leaving it very close, but it gives the client some flexibility and avoids last minute changes coming too late to be practical or cost effective to implement. If it is simple, subtle or basic changes using already sourced decorations, then it is not unreasonable to accede to change requests. Be as accommodating as possible in what is usually a very emotionally anticipated event.",
      "Because how else will people know to come?! You gotta send them invites! And this isn't something you should scrimp on, either. Your invitation is the face of your event. The first impression people get of what to expect and if they should even come. It's gotta be good.  Consider your typical invitations -- postcards, flyers, etc. But also go paperless: email, newsletters, Facebook, Twitter, and sites like Eventbrite that serve as invitations, guest trackers, and a calendar. Correction: if you're trying to get as many people to come as possible, definitely use Facebook and Twitter. If you're trying to keep it to VIPs only, avoid these platforms. That's just asking for trouble. You'll need a headcount to know just how much and what you all need, so keep track! It probably won't be the number that actually show up, but it should give you a general idea. Websites designed for event managing can help you do this -- but so can Facebook and an Excel spreadsheet. Will you need to find, hire, book or delegate  photographers, builders, designers and decorators, guest speakers, sponsors, entertainers or bands, officiates or clergy, dancing partners or demonstrations? It is wise to include them in catering and seating calculations so that a meal and a table place is provided for them if appropriate or required, too.   Are food and beverages provided? If so, know who will be on the team to look after the cooking, serving and cleaning. What type of food do you need to serve? Are there likely to be guests with allergies, vegetarian or vegan needs, diabetics, religious needs such as halal or kosher, gluten-free, (etc)? And will there be infants, young children or the aged or injured who cannot eat solid foods? Are entertainment and logistics organised? This part might be delivery of music equipment, pavilions or tents and decorative effects or stage management you will need, such as a microphone and amplifiers, lighting, power outlets, projectors and screens for slideshows, smoke machines or other stage magic effects such as mirrors, banners and corporate signage, etc.If you subcontract a company to be entertainers, consult with them to ensure they are able to supply and set-up their own equipment as well as where the stage and service sections will be on the site and what the schedule will be. This way you can find out what you may need to do to assist them.  Caterers, florists, entertainers and other important people appreciate as much time as possible to plan, as it is typically more expensive to obtain goods and staff for high urgency requests. The other advantage is should they not be able to keep your appointment, you have some time still to find an alternative. The MC doesn't always organise the event entirely, but they do host the event. It is usually a member of the party, who will organise speeches, announce events such as the meal courses, dancing, notable guests or entertainment. Liaise with this person often and keep them up-to-date. If they're any good, they'll be very helpful. Sometimes you may have to be the MC, in which case the job becomes much harder as you will need to keep working until it's all over. It then becomes important to set up your service team with their own group leaders so you can delegate most of the normal duties to them. When you hire a team, check and double-check that they're bringing the gear they need. In some cases, they may just be providing you bodies or goods and leaving it at that; you may need to source the equipment separately. It can be rented, bought, or even borrowed from your extensive social network. Go through your checklist from napkins to PA systems to extension cords.   Decorations are a huge part of any event. Table linens, flowers, gifts, candles, balloons, banners or backdrops for photography, red carpets, (etc) should always be sourced well in advance. One thing many rookies forget are the finer points of the facilities. Are there enough? Examples are toilets and bathrooms, car parking spaces, wheelchair access ramps, changing rooms, storage rooms and kitchen space, waste disposal bins, wine coolers, power access, etc. These are obstacles that are only workable if you foresee them well in advance.  Also think outside of your event: will transport and accommodation be required for international or out-of-town guests or delegates at hotels, as well as bookings and space made for their transport to get them to and from the event? Understanding the social hierarchy of your event -- if it's not truly yours -- is integral to knowing how to handle any situation. As it is essential that the client has confidence in you, you will need to find out:   Who the key guests are––this is usually straightforward when it is a celebration event––such as the bride and groom. The client is not always the key guest/s but may be part of their group, or not present at all. Who the host guests are––these people often act as hosts at their own tables and tend to be good socializes and motivators of guests. These people are useful to keep a convivial atmosphere and strike up a conversation if things turn quiet, encourage people to dance or to introduce people to other guests to make new friendships. These people should be reliable but are generally useful to know as they will keep you informed, may step in and be a guest speaker or MC for you in an emergency and these are the people overall who make the event flow the smoothest at the front line. Who the peacemakers are. You should be aware at all times who these key people are as you need to advise them of issues and involve them in the handling of issues and disputes where appropriate. This will generally be the head of the family, a caretaker, or head honchos or hired security. Who the decision maker is. For most cases it is yourself as manager, but when you must consult guests and it is not appropriate to involve the key guests (as they typically will be occupied being good hosts), find out who you should consult in an emergency. Ultimately it would be the person who pays the bill if you're charging for your services, or whomever you may deem as \"the client\" as the person having the final say on the matter.",
      "This one is a common issue, so it is best to be prepared. By and large, delays are understandably hard to avoid (such as unforeseen traffic issues) and are forgiven by guests who came on time. That being said, here are a few things you can do to do your best to keep it from happening:   Ensure that invitations are clear as to the time of the event and if requesting an RSVP, ensure that the time is confirmed. Communicate with (via your contact sheet) the MC, relevant guests (often the leaders of the party members), entertainers and kitchen staff as soon as you're aware of an issue you cannot resolve easily.  Should the delayed guests be the focus (such as the bride and groom), the usual methods are: Contact the delayed guest/s directly to check for an estimation. Advise the kitchen immediately of all developments so they can slow down or speed up to keep time. Refrain from making it known publicly that the event is being delayed because of certain guests (because the party will work that out on their own), but advise key hosts or members of the party that you have been made aware of the fact. Let them know what you intend to do, but allow the hosts to make a suggestion as they know the members of their party and what would be appropriate in the context. Maintain careful watch on the time in relation to speeches. If key guests are late, serve an additional appetizer (first course) and/or beverage early as this will prevent guests who came on time from becoming bored and will keep them occupied. For guests that are going to be delayed for more than is reasonable or possible (such as when serving food that simply cannot wait, such as souffles), start the event as planned and when the delayed guests arrive, start them at the next course of a meal (even if this is dessert). Organise an additional dance, game, speech or other form of entertainment (especially music), and ensure extra distractions, such as group or party photographs are done until they arrive and this back-up strategy should be considered the day in advance. For guests deliberately arriving late, it should be seen as that guest's choice, not your fault as manager, so your duty is first to the guests that are already present and to ensure they're looked after. In a nutshell, act as if there is no problem and carry on regardless. This one is rare if you have planned things carefully, however accidents do happen (such as a guest or young child making a mess of a food table, or an accident in the kitchen). Early on you should be aware of the type of guests so you can take into account when and where food is displayed (such as for a buffet) and where such guests are seated.   Any spillage for safety reasons must be cleaned up immediately, even if it means removing a red carpet or desired décor and furniture to be able to do so. If it is impossible to hide a stain without affecting the appearance or the integrity of the item (such as an antique), then removal is wise. If you have a spare, then use that; if not, move the existing furniture or décor subtly so it does not feel missing. A soft rope barrier, curtain or screen is recommended whenever you need to hide the food area (such as a buffet with chafing dishes, or when organising a \"reveal\" of the next course), as certain guests may feel that if food is in the dining area, it is free-for-all, when they want -- which is not always the case. Shuffle the menu. If part of a dish is not possible to include (such as a side dish that was burnt), either exclude it altogether, find an alternative, reduce the portion sizes to stretch foods, but increase portions of other foods to balance. Advise table hosts as required. Unexpected vegetarians, teetotallers, those with food allergies, religious or special diets –– no surprise should ever occur with proper planning –– but guests occasionally do bring along additional family members, partners or close friends without advising you, especially if it's not a strict invitation-only event. This is usually easily resolved. Keep a headcount as guests arrive and when they arrive at the door, ask if there are any food requirements and advise the kitchen and service staff immediately. For large unexpected groups that are not gatecrashers, send a team member to the kitchen to take stock and, if necessary, drive out to collect more supplies. Kitchens typically over-cater to cover for accidents and more often there are more cancellations than unexpected guests. Limited portions can be stretched when you provide additional fillers, such as bread rolls, salad or vegetable portions, ingredients for which can be quickly sourced from local supermarkets. It's wise to remember that many managers have made serious errors in underestimating the intelligence or forgetting the needs and desires of children at events, as they have the same needs and wants as adults - to have a good time and not be bored. Remember that their parents are also often offended if the event does not cater for their children. In practice, it is best to request an RSVP for every child that may come.   Young children (under 10) are best given food or snacks early as many dinner events have the meals start as late as 8pm, which is far later than most children are used to. Food provided should be fun and healthy but as special as the adult menu as parents appreciate special touches for their children - it makes their job easier so they can have fun as guests in their own right. Over 10's usually are fine to be served adult food and portions, even if they don't eat all of it, but offer the children's menu to them (with their parent's permission) if they don't seem keen on the options. It has also been known for young adults 13-18 to often request the same food as youngsters, such as a hamburger and fries as opposed to more formal restaurant food and it has been a frequently used trick to re-brand the children's menu as an \"Alternative Menu\" for this age group of guests. It is very wise to play safe and discuss with key guests about your plans to keep the young and old engaged, well in advance of the date. A discrete area should be provided for mothers with young children for their needs such as toilet/bathroom breaks, breastfeeding (etc.), and a place for very young children to sleep in if they are tired. Ideally this would never happen, but it does –– family or corporate events both. Politics and drama often come out at events that, as an outsider, you would not be always aware of. Prepare yourself.   Ask the client or key guests before the event of the likelihood of such issues, or with selected hosting guests if it is not appropriate to discuss these issues with the key guests, so that way you can ensure that people are seated in places that will not cause issue. Enlist service staff or key-guests to act as unofficial monitors, to keep an eye out for issues and to step in when required. Strictly speaking, your duty is to ensure the event is smoothly run, but only where it is appropriate, and to stay out of issues that are a private concern. Therefore, you should be aware of who within the party are the \"peacemakers\" of the group. As it can be a difficult job to refuse alcohol to an inebriated guest, or to deal with an inebriated guest that inclines towards anger or violence, it is wise to enlist a peacemaker guest and only involve law enforcement when necessary after consulting with the key guests. Even in small events or backyard events when alcohol is often stored in an ice box for guests to serve themselves, it is equally important to be aware. Gatecrashers are difficult. Should it happen, unobtrusively evict them if appropriate - consult your key guests to verify that they're unwelcome. For large scale and rowdy or abusive gatecrashers, your duty is to protect the existing guests where appropriate and to call security or the police if they do not leave after being politely asked to do so by yourself and/or the key guests. Guests often shuffle name cards about at the beginning where they are sitting, so that they end up sitting next to people they want, or at a table they want. It is wise to check with the key guests how far this is permissible according to them. Typically you should have organised table plans in advance and have received approval from the key guests. Should it be that people must be at certain tables, then it is wise to keep people out of the dining room altogether until time. Often the lobby, foyer or bar area serves this purpose and if it is very important due to family issues, it is wise to group people together and move them en masse to the separate tables by each host-guest and service personnel to seat them in their proper order. Sudden, unexpected rain or snow can be common in parts of the world; likewise, a heatwave or a cold front can also can pose a problem. While weather events are not usually an issue if you're indoors, being outside makes things difficult. If bad weather is expected, then consider moving the event location. If the event cannot be relocated or rescheduled, hire a large tent or pavilion (admittedly this can be pricey on short notice). Keeping an eye on weather developments as you go is important; very little can be done to salvage an event affected by weather, so make the best of what you have. Many parts of the world now have insurance policies in the event of severe weather or other problems. If you are in an area which is known for unexpectedly changeable weather, it is recommended to source a quote if there may be a chance the event will have to be re-scheduled as it will at least cover the client the cost of extending hire of equipment, site and service personnel."

      "There are two options for where your broiler might be. In some gas ovens, there will be a drawer below your oven with your broiler inside. In most electric ovens and some gas ovens, there will be a broiling rod at the top of the oven. Take a peek inside your oven and determine the location of your broiler. If your broiler sits inside of a drawer at the bottom of your oven, it may contain a two-tiered broiling pan. If your broiler is in the top of your oven--or if you've misplaced your two-tiered broiling pan--you will need to use something else. A rimmed cookie sheet is a good option. Cover the pan you will use with aluminum foil, and give it a light spritz with non-stick cooking spray.  If you have a two-tiered broiling pan, cover both tiers with foil. Cut slits into foil on the top pan to allow any fat or grease to drain. Do not use glassware. Even reinforced glass--such as Pyrex--can be damaged under such high heat. If your broiler sits inside your oven, you will need to make sure that you have a rack in the best position. In general, you will place an oven rack in the highest possible slot, 2-4 inches (5.08 - 10.16 cm) away from the heat source. However, for some recipes (such as broiling certain vegetables or fruit), you may want the rack a bit farther away. Your broiler is a direct heat source that warms up pretty quickly. Turn on your broiler and allow it to heat up for five minutes before you begin cooking your food. Most broilers will have just an \"on\" or \"off\" option. But some may also have \"high\" or \"low\" settings. In general, keep your broiler set to high and ignore the low setting. If you are using the low setting, you are really just roasting your food, not broiling.",
      "If your recipe calls for it, season your vegetables with spices, oils or dressings. Then place your vegetables on the broiling pan of your choice. Make sure that your broiler has been heating for about five minutes. Set the broiler pan in the oven, directly beneath the broiler element. Now will you need to wait a bit for the veggies to cook. You may want to set a timer for 10 minutes.  If you have a drawer-style broiler, slide it out and place your pan inside. If your have a broiler at the top of your oven, set an oven rack at the highest position and place your pan it. When your timer goes off, you will know that it is time to turn your vegetables. Carefully remove the broiling pan, turn the vegetables over, and return them to the oven. After you return the pan to the oven, you will want to keep a close watch on your vegetables to make sure that they do not burn. Allow them to broil for up to five more minutes, or when they are cooked through.",
      "If your recipe calls for oil and/or spices, place these on your meat now. Be sure to season both sides of the meat. Using oils or herbs and spices is totally optional when using your broiler. Once your meat has been brought to room temperature and seasoned, it is ready to go in the oven. Set the meat on the broiler pan of your choice, and place the pan in the oven directly beneath the broiler.  If your broiler is in a drawer, slide the drawer out and place your broiler pan inside. If your broiler is in the top of your oven, place your pan on an oven rack in the highest position. For thin to medium-sized cuts of meat, you will want to wait 7-10 minutes before flipping the meat. If you are using thicker cuts (or if you prefer your meat very well done) wait closer to 15 minutes, then flip. After your meat has been flipped, place it back under the broiler and close the door. Wait an additional 5-10 minutes for the meat to finish cooking. The safest and most accurate way to determine the doneness of your meat is to check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer. When your meat reaches the appropriate temperature, remove it from the broiler.  Here are some guidelines:  Medium rare meat = 145 degrees F (63 C) Medium = 160 degrees F (71 C) Well-done meat = 170 degrees F (77 C)"

      "Use tin snips or shop scissors to make a smooth horizontal cut about 1/3 of the way up from its base and around the can’s circumference. Fold the rim on each piece of the can in on itself to eliminate its sharp edges. Take care not to cut yourself as you do so. Most soda cans have a circular base that curves into the interior of the can. Push this out by flattening it with your fingers or using the bottom of a small glass or jar to smooth it. You can use a paper punch for this, or you can make the holes with a nail and hammer. You will need a hole slightly larger than 1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) in diameter. Crumple foil and place it under and around the candle to hold it in place. Tea light candles come in small tins, so the wax should not melt and spill into your aluminum can. The 1⁄8 inch (3.2 mm) tubing should bend easily around the pencil. You will need enough coiled tubing to stretch across the top of the can, plus about an extra 2 inches (5.1 cm) of straight tubing on each side. Center the coil over the wick of the candle. Try to have about the same length of straight tubing sticking out of each side of the can. Bend the straight sections of the tubing so that they go in opposite directions on each side of the can. Then, bend them again so that they reach below the base of the can. When you're done, you should have a coiled section of tubing in the middle over your candle that stretches downward into two opposite-facing \"jets\" on either side of the can. Your \"boat\" should float comfortably. If the tubing ends don't quite sit below the waterline, try weighing the can down slightly, but be careful not to sink it. The easiest way to do this is to place one end in the bowl of water and suck through the other like a straw. Alternately, you can hold your finger over one end and hold the open end under a running faucet. Over time, the water in the tubing will heat up and begin to boil. As it evaporates into steam, it will shoot out of the \"jets\" of the tubing, causing the entire can to spin in the bowl.",
      "Mark a 6 in × 2 in (15.2 cm × 5.1 cm) rectangle horizontally on the side of the can 1 inch (2.5 cm) up from the base. Note that for this paint can (and the other one you'll use), you'll want to ensure that the can contained only latex-based paint and that it has been thoroughly washed with soap and water before use. Bend 2 1⁄3 inches (5.9 cm) at either end of the 4 2⁄3 inches (12 cm) side down at a 90-degree angle. This should create a 4 2⁄3 in × 4 2⁄3 in (12 cm × 12 cm) square \"platform\" with 2 2 1⁄3 in (5.9 cm) \"legs\". Place this mesh inside the paint can, \"legs\" down, lining it up with the edges of the hole you cut. Eventually, you'll burn coals inside this paint can to provide the heat for your steam engine. If these coals don't have a steady supply of oxygen, they won't be able to burn well. Allow ventilation by drilling or punching a series of holes in a half-circle pattern along the edge of the can's lid. These ventilation holes should ideally be about 2⁄5 inch (1.0 cm) in diameter. Take about 20 feet (6.1 m) of soft copper tubing 1⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) in diameter and measure 1 foot (30 cm) from one end. Starting from this point, wrap the tubing into five coils 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter. Wind the remaining length of the tubing into about 15 coils 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter. You should be left with about 8 inches (20 cm) extra. Bend both ends of the coil so that they're pointing upwards and insert each through one of the holes in the lid. If you don't quite have enough length in the tubing, you may need to unwind one of the coils slightly. Place the coil on top of the mesh platform. Fill the space around and inside the coil with charcoal briquettes. Close the lid tightly. In the center of the paint can's lid, drill a hole 2⁄5 inch (1.0 cm) in diameter. On the side of the can, drill two 2⁄5 inch (1.0 cm) holes - one near the base and one above it near the lid. Use the ends of the copper tubing to bore holes in the center of two corks. Insert one 10 inches (25 cm) piece of hard plastic tubing into one cork and one 4 inches (10 cm) piece into the other so that they fit snugly and extend slightly from the other end of the cork. Insert the cork with the longer tubing into the bottom hole on the small can and the cork with the shorter tubing into the top hole. Secure the tubing in each cork with hose clamps. Place the smaller can above the larger can with the corked tubing facing away from the larger can's ventilation holes. Use metallic tape to secure the tubing from the bottom cork to the tubing extending from the bottom of the copper coil. Then, secure the tubing from the upper cork to the tubing extending from the top of the coil in the same way. Use a hammer and screwdriver to remove the center portion of a circular metallic electrical junction box. Secure an electrical cable clamp to the junction box with the retaining ring inside. Insert 1 6 inches (15 cm) copper pipe with a diameter of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) through the cable clamp connector so that the tubing protrudes a few centimeters below the hole in the junction box. Blunt the edges of this end inward with a hammer. Insert this end of the pipe into the hole in the lid of the smaller can. Take a standard wooden barbecue skewer and insert it into one end of a 3⁄5 inch (1.5 cm) hollow wooden dowel rod 3⁄8 inch (0.95 cm) in diameter. Place the dowel rod and skewer inside the copper pipe in the metal junction box so that the skewer points up. The skewer and dowel rod will act as the \"piston\" when the engine is running. To make the motion of the piston easier to see, you might want to attach a small paper \"flag\" to the top. Remove the junction box assembly from the small upper can and fill the upper can with water, allowing it to drain into the copper coil until the can is about 2/3 full of water. Check all connectors for leaks and ensure all seals are tight. Secure the lids of both cans by tapping them with a hammer. Replace the junction box in its spot above the small upper can. Crumple up pieces of newspaper and place them in the space enclosed by mesh at the bottom of the engine. When the charcoal has caught fire, allow the briquettes to burn for about 20-30 minutes. As they heat the water in the coil, steam should begin to build up in the upper can. When this steam reaches sufficient pressure, it will push the dowel and skewer piston upwards. Once sufficient pressure has been released, the piston will be pulled back down by gravity. Trim pieces off of the skewer as needed to reduce the weight of the piston - the lighter it is, the more frequently it will \"pop\" up. Try to whittle the skewer down to a weight such that the piston \"runs\" at a constant clip. You can speed up the burning process by using a hair dryer to blow through the ventilation holes. It probably goes without saying that this DIY steam engine requires careful handling and operation. Never run the steam engine indoors. Never run it around flammable material like dry leaves or overhanging trees. Only run it on a tough, non-flammable surface like concrete. If you're working with children, ensure an adult is present to supervise at all times. Do not children or teenagers approach the engine while the charcoal is burning. If you're ever not sure how hot the engine is, assume that it's too hot to touch. Also, be sure that the steam is able to escape from the upper \"boiler\". If the piston becomes stuck for some reason, pressure can build up inside the small can. In a worst case scenario, this can cause the can to explode, which can be very dangerous."

      "This password is just four or five words in a row, such as \"talkdeathplaidhonest .\" An old idea popularized by an XKCD comic, this system creates passwords that are easy to remember and quite secure. The catch is, you must choose the words at random, for example by using a random word generator or flipping through a book. People who choose the words themselves are much more likely to pick certain types of words, which makes the password much easier for a hacker to guess. Create a unique sentence that you find easy to memorize, then use the first letter of each word as a password. Preserve the capitalization and punctuation. A familiar fact or a story from your life is easy to memorize, but avoid simple statements that someone who knows you could guess. A lie about your life is even better, if you can remember it.  If you're required to include numbers, replace \"to\" with \"2\" and \"for\" with \"4,\" or come up with a sentence that includes a number. For example, the sentence \"It was no fun breaking my tooth when I was 12.\" becomes \"IwnfbmtwIw12.\" Do not use famous quotes or song lyrics, as some hackers test for this system using a quote database. No one wants to  memorize dozens of unrelated passwords, but reusing the same one is even worse. One compromise is to start with one \"base password,\" then adjust it with a rule based on account-specific info such as login name or site name. This is not secure if someone is targeting you personally, but it's an easy way to memorize passwords that should survive mass cracking attempts (when hackers are targeting the service's database).  For example, let's say your base password is RoM4,5zi,. (You can start with something easier to memorize, but that can make your \"rule\" more obvious if one password is compromised.) Let's say your rule is \"Add the second, fifth, and sixth letters of your login name to the front of your base.\" On website 1, your login name is \"MechaBob.\" The 2nd, 5th, and 6th letters are eaB, so your password for this site is \"eaBRoM4,5zi.\" On website 2, your login name is \"RobertMarshall,\" Your password here is \"ortRoM4,5zi.\" If you must write your passwords down, keep them in a secret, private location away from your computer. Instead of just writing down your full login info — a disaster if someone finds the notebook — try one of these systems to make them more secure:  Keep one notebook with a numbered list of your accounts, e.g. \"1. Work Email, 2. Auction Site.\" Keep a second notebook in a different room with a numbered list of passwords. Write the passwords down in code, such as an alphabet cipher, shifted one key left on the keyboard, or anything else you can come up with. This could delay a thief long enough for you to change your passwords, at least. Instead of writing down passwords, write down hints for yourself. After installing a password manager, the software creates and remembers secure passwords for each of your accounts. All you need to do is choose one secure password for the manager — and since this protects everything, this had better be 16 characters long and completely un-guessable. This is much more secure than using the same weak password for every site, but you are creating one point of failure.  Services that store your master password in the cloud are more vulnerable to attack.  The \"remember your password\" feature that came with your browser or computer is not a secure password manager. Unfortunately, the easiest passwords to memorize are also the easiest to guess. Do not rely on these common techniques:  Never use a famous date in your life, the name or initials of yourself or a relative, or other obvious personal details. Even a hacker who doesn't know you may test passwords that follow these common formats. Avoid obvious patterns. \"Orange Yellow Green Red\" is much easier to guess than \"Orange Capture History Dress.\" Numerical series like \"4567\" are the worst of all. Obvious substitutions such as 1 for i or $ for S do not increase security, and make your password harder to remember. The only reason to do this is for accounts that require numbers or symbols in the password.",

      "Unfortunately you can’t play the game if you don’t have the deck of cards. Phase 10 is made and distributed by Mattel Games, the maker of Uno. You can find the card game online at their website . If you don’t want to order online try checking your local game store. You need between two and six people to play Phase 10. It isn’t a single player game so you will need some friends who want to play with you to join in. You will want a big table with seats for everyone. The game can get pretty spread out and you are dealing a whole deck so make sure everyone has enough room. If you don’t have a suitable table you can always play on the floor.",
      "This should include reference cards describing the 10 phases as well as 108 additional cards--24 red, 24 orange, 24 yellow, 24 green (all numbered), 4 skip cards, and 8 wild cards. Each player should receive 10 cards, which are held so that only the player holding the hand can see which cards they are. This will serve as the draw pile. Turn over the top card of this pile and set it face-up next to the draw pile. This will serve as the discard pile. This player will take the top card of either the draw pile or the discard pile, then choose one of their cards to discard. During the first round, each player is trying complete phase 1 (see above) so they can go out and end the round. The round ends and all players score and discard their current hands . Anyone who completed phase 1 in round 1 moves on to trying to complete phase 2, but anyone who could not complete phase 1 needs to do so before proceeding. It is still possible for anyone to win, however; it all depends on who goes out and who ends up with a lot of cards. This person is typically considered the winner, although some people play so that the person with the fewest points wins, no matter who ends the game.",
      "This is a great way to get more than six people playing at one time. This method will also keep the groups changing each hand, allowing everyone to play together while also participating in separate games. For example you could do two groups of four, or a group of five with a group of six, or three groups of five, or anything else you choose. Do this at random so as not to be unfair. Demote the players with the highest scores and those who are working on the lowest phases. Hopefully you don't hurt any feelings, but those are the rules of the game! These could be things like talking in general, talking to specific people, laughing, coughing, scratching, or anything else you come up with. For example, maybe you make a rule that the highest player is not allowed to talk to the lowest player. If they do speak to one another, you can apply a penalty to the players.",
      "These are necessary to learn before you get started playing. You don’t have to memorize them all immediately, just keep this sheep handy so that you can refer to it as the game goes on. As you continue playing the terms will start to stick in your memory.  A set is 2 or more cards of the same number A run is 4 or more cards numbered consecutively (e.g. a 1 card, a 2 card, a 3 card, and a 4 card) A wild card can be used to complete a phase when a player is missing one of the necessary cards A skip card allows the player who uses it to choose another player to lose their turn  Hitting lets players discard cards they don't want, so long as they play them immediately after a phase has been laid down; an example of this would be adding red cards to an initial play of 7 red cards (which is phase 8 of the game). However, players are only allowed to participate in hitting if they've already played their own phase for that round, and only when it's their turn.  Going out describes the action of a player getting rid of their whole hand in a round, either by hitting or by using all their cards in their phase. As soon as any player goes out, the round ends and all players discard their cards to be shuffled and dealt for a new round. The winner of the round is the first one to go out, or use up all their cards. The winner of each round scores a 0. Scoring is one of the most important parts of Phase 10, since the player with the lowest score at the end of the 10 rounds is the winner. Scoring is calculated at the end of each round. The rest of the players gain points for the cards still in their hands.   Cards numbered 1 through 9 are worth 5 points Cards numbered 10 through 12 are worth 10 points Skip cards are worth 15 points Wild cards are worth 25 points There are at least 10 rounds in Phase 10 and, consequently, 10 phases of play.

      "Before you polish your floor, it has to be thoroughly cleaned. Vacuum and wash your floor as you normally would, using the basic cleaning method. Make sure that the floor is completely dry before proceeding to add polish. Be sure to rinse the floor thoroughly after washing. Any leftover cleaning residue could negatively affect the polish. Do not pour the polish directly on the floor. Instead, use a clean bucket to contain the polish. Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instruction on the back of the polish to know how much you should be using. Apply linoleum polish to the floor, using a clean, damp mop. Apply 1-3 coats of polish in approximately 3-4 square foot areas. Allow each coat to thoroughly dry by wait approximately 30 minutes in between coats. Let the final coat of polish dry for approximately an hour before moving back furniture and walking on the floor surface. Try to restrict the number of times you drag your mop over a given area. Moving your mop over an area more than once or twice runs the risk of leaving streaks in the polish.",
      "Sweep, dust mop or vacuum your linoleum floor to remove excess dirt on the floor’s surface. Focus on collecting dirt from areas underneath cabinets, cupboards, and appliances. If you vacuum your linoleum floor, be sure to change the vacuum settings to clean hard surfaces rather than carpet. Fill up a large bucket about ¼ - ½ of the way with lukewarm water. Mix in equal parts of white vinegar. The exact measurements on the water to vinegar ratios are rather loose, because most linoleum floors do not need an entire bucket’s worth of cleaning solution to clean the floor surface. Besides, standing water can damage linoleum, so you never want to use more water than necessary. Use a cleaning product specifically intended for cleaning linoleum floors. Linoleum-specific cleaning products can be found in most flooring and home department stores. Most linoleum floor cleaners need to be diluted with water, so follow the manufacturer’s instructions by mixing in the appropriate amount of cleaning detergent in a large bucket filled with the correct measurements of water. If using a chemical cleaner, make sure that your cleaning area is well ventilated.  Alternatively, you could mix about 6-7 drops of a mild detergent (such as dish soap) with approximately one gallon of warm water as your cleaning solution.  Bear in mind that this solution will clean and disinfect your floors, but a linoleum-specific cleaner might remove dirt a little better. Chemicals that have high pH levels can be extremely damaging to linoleum flooring, so stay away from cleaning products like ammonia when cleaning your linoleum floors. Dip a mop into your cleaning solution, and thoroughly wring out excess solution. Your mop should be damp, rather than dripping wet. Mop the floor in sections, working in about 4-6 square foot areas for each dip of the mop.  If you want to clean you floors more thoroughly, you can use a soft bristled scrub brush instead of a mop. This method would most likely require you to work on your hands and knees. If you are cleaning your floor with a vinegar and water solution, you don’t need to rinse off your floor. Vinegar is a natural disinfectant, and the vinegar and water will evaporate along with the vinegar smell. After you have mopped the whole floor, dump out the bucket of cleaning solution and water, and thoroughly rinse out the mop with clean water. Refill the bucket of water with cool, clean water. Dip the clean mop into the clean water, wring out any excess water, and rinse the cleaning solution from the floor. Again, work in areas approximately 4-6 square foot areas for each time you dip the mop into the water. When you are finished rinsing the floor, dump out the bucket of water. If chemical cleaning solutions are not rinsed from the floor, they will attract tiny particles of dust and dirt, that will be harder to remove later. Wipe down the entire floor with a towel, cleaning cloth, or a terry cloth covered mop head. Allow the floor to completely dry being moving back furniture or allow traffic on the floor surface."

Write what you enjoy writing. If you write about something that you enjoy, your audience will see that, and you'll have a better chance of people liking your writings. Make your writing engaging to the readers. Be sure to know that what you write is real, begin with a statistic that shocks, and make revisions and edits to your writing. Doing these things will grab the reader's attention. Try asking other people for advice on how you can improve your writings. Doing this will help you become a better writer. Post one saying that you're new like \"Hi, Quotev users! I am (your name) and I love to write! Check out my story!\" Doing this will especially place your story down on the lower list because everyone does them. If you want to become a popular writer come up with something original. Avoid cliches like \"I'm pregnant.\" or \"I cheated on you.\" Or even \"They kidnapped me and beat me, but I'm in love with them.\" Everyone hates reading stories like that because they have been done so many times. It just gets boring actually, so come up with a story about your personality and make it original. Honestly though, Quotev thrives off clichéd stories. You can be original, or you could churn out the same storyline every twelve year old on the site's been using. Sadly the latter will earn more fans, so it really lies in what your priorities are - do you want readers, or to write stories you care about while running the risk of them going unnoticed? Sharing your writings outside of Quotev is a good way to attract more readers, and thus will boost your popularity as a Quotev author.  Provide a link to your writings so others can read them. Keep updating even if you don't have many readers. Make posts frequently and reply to comments swiftly. Thank your readers often. You definitely shouldn't let your readers control your schedule. Your writing should be a fun hobby, not another assignment. Remind them firmly that you do, in fact, have a life outside of working for them. You can't just disappear for three weeks when you have left a cliffhanger. This is not to say that you can't disappear. Your readers get that you have a personal life.

      "Now that you’ve located a few therapists, it’s time to contact and interview them. You can do this through an initial consultation, but it might be better and more cost effective to vet your therapist through a very short phone call in which you ask a few questions.  Ask them if they have any LGBT friends or family. Ask them if they are up to date on the latest scholarly work in their field on LGBT issues. Ask them if they've worked with other LGBT people. Ask them if they are comfortable talking about LGBT issues and if their personal or religious feelings might get in the way. Above all, ask them to be as open an honest with you, as you will be with them. After you’ve interviewed your therapist, you need to schedule an appointment in order to have more time to evaluate them and your comfort level with them. If you don’t feel comfortable, and the therapist did not address all of your concerns and seem sympathetic, then you should go else where. After your initial visit, consider the following:  Did this person seem at ease with you? Did they talk openly about your sexuality or gender identity? Did you feel comfortable? Your therapist should not reinforce negative messages prevalent in society about LGBT people. They should suggest positive coping strategies to deal with the discrimination you experience. Positive coping strategies can include:  Setting boundaries with harmful people in your life. Joining an LGBT group. Finding volunteer work in the community. Now that you’ve researched, interviewed, and chosen your therapist and decided you are comfortable with that person, you should commit to a course of therapy. Working through your issues, whatever they might be, will probably not be a quick or easy process. Therapy is often an ongoing process and it might take months or even years to begin to work through your problems. As long as you are in a positive and affirming relationship with your therapist and you feel it is helping you heal and grow, you should stick with the process!",
      "There have been many positive changes since the days when not being heterosexual was viewed as a disease. However, other areas like gender identity are unfortunately sometimes still viewed through a pathological lens. Some of the main points to remember are:  Being LGBT is not an illness, and those who say it is are in disagreement with the findings of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Medical Association. No science has backed up theories that being LGBT results from having parent problems during childhood. Therapists who still advocate that view are not only on dubious scientific footing, but are reinforcing the negative messages about being LGBT. Attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity are ineffective and harmful. Being LGBT in and of itself has not been found to be a source of mental illness or to result in rates of mental illness higher than the general population. Instead, stresses an individual faces from homophobia cause a great deal of mental anguish for LGBT people. Therapies that ignore this can increase rates of suicide, anxiety, and depression in the those being treated. Counselors who advertise as working within a certain religious structure are outwardly advertising that they will be using this as their value scaffolding in their therapy. This is not to say you cannot find a therapist who is both religious and LBGT-affirming, nor is it to say you can't be of a certain religion and also be LGBT. Talk to a potential therapist about their beliefs and values, and whether or not they have a moral stance on LBGT issues. If they are not supportive, then this is not the counselor for you. Do not allow anyone to try to change you to conform to their own religious morality. There are many therapists, religious and non-religious, who specialize in making you “normal” and turning you heterosexual. Be aware of their tactics and their terminologies so you can identify them. If your therapist does use any of these tactics or terminologies, you should probably go elsewhere. To help identify gay-conversion therapists, consider these questions:  Does the therapist insist you're a \"confused heterosexual\" and not respect your gender or sexual identity? Does the therapist spend a lot of time talking about how your parents treated you when you were very young? Does the therapist ignore your mental health concerns and insist you engage in gender “appropriate” activities? Does the therapist reject the idea that it's okay to be LGBT? When looking for a therapist, you need to be aware that not all therapists will be open and sympathetic to LGBT issues. If they are not sympathetic, your experience will probably not be a positive healing experience. There are a number of things you should consider and be aware of when you choose a therapist:  It's not safe to automatically assume potential therapists will be knowledgeable or sympathetic to LGBT issues. There are still many therapists and psychiatrists who may view LGBT people as inherently mentally ill, or troublesome, or in need of a \"cure\" for their identity. Therapists might not openly lead with their biases, but if you ask them directly you should be able to get a sense of where they stand on LGBT issues or the issues closest to your needs. You might also want to ask a potential therapist whether or not they themselves are comfortable sharing what their orientation is, and whether or not they are out of the closet. Some therapists will adhere to a professional standard of never disclosing their own orientation to their clients, and you may have to decide whether you would be okay with this.",
      "Make sure to specifically seek out therapists that list themselves as \"LGBT-affirming.\" After all, you want  a therapist who will affirm your LGBT identity and help you reach a better place mentally while being who you are.  Consider referrals from friends in your community. Look at the Yellow Pages. See if there is a LGBT community center or support groups that might point you in the right direction. There are many places on the internet to find a list of mental health professionals that can help you, including professional association websites, forums, support group websites and more. Consider the following:  Search for mental health professionals at https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms  Use the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association’s Provider Directory athttp://www.glma.org/ to look through a list of inclusive medical providers. Check out the Healthcare Equality Index at http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/healthcare-equality-index to find the LGBT inclusive policies of organization leaders in healthcare. If you are transgender, consider the following resource at http://www.drbecky.com/therapists.html. LGBT sympathetic therapists are not available everywhere. However, distance therapy is a possible way to get the therapy you desire. Some therapists offer different forms of distance therapy in an effort to reach a wider range of people in various locations and across distances. Phone therapy and online therapy are effective means to engage a LGBT-affirming therapist from outside of your community. Don’t limit yourself to just “therapists.” There are a wide range of mental health, and social welfare professionals who might be able to provide the guidance and support you need. Consider the following:  Licensed Clinical Social Workers: These social workers have clinical experience. You'll often find them working in group settings. Licensed Addiction Counselors: Addiction counselors are not therapists, but work in a similar capacity. Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists: These therapists specialize in family and marriage issues."

      "AirDrop does not transfer over your standard wireless network, so you'll need to ensure that the two devices are physically close to each other. For optimal performance, both devices should be within 30 feet (10 meters) of each other. AirDrop allows for file transfers between iOS devices and OS X computers, but you'll need to meet some basic requirements in order to use it. AirDrop requires:  iOS Devices - iPhone 5 or later, iPad mini, iPad 4th Generation or later, or iPod Touch 5th Generation or later. Must be running iOS 7 or later, iOS 8 if you intend to use AirDrop between your iPhone and Mac. Mac Computers - OS X Yosemite (10.10) or later for transferring between iOS and OS X. MacBooks from mid-2012 or newer and iMacs from late 2012 should work. If your AirDrop visibility is turned off, other devices won't be able to find you.  iOS - Open the Control Center and tap the AirDrop button. Select \"Everyone\" for maximum compatibility. You'll still need to confirm transfers, so this isn't really a security issue. OS X - Open a Finder window and select the AirDrop option in the left menu. Set \"Allow me to be discovered by\" to \"Everyone.\" You'll have to manually confirm transfers, so this isn't a security risk. Leave the AirDrop window open while attempting to connect. A common fix for connection problems is toggling your device's Bluetooth adapter off and on again.  iOS - You can quickly do this by swiping up from the bottom of your screen to open the Control Center and then tapping the Bluetooth button. OS X - Click the Bluetooth menu button and turn Bluetooth off and then back on. AirDrop uses a combination of these two connections to setup an AirDrop connection. Check the Control Center on your iOS device and the menu bar on your OS X computer to ensure that both of these services are turned on. AirDrop has always been a bit buggy, and sometimes software updates will fix the issue you're having. Updates for iOS and OS X are free, but they may take a little while to complete.  iOS - Open the Settings app and select \"General\". Tap \"Software Update\" and then follow the prompts to install any available updates. This will usually take about 30 minutes. See How to Upgrade iOS for detailed instructions. OS X - Click the Apple menu and select \"App Store\". Find the latest OS X release, which is usually on the front page of the store. Download the update, which may be rather large, and then follow the prompts to install it. See How to Update to Mac OS X Mavericks for instructions on updating OS X. If you're having difficulties connecting to your Mac computer, try signing out of iCloud on the Mac and then signing back in. Click the Apple menu and select \"System Preferences\".

      "There are many different classifieds websites and apps out there that you can sell your furniture on. The more popular the site is, the more exposure your listing will get. Opt for sites that you’ve heard about to give your furniture the best chance to sell. Letgo and Etsy are examples of popular sites that people use to buy and sell items. Many sites will charge you a fee for each of your listings, while others take a percentage of each of your sales. In order to pocket as much money as you can, avoid these sites and instead opt for ones that allow you to list for free. Craigslist and Facebook are a couple of the most popular sites that allow you to list for free. However, there are also many less popular options, including:  FreeAdsTime Oodle OLX.com Because it has become more popular to buy and sell items online, there are now not only sites where all kinds of items are for sale, but also sites where only specific items are for sale. Consider going with a site made specifically for furniture sales to get the best luck, as potential buyers visiting these sites are usually looking to buy furniture. Some of these sites include Move Loot and Viyet. Often, buyers will trust you more if you include a picture and a provide some information about yourself. Plus, many sites have review systems, where you can leave reviews for buyers and buyers can leave reviews for you.",
      "The way to create new listings varies based on which site you’re using. However, most sites have an easily accessible button that you can click on in order to be redirected to a page where you can enter in a new product description and photos. Click on any button you see that says something like “New Post” or “Create a Listing.” On Letgo, this button reads, “Sell My Stuff.” include all the basic information about the furniture in the description, such as how big it is and what material it's made out of. The buyer wants to know as much information about the piece as you can provide. For example, if you’re selling a kitchen table, your description might say something like, “Used sturdy 44 in (110 cm) by 44 in (110 cm) by 36 in (91 cm) kitchen table for sale. The table is made of oak and comes with 4 chairs and blue detachable seat cushions. Both the table and chairs are in excellent condition, and have no scratches.” You don't want angry buyers who will leave you with a bad review or refuse to pay. Even if your furniture isn't in perfect condition, there's likely still a buyer out there who may want it. Try to be as honest and straightforward as you can to keep potential buyers happy and to encourage them to follow through with the sale. Try to answer as many questions as you can ahead of time. Put yourself in the buyer's shoes. What would you want to know about the piece of furniture? For instance, is it easy to clean? Is your home pet-, bug-, and smoke-free? How long have you had the piece? Buyers will be curious about the answers to these questions. The ad is your opportunity to really sell this piece of furniture. Highlight its best features, such as how comfortable it is, the color, or its great wood details, in the listing description. If it has a story (such as it was handmade), play up that detail. Think about what attracted you to the piece in the first place, and be sure to include that in your description as well. For example, if you’re selling a large L-shaped couch, you might write. “This couch’s soft fabric and supportive structure make it perfect for comfy movie nights with the whole family.” After you’ve finished writing your description, complete with details and stories, read over it slowly and carefully. Errors can drive away potential buyers because they may make you look careless, or make your description unclear. Carefully proofread your listing to make it as professional as possible. People want to see your furniture, not the mess that surrounds it. Clean up the area around the furniture before you take photos of it. It’s also a good idea to also take any extras, such as throw pillows, table runners, or vases, off of the furniture so that potential buyers can see every part of it. No one wants to see the stains on your old table or microfiber couch. Scrub it down before you take a photo so that your furniture looks as good as it possibly can. For fabric furniture, you may want to vacuum it and spot-treat it, for instance. Buyers are more likely to click on an ad with quality photos, so make sure that you take a few in good lighting that are clear. Also, taking photos at multiple angles can help potential buys get a better idea of what the product truly looks like. Then, upload them to your listing.  Keep in mind that some sites may limit how many photos you can upload, so you may have to pick your best shots. The best lighting is natural light, so try to take pictures during the day in a room with a lot of sunlight. Skip the stock photos. You may be able to find stock photos of your furniture online. However, people want to see the actual furniture you have in your home, not a brand-new model. People are typically more drawn to reasonable prices; too high might make potential buyers feel like they’re being ripped off and too low can make them doubt the validity of the description and photos. Go online and look up pieces that are similar to your piece before deciding on a price for yours. You can also put information like the age, brand, and condition of your piece into an online furniture calculator to find out what it’s most likely worth. After seeing what others are selling similar pieces for online, take a good look at your furniture piece and determine what condition it's in, whether it’s like new, has a few small scratches here and there, or is very worn. While condition tends to be most important, age is also a big factor. Generally, the older your furniture is, the less it will go for. Choose a price that you think is the most fair, clearly state the price in your listing, and then post the listing.  It’s best to price the piece at 20-50% of the original price. Pick a price that’s a little lower than market price if it’s in excellent condition and you bought it less than a year ago. Pick a price that’s significantly lower than market price if its worn and a few years old.",
      "After you've uploaded your ad and submitted to the site, questions are likely to come in from potential buyers. Answer each one as promptly and as honestly as you can. If, for example, a potential buyer messages you and asks “Has the fabric of the couch faded at all?” you might respond by saying, “Hello! There’s very minimal fading towards the center of each seat cushion, but nowhere else on the rest of the couch. Let me know if you have any other questions, and I’ll be happy to answer them for you.” Many buyers will expect to haggle with you. You can lower the price or stand firm on it as you see fit. Keep in mind, you may sell faster if you are willing to come down a bit on the price. Once you've completed all of your steps, you've hopefully found a buyer. You can complete the transaction if you both agree on the price. For safety's sake, make sure to always have a friend around when a buyer arrives. Potential buyers are more likely to be interested in your furniture piece and follow through with the sale if you offer a delivery option. Even if you aren’t able to offer delivery, it’s a good idea to let interested buyers know right away that the piece is pickup only, so that they don’t realize this later on and back out of the sale.  Don’t forget to charge a little extra for a delivery service. This is understandable and typically expected, as you’ll be taking your time and using your gas in order to deliver the piece. Additionally, double check the agreed upon time and place if you’re meeting the buyer somewhere to give them the piece."

      "Keep in mind the number of fish you want to breed, each fish’s coloring, and the shape of their tails. If you choose two fish to breed who have the same color patterns, the fry will also have that color pattern. The same principle applies for fin shape.  Number of fish: Generally, you will want to select one male and two or three female guppies for breeding. When there is a ratio of one to one, the male often becomes aggressive, chasing the female around the tank. With a one to three ratio, the male’s attention is split between three females, making breeding a less stressful process for the females.  Color pattern: There are several basic guppy patterns. These include Wild (grey or olive coloring), Albino (light colors or white with red eyes,) Blonde (light colors with black pigment,) and Blue (shimmering blue color.) Tail shape: The shape of guppy tails can range from a rounded back fin to a sword-like shape. There are many different shapes and sizes that guppy tails come in, but the most common are the Delta (which is a large triangular shape,) the Fantail (which is shaped like a fan,) and the Round tail (which is a small, round shape.) You should select a 10 to 20 gallon tank with a heater and a gentle filter. You want the filter to be gentle because otherwise the baby guppies (which are called fry) could be sucked up the filter and killed. If you think your filter is too strong, cover the opening of the filter with sheer tights. The tights will allow the water to be filtered but will also protect the fry. Sadly, guppy parents can turn rather cannibalistic so you will need to provide the fry with hiding places for after they are born. Guppy fry tend to sink, so use low-floating plants for their cover. Some high cover is also required as healthy fry will swim upwards.  Do not use any substrate. Substrate are the rocks/imitation rocks used to cover the bottoms of fish tanks. A bare bottom tank is good for fry as it cleans easily and you can record how many fry are alive or how much they eat. Java moss or spawning moss provides a nice hiding spot for guppy fry. Set the temperature to around 77-79 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 26.11 C) while the females and male are in the tank together. Before you place the guppies in the breeding tank, purchase  food with a higher nutritional value in order to promote healthy breeding. At this point, all you can do is wait for your fish to breed. Place the male back in the regular tank when you notice that your female(s) are pregnant. You can tell whether a female fish is pregnant or not by looking to see if there is a dark mark on her abdomen. This mark is called a gravid spot. All female fish will develop this when pregnant, but it becomes noticeably darker when the eggs have been fertilized. Generally, the gestation period will take 26 to 31 days. When your female guppy is ready to give birth, her stomach will be very large and her gravid spot will be a deep black (or dark maroon if you are breeding albino or blond guppies.) Her stomach will also square off like a cardboard box rather than growing rounder. Be prepared for the fact that guppies give birth to live babies and not eggs. You will have to monitor your pregnant female closely so that you are there when she gives birth so that you can remove her from the tank immediately after (she may eat her babies otherwise.) Some signs of a fish going into labor are: being very still and secluding herself, shivering (contractions), hanging out near the heater, or a change in appetite (including refusing to eat, or spitting her food out.)",
      "While this may seem like a cruel practice, guppy fry are actually born fully prepared to survive on their own. Also, as stated about, mother guppies can occasionally become cannibalistic and will eat their babies. If you are not able to be there when your female gives birth, make sure to provide the fry lots of aquarium plants to hide in. Fry need to live in a tank that is around 78 degrees F (25.5 degrees C.) Keep your tank at this temperature until the fry are fully grown. The tank will also need to be cleaned often. Siphon the tank carefully every time it gets too dirty and do 40% water changes every few days to keep the water clean. Guppy fry eat brine shrimp, micro-worms or powdered flakes. They should be fed twice a day. Guppies enjoy both meat and vegetables. You should feed your guppies vegetable flakes, as well as standard flakes. Remember that fry are tiny and if you place too much food in the tank, the excess food that goes bad while sitting in the water could make your fry sick, or even kill them. Newborn fry should be fed recently hatched brine shrimp so that the guppies reach their greatest growth potential. If you want to give your guppies a treat, place a small amount of boiled spinach in their tank. This means removing any fry that have died. Dead fry will float to the top of the tank, making it easy to scoop them up. Keep track of how many fry die. If you notice that there is a high amount of fry death, you will want to figure out what is killing them. Change the water and switch to a different type of food. Any accumulated waste is bad for guppy health. When the fry are a good size, or about a month and a half to two months old, they will be ready to fend for themselves outside of the breeding tank. You can put them into your normal tank with non-aggressive fish, sell them to your local pet store, or give them to friends as gifts."

      "As you recover from vaginal thrush, you should focus on keeping your genital area clean and dry. Wash your vagina with water and mild soap or no soap. Pat it dry or air dry it after washing. When wiping yourself after going to the bathroom, use soft white toilet paper and always wipe from front to back. Breathable fabrics like cotton ensure your vagina can breathe and is not irritated due to sweating during the day. When washing your underwear, you should use mild, fragrance-free soap. Avoid using fabric softeners or dryer sheets, as these can contain chemicals that may irritate your vagina. These substances can irritate your vagina and delay the treatment of vaginal thrush. You should also avoid taking bubble baths, using bath oils, talc, or powder. Make sure to avoid powders that contain cornstarch, as cornstarch provides food for microorganisms. Tampons can irritate your vagina and slow down the treatment process, so it's best to avoid them while you recover. Though vaginal thrush cannot be spread through sexual contact, you should still use condoms when having sex to prevent the spread of other diseases or infections.",
      "Though you may be trying to avoid a trip to the doctor, it is important that you at least call your primary care physician before attempting any home treatments. Though there may be much anecdotal evidence behind some of these methods, they have not been proven to work, and they may in fact make matters worse, causing further irritation and/or infections. Yogurt can help to repopulate your vagina with harmless bacteria that can “crowd out” the Candida bacteria, though this is not supported by many scientific studies. Do not insert yogurt into your vagina. This is an old treatment and can be associated with doing more harm than good, as the sugars in the yogurt can lead to more problems, such as other infections. Probiotic capsules can be found in most grocery stores and drugstores. Look for a brand that contains Bifidobacterium longum; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Bifidobacterium infantis; Lactobacillus acidophilus; Lactobacillus reuteri HA-188. Keep in mind it is not medically known if probiotics can help to prevent vaginal thrush. You can use OTC creams and gels for vaginal yeast infections to treat vaginal thrush, as they contain antifungal agents. Look for common brands like Monistat and Gyne-Lotrimin at your local drug store. Use them according to the instructions on the label. If you have recurring infections, use them for seven days. Use a single dose treatment if you have occasional infections. . While douching is generally not recommended for women— and there is no evidence to support it use — it can be used as a home treatment method when you have vaginal thrush. Discuss this with your doctor before attempting. You can douche with the following substances:  Pure apple cider vinegar: Apple cider vinegar can restore the acidic pH of your vagina and is also an antibacterial agent. Douche twice a day for four days and then daily until your vaginal thrush symptoms disappear.  Diluted hydrogen peroxide: Combine 3% hydrogen peroxide with an equal amount of warm distilled water and douche your vagina with this mixture. Make sure you use distilled water, so it will be sterile and bacteria-free. Douche twice a day with this mixture for four days and then daily until your vaginal thrush symptoms disappear.  Essential tea tree oil: Put two to three drops of tea tree oil into eight ounces of distilled water. Douche with this mixture twice a day for one week and then daily until all symptoms of your vaginal thrush disappear. Do not ingest the tea tree oil orally. It is thought by some that inserting a whole clove of peeled garlic into your vagina can treat vaginal thrush. Replace the garlic with a fresh clove every four hours for seven days or until your symptoms go away.  Again, it is important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support this and that inserting something foreign into your vagina may cause more harm than good. You can also consume garlic orally, either on its own, or in cooking.",
      "You should get an official diagnosis for vaginal thrush, even if you plan to use home remedies. Your doctor will examine your genital area and likely perform a speculum exam and collect a sample of any vaginal discharge, which will be examined under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for and ask about the symptoms of thrush, which include:   An abnormal vaginal discharge. The discharge may appear like cottage cheese, with whitish lumps that do not have an odor. Swelling on and around the genital area Soreness, itchiness, or a burning sensation in the genital area Your doctor may also ask you if you feel any pain or discomfort during sex or when you urinate. Your doctor may prescribe oral antifungal drugs, like fluconazole or itraconazole, or antifungal drugs that you apply directly to your vagina, like miconazole or clotrimazole. These antifungal drugs only work exclusively on vaginal thrush. You may experience more intense burning and itching in your genital area during the first few days of treatment but your symptoms should clear up within seven to 14 days. These medications have a “cure rate” of around 80-90%. If you have experienced a vaginal fungal infection before and your doctor confirms that you have vaginal thrush, you can take OTC antifungal drugs, which have a lower concentration of the antifungal agents found in prescription antifungal medications.  Most OTC medications have a one-day to seven-day dose. Take a single dose, as it is usually the most effective for occasional vaginal thrush. If you get repeat infections, take the longer dose medications. Do not take OTC medications if you believe you have any other infection besides vaginal thrush. Some patients experience more burning from the one-day treatment. If this is the case, you should switch to one of the longer treatments. If you experience a lot of irritation or burning on the outside of your vagina, apply A&D ointment liberally to the area (but not inside the vagina) to help relieve symptoms. OTC medications are also recommended if your symptoms are relatively mild, you experience no fever or pelvic pain and you are not pregnant. If you think you may be pregnant or are pregnant and develop vaginal thrush, you should speak to your doctor."

      "When choosing which airport to fly into, it may help knowing that both Charles de Gaulle airport and Orly airport have direct, 45 minute shuttles to the Disneyland Paris park, and Charles de Gaulle has a direct TGV train to the Disneyland Paris park gates. Beauvais-Tille also has a direct shuttle to the park which takes about an hour and a half. There a plethora of options, including direct shuttles from the major airports and the TGV direct train from Charles de Gaulle airport to the park. It is also easy to rent a car, take the train, or take a cab. Once you've landed in Paris, your shuttle provider will provide you with directions to make sure you can find the bus. If you're renting a car, follow signs in the airport to find the appropriate rental car stand to complete your reservation. If you opted to go the train route, there should also be signs to get you to the RER or TGV (only in Charles de Gaulle) stations after you get your bags.",
      "Services like Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, or Mapquest will provide turn-by-turn directions and even guide you around traffic if your co-pilot operates while you drive. The parking lot is located on Boulevard de Parc, 77700 Coupvray, FR (48°52'33.9\"N 2°47'47.3\"E). From the UK, the Eurotunnel Shuttle will take you and your car from Folkestone to Calais. Alternately, there are ferries that run across the English channel, such as the P&O ferry from Dover to Calais. If you're trying to get to France through a different European country, there are a variety of highways on the E-road network that should be able to get you into the country. There are plenty of signs for the park on the Autoroute and E-road highways to guide you. From the north, take the A26 from Calais and change to the A4, following signs for \"Metz/Nancy\" if you don't see signs for the park. From the south, follow the motorway towards \"Paris\" and follow signs for Disneyland Paris.  Some French motorways are toll roads, so be prepared to pay the appropriate toll. Parking is free if you're staying at a Disneyland hotel, but will cost money if you're staying elsewhere.",
      "The RER (Réseau Express Régional) is a network of express trains that run from central Paris to its suburbs. There are 16 metro lines and 5 RER lines that run throughout Paris. If both a metro and RER station are equally close, the RER train will likely be faster as it is an express train.  Search alternate train options; depending on your starting location there may be a faster train. For example, there is a TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse, or high-speed train) direct from the Charles-de-Gaulle Airport to Disneyland Paris.  There are also Eurostar trains to Disneyland Paris direct from several places in the United Kingdom. You can purchase these tickets from any metro or RER station ticket window, or from any of the automated ticket vending machines located around Paris. If you're traveling from central Paris (public transportation Zone 1) this is the only ticket you'll need to purchase.  A one-way ticket from central Paris will cost less than 8 EUR (as of August 2018). A ticket t+ will NOT work for this trip since your final stop is in Zone 5, do not be a cheapskate. A fine of 35 EUR will be given if you have a wrong ticket for the wrong zone. Pass Navigo Decouverte is accepted. Paris Visite Cards and Ticket Mobilis are accepted IF AND ONLY IF Zone 5 is included. Ticket Jeune Weekend is accepted IF AND ONLY IF Zone 5 is included, AND you are under 26 and travel on weekends OR bank holidays. If the closest RER station to you does not serve the A train, you will need to take a different RER or Metro line and switch over to the RER A train. For example, if you're traveling from Charles de Gaulle airport, take the RER B train to Paris and switch to the RER A train line towards Marne la Valleé at Châtelet Les Halles station. The sign for your direction may also read \"Boissy-St-Legér\", in addition to \"Marne-la-Valleé\". As you're waiting for your train, make sure that the stop panels hanging above the train platform have a yellow box next to the Marne-la-Valleé - Chessy station.  If Marne la Valleé - Chessy is not listed on the hanging panels, you're on the wrong side of the platform. Keep your ticket handy while you're aboard the RER in case you need to show it to a ticket checker (known as \"controllers\"). The Marne-la-Valleé/Chessy stop is a two minute walk from the park gates. Exit the RER A train station and go up the escalator, following the signs for \"Sortie\". Use your billet Ile-de-France in the turnstiles as you exit."

      "Rinse each avocado under running water, and make sure that you wash it thoroughly. It doesn't matter whether you grew the avocado yourself or found it laying on the sidewalk, it's important that you rinse any chemicals and bacteria from your produce before you eat it. Dry the avocados with a clean towel afterwards to remove any persistent debris. Use a sharp knife to cut around the avocado lengthwise. Carefully place it on a cutting board, and start slicing at the top of the avocado. Rotate the avocado and knife so you cut around the entire avocado and meet up with the initial slit. Then hold the two halves of the avocado and twist them in opposite directions to open the fruit. Use a sharp, sturdy knife, and place the pit-containing half of the avocado on a cutting board. Thwack the knife solidly into the avocado pit (1/8-1/4 inch deep) so that it won't easily budge. Then, hold the avocado firmly and twist the knife (and attached pit) until the pit dislodges from the fruit. Tap or slide the pit off of the knife into a garbage can or compost bin.  Exercise great caution when using a knife. If you don't want to use a knife, you can remove the put with a spoon. If you use a spoon, try to wedge your tool beneath the seed and separate it from the surrounding meat so that you can scoop out the pit. Now that you have two avocado halves, cut the avocado halves in half again, to make 4 wedges. Then pull the dark outer skin away from the green flesh of the fruit. Peel the fruit by sliding your thumb in between the skin and meat of the fruit, and peel the skin back away from the meat.  If you slice the avocados open and scoop out the meat using a spoon, you don't need to peel the avocado. However, many people favor peeling off the skin of the avocado because it ensures you retain the dark green, high-nutrient layer of avocado meat closest to the outer skin. Consider cutting away the tough area where the stem meets the avocado. If you don't remove it now, you might find it amid your avocado butter later! You can hand-mash the fruit in a bowl, or you can grind it in a food processor. Either way, mash the avocado until there are no large chunks remaining.   If you are hand-mashing the avocado, use a fork or a mortar and pestle. Chop the avocado into chunks first to make it easier to mash. You want the mixture to be smooth like guacamole. If you are using a blender or food processor, put the avocado chunks into the machine, add all of the ingredients, and close the lid. Process until there are no large remaining chunks. This method is best if you're making a large quantity of avocado butter – it will be much easier than hand-mashing.",
      ". Search supermarkets, farmers markets, and local fruit stands. Look for avocados that are firm, unblemished, and uniformly brown. Review these qualities to determine whether an avocado is ripe:   Check the color and appearance: Choose avocados without dark blemishes or deep indentations on the skin. California Hass avocados ripen into a dark green or black shade; if they are green at all, they probably aren't ripe. Florida avocados on the other hand, have lighter-green skin with a yellowish tone, even when they are ripe.   Feel the avocados for ripeness: Gently squeeze the avocado to test its firmness. Don't squeeze very hard with your fingertips, or you'll risk bruising the fruit. A ripe avocado is soft, but it gives in to the pressure of your thumb and other fingers. Under-ripe avocados will be firm and hard; overripe avocados will be mushy to the touch, and often unevenly so.   Check the spot where the stem meets the fruit: Use your fingernail to pick away the circular remainder of the stem. This should reveal a small hole in the skin through which you can note the color of the avocado. If the \"meat\" is green, it's either ripe or ripening. If the inside of the avocado looks brown, black, or any other color, it's either overripe or moldy. Purchase unripe, firm avocados if you plan on using them in a few days. Store unripe avocados in a paper bag at room temperature between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 and 23.88 degrees Celsius) for up to 5 days or until they are ripe. If you want to slow the ripening process, store your avocados in a refrigerator. Only ripe or soft avocados should be refrigerated. Ripe fruit can be refrigerated until it is eaten, and should last for at least two more days. The citric acid adds a tangy flavor, but its primary function is actually to preserve the avocado butter so that it will last longer. The citric acid also prevents the avocado butter from oxidizing and turning brown. If you don't add lemon juice, the avocado butter will begin to go brown within hours of preparation.  If you don't have access to lemons, you can use any concentrated citrus juice: lime, orange, grapefruit, etc. Generally, the more sour the fruit, the more citric acid it contains. You could even use pre-bottled lemon or lime juice. Avoid using citrus juice that has been sweetened, pasteurized, or infused with chemical additives. Only use citrus concentrate. You can also use margarine, a butter substitute, or 1/4 cup olive oil. Lukewarm or room-temperature butter is much softer and more spreadable than cold butter. Because room temperature butter is softer, it's much easier to mix into avocado butter. If you have butter stored in the fridge, move it to room temperature and let it \"thaw\" before you use it. If you don't want to use butter, you can simply mash up the avocado with all of the other ingredients. Your butter-less \"avocado butter\" will not have quite the same texture as its buttery counterpart, but you'll be able to use it in all of the same situations. The crux of the recipe is the avocado, the butter, and the citric acid – so everything else that you add is purely a matter of taste. Try adding one clove of minced garlic, one tablespoon of fresh-chopped cilantro, two teaspoons of cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. Feel free to use fewer seasonings for a simpler avocado butter, or more complex seasonings for a spicier butter. Try various seasoning combinations to figure out what you prefer.",
      "The avocado butter will be freshest if you eat it right after you prepare it. Consider refrigerating it for 1-4 hours (in a covered bowl, or wrapped in parchment paper) before eating, if you'd like it cold. Consider the following ideas for eating avocado butter:   Spread avocado butter on toast. You can spread it thickly onto bread, English muffins, tortillas – anything onto which you'd spread regular butter.  Use avocado butter in a sandwich. You can use a lot of avocado butter as the key ingredient, or you can spread it thinly onto the bread as a condiment. Be aware that the more butter you used to make your avocado butter, the less you may want to eat in one sitting.  Mix avocado butter into a salad. This treat can make a great salad dressing. Serve it on the side, or toss it directly into the mix.  Eat avocado butter with any number of snacks. Dip chips or crackers; spread onto deviled eggs; dip your french fries into it; or eat it straight. You want to store the avocado butter in an air-tight container. To help the avocado keep its green color, you can put a layer of plastic wrap on top of the avocado butter (so it's touching the top surface). Fresh avocado butter should keep for three days in the refrigerator or a week in the freezer. The avocado will begin to brown within a few hours if isn't protected with concentrated lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit juice. Don't add more than a few drops – otherwise, you may impair the taste."

      "Identify a person's name with a fact about him. By doing this, you will be able to recall his name by viewing a mental image of the person and his personality or job. For example, if you meet a client named Tyler who sells printer toner, say to yourself, \"Tyler sells toner.\" Although this sentence may sound simple, it will help you remember his name in the long run. If there isn't a catchy phrase associated with the person's name, create a mental image of him performing an activity that he enjoys. For example, if you meet a man named Dylan who is a fan of baseball, imagine him wearing a baseball cap. When you meet him again, you will have an image to associate with him. By repeating it a few times, you will plant it into your memory. Although you should actively participate in the conversation, focus on recalling his name. When listening to him speak, think, \"Danny told me about his new car.\" Mentally play with the name to help it stick. Over exaggerate the syllables, break it into parts, or associate a bit of it with other words. For example, the name Natalie can be exaggerated to sound like \"Naaat-ahhh-leee.\" Also, it can be made into nonsense words, such as, \"Nat-Tall-Lee,\" \"Nat-bat,\" or \"Lee-key.\" Different combinations will help ingrain her name into your memory. Connect the name of the person with someone in your life, such as a celebrity, a friend, or a family member. You can do this by noting that he has the same hair color, style, etc. Make the connection as close as possible in order to remember why you associated them.  For example, you meet a new classmate. You could connect him with your high school lab partner because they both have the same name and hair color. You could also associate him with a movie character because they both have the same appearance. Note that the connection doesn't have to make sense to anyone but you.  State your connection out loud. For example, once the person introduces himself, you could say, \"My sister just named her son [insert name]!\" You will not only contribute to the conversation but also help you recall his name. Often, people forget names because their attentions are divided. Meeting someone with the intention to remember the name will increase your chances of doing so. Focus your attention on the person to whom you are being introduced to. Consciously think about how you care about the introduction, as well as the goal to remember his name. A mnemonic device is a verbal phrase or visual cue that helps you remember information. Apply this method using the person's name. For example, if you meet a man named Derek who likes to workout, create a phrase such as, \"Dude Enjoys Really Energetic Kickboxing.\" This associates his name with words that describe a fact that you learned about him. You can make the phrases as simple or as hard as you want. As long as they stick in your head, they will help you remember the person's name.",
      "As soon as you meet a new person, jot it down. Also, include other facts about him or her that you recall. List the time and place that you met him or her, as well as actions he completes or interesting information that she mentioned in your conversation. Writing down these facts will help you recall her name, especially since you have a physical reminder. Also, it will also give you a source to refer to if you meet her again.  Large events may not give you the chance to instantly write down names, especially since many introductions may be made. Instead, insert important names into your phone. Later, you can refer to them and add interesting facts that will help you recall them. Another excellent method is to  leave yourself an audio message. You could also create a virtual file. Create a document or table with people's names on it. Add to it each time you meet a new person. Share the file with all your devices in order to always keep a physical reminder with you. Take the person's name, and turn it into a picture in your mind. Associate the name with an object. For example, the name Crystal could be identified with a large crystal vase or bowl. A visual connection can be a powerful tool when recalling names. This also works with names that sound similar to a concept. For example, you have a new man at work named Miles. You can associate him with a picture of a a long road that goes on for miles. When you first meet someone, study her face. Look for a feature that is unique and associate her name with it. For example, you could identify the new employee in your office by her dimples. This method will put her face into your head and help you remember her name. An excellent method to remember a person is to think of an absurd scene in relation to him. For example, if you meet someone who owns a pet grooming business, think of him surrounded by dogs in crazy hairstyles. A humorous image will help you recall his name, as well as a specific fact about him. The more ridiculous the image, the more likely you are to remember it.",
      "Saying it out loud a few times will help you commit to memory. Apply this method during introductions. As you shake the person's hand, you can say, \"Hello, [insert name].\" If a conversation follows, repeat her name throughout the time. If you are unable to speak to the person for long, bid her goodbye and repeat her name again before she leaves. Attempt to use the person's name two or three times throughout the conversation so that you remember it better.   For example, when meeting a new colleague at work named Kira, shake her hand and say, \"Hello, [insert name]. Welcome to the office!\" Include her name when asking her questions, such as, \"What made you interested in working in technology, [insert name]?\" The more often you repeat the person's name right away, the more likely you are to remember it later. If his name is difficult to remember, asking for the correct spelling will give you a visual image. This also works for names you have never heard before, such as \"Honghui\" and \"Kichiro\". As they spell it out, you will be able to envision the way the name in spelled in your head. Also, this method will give you the chance to hear the correct pronunciation of his name again.  This method can be applied to names with different spellings as well. For example, the name \"Shawn\" could also be spelled \"Sean\" or even \"Shon\". By clarifying the spelling of the person's name, you will be able to correctly identify his name. This method cannot be applied to common names, such as \"Harry.\" If you are unable to ask the person to spell his or her name, see if he has a business card. Having a visual image and physical reminder of his name will help you recall it. If it's near the start of the conversation and you forget her name, say, \"I'm sorry, but I didn't catch your name.\" If you're asking later on towards the end of the conversation, in order to sound polite, say something along the lines of, \"I've enjoyed talking to you, but I can't seem to remember your name. Please repeat it for me\". The compliment will soften the blow of having forgotten her name. Although you may feel embarrassed when asking for her name again, following this step will prevent awkward situations from occurring in the future. It is best to apply this method early in the relationship rather than later."

      "Getting Medical Help for Lowering PSA Levels",
      "Lowering PSA Levels Naturally"

    "document": [
      "The vast majority of men get a PSA blood test because they have prostate symptoms — such as deep pelvic pain, discomfort when sitting, trouble urinating, more frequent urination, blood in semen and/or erectile dysfunction; however, many conditions affect the prostate (infection, cancer, benign hypertrophy, spasms) and many causes of increased PSA levels (as noted above). As such, PSA test results are not definitive for cancer because they tend to have many false positives (false alarms). Your doctor will consider the PSA test result also to your personal history, a physical exam of the prostate or possibly a biopsy (tissue sample) of the gland before any diagnosis is made.  It used to be that a PSA test less than 4 ng/mL was thought to be healthy and a reading greater than 10 ng/mL was considered high risk for prostate cancer; however, it's been discovered than men with prostate cancer can have readings below 4 ng/mL and others with healthy prostates can have readings well above 10 ng/mL.  Ask about alternative PSA testing. There are three alternative forms of PSA testing (in addition to the standard one) that doctors now consider: percent-free PSA only looks at the free circulating PSA in the blood, not the total PSA level; PSA velocity uses the results of other PSA tests to determine the change of PSA levels over time; a urine PC3 test looks for a fusion of genes common to at least half of PSA-tested men with prostate cancer. Research conducted in 2008 concluded that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help lower PSA levels when taken regularly. Researchers don't know the exact mechanism of how aspirin impacts the prostate (it wasn't due to shrinking the gland), but regular male users have almost 10% lower PSA levels on average compared to men who don't take aspirin or other NSAIDs; however, talk to your doctor about the risks of taking aspirin long-term, such as stomach irritation, ulcers and reduced clotting ability of blood.  The aspirin users who experience the biggest impact to their PSA levels are men who have advanced prostate cancer and non-smokers. Low-dose coated aspirin (often called baby aspirin) is the safest option for men who want to take the drug long-term (more than a few months). Because aspirin and other NSAIDs \"thin\" the blood (make it less able to clot) there is also reduced risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. Several other medications can potentially lower PSA levels, although most are meant for conditions and diseases not related to the prostate gland. It's never a good idea to take medications for conditions you don't have to lower PSA levels — especially since PSA levels are difficult to interpret and high PSA levels are not always an indication of prostate disease.  Drugs meant for the prostate include 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), which are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia or urinary symptoms. These inhibitors may lower PSA levels as a secondary benefit, but not in every man who takes them.  Cholesterol-lowering medications called statins (Lipitor, Crestor, Zocor) are also linked to lower PSA levels — if they're taken for a few years or more; however, this secondary benefit is canceled out if you're also taking calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure.  Thiazide diuretics are \"water pills\" used to treat high blood pressure. Long-term use of thiazide diuretics is associated with lower PSA levels.",
      "Certain foods seem to affect the prostate gland negatively and increase blood levels of PSA. More specifically, diets rich in dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt) and animal fat (meat, lard, butter) have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. Therefore, switching to a healthy diet that's low in saturated fat and high in antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables can reduce your risk of prostate cancer and lower PSA levels.  Dairy products seem to trigger higher levels of an insulin-like growth factor, which has been connected to high PSA levels and poor prostate health. Other foods to avoid include sugar, saturated fats, fried foods, eggs, potatoes that are not organic, alcohol, and foods from cans with BPA lining. When you eat meat, opt for lower-fat varieties such as turkey and chicken. Low-fat diets may also be connected to improved prostate health overall and reduce the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlargement). Substitute fish for meat more often. Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, herring) are rich in omega-3 fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Dark blue/purple berries and grapes, as well as dark green veggies, tend to be highest in antioxidants, which prevent the damaging effects of oxidation on tissues, organs, and glands (such as the prostate). Along with changing your diet, make sure to avoid exposure to environmental toxins as much as possible. Tomatoes are a rich source of lycopene, which is a carotenoid (plant pigment and antioxidant) that protects tissues from stress and helps them utilize energy better. Diets rich in tomatoes and tomato products (such as tomato sauces and pastes) are linked to lower risks of prostate cancer and contribute to reducing PSA levels circulating in the blood. Lycopene appears to be more bioavailable (easier for the body to absorb and utilize)  when tomatoes are cooked such as when it's in processed products like tomato paste and tomato puree.  Some research indicates that more lycopene may be bioavailable from diced tomatoes cooked with olive oil than those cooked without. Although the main source of lycopene in the American diet is tomato-based products, other sources include apricots, guavas, and watermelons.  If you cannot eat or don't like tomatoes, you can still get the PSA-reducing benefit of lycopene by taking a 4 mg supplement daily. Natural pomegranate juice contains many healthy compounds, some of which positively impact the prostate gland and keep PSA levels low. For example, the seeds, flesh and peels from pomegranates contain powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids, phenolics, and anthocyanins. These phytochemicals are believed to hinder the growth of cancer cells and slow down PSA from accumulating in the blood. Pomegranate juice is also a good source of vitamin C, which stimulates the immune system and allows the body to repair its tissues — both of which positively impact PSA levels.  Try to drink a glass of pomegranate juice each day. If pure pomegranate juice does not appeal to you (too sour), look for a sweeter juice blend that contains pomegranate in it. Select the most natural and pure pomegranate products. Processing tends to destroy phytochemicals and vitamin C. Pomegranate extract is also available in capsules and can be taken as a daily dietary supplement. Pomi-T is a commercially available dietary supplement that contains raw powdered pomegranate, broccoli, green tea, and turmeric. Research in 2013 concluded that Pomi-T significantly lowers PSA levels in patients with prostate cancer. Each of the ingredients are strong antioxidants and have anti-cancer properties, but when they're combined there seems to be a synergistic effect that boosts effectiveness. The research was based on men with prostate cancer taking the supplement for six months. They found that Pomi-T is well tolerated and not thought to cause any negative side effects.  Broccoli is a cruciferous veggie high in sulfur-based compounds, which fight cancer and combat oxidative damage in tissues. The more you cook broccoli, the less beneficial it becomes, so stick with raw varieties. Green tea contains catechins, which are antioxidants that can help kill cancer cells while dropping PSA levels in the blood. If you make a cup of green tea, don't use scalding water because it will reduce some of its antioxidant strength. Turmeric is a strong anti-inflammatory that contains curcumin — the component responsible for lowering PSA levels by restricting the spread of prostate cancer cells. PC-SPES (which means \"hope for prostate cancer\") is a dietary supplement made from the extracts of eight different Chinese herbs. It's been around for many years and commercially available at most health food stores. Research done in 2000 concluded that PC-SPES can significantly reduce PSA levels in men with advanced prostate disease. Researchers believe that PC-SPES acts somewhat like estrogen (the main female hormone) by lowering testosterone levels in men, which shrinks the prostate and reduces PSA levels.  All the men studied who took PC-SPES for two years (nine capsules daily) had their PSA levels drop by 80% or more, and the decline lasted for over a year after they stopped the supplements. PC-SPES is a mixture of Baikal skullcap, chrysanthemum flowers, Reishi mushrooms, isatis, licorice root, ginseng root (Panax ginseng), rabdosia rubescens and saw palmetto berries."

      "If your car has its original paint job, you can do an online search for your car's make, model, color, and the words \"paint code.\" You can also look on the car for the code if you can't find it online. Check the door jam, near the VIN number, and on firewall (bulkhead) to find the paint code number. Go to your local auto parts store or contact your car dealership with your paint color in hand. If you have a common car, they will likely have touch up paint for your paint job in stock. If you have an unusual or rare car, they may have to order your touch up paint.  Touch up paint comes in several types of containers. It often comes in small jars of the paint or in paint pens. It's important to get an exact match to your car's color, so don't settle on a color that is just close to your car's. Light-colored cars can be difficult to find a perfect color match. Consult an auto paint specialist if you are having difficulty finding the right color. Before touching the chipped area up, it’s important to prevent rust from spreading underneath your touch-up job in the future. Paint on a small amount of rust inhibitor over the chipped area before the primer. Squeeze a dab of primer onto the area if the chip reaches metal. If the chip is surface-level, you can skip this step. Primer is needed for deep chips because regular paint will not adhere to bare metal.  Spread the primer around the small chip with a tiny brush. Only use enough primer for one thin coat. Allow the primer to dry completely. Avoid getting primer on the car paint outside of the chipped area. It will ruin the finish. Apply some of the paint to an area on the car that isn't visible, such as the lip under a door. It is important to make sure the paint you've purchased will not react poorly to your existing paint and also that it matches well. Spread 2 to 3 layers of touch-up paint on the area. The touched-up spot will look elevated above the rest of the paint, which is how it should look.  If the paint chip is on a vertical surface on your car, it’s especially important to wait until the touch-up paint dries between layers so it doesn't run. The painted area should be raised so that it can be sanded down smooth with the rest of the paint job once it is dry. Between each layer let the paint dry for an hour. This will ensure that each layer is set and doesn't get smeared by the next. Also, wait at least 24 hours before continuing the process after you have applied all your layers.",
      "the car. Focus on deep cleaning the area where the paint is chipped. Making sure the area is clean will help you identify all the spots that need to be touched up and will reduce the risk of getting dirt and grime in the new paint.  Use car washing soap, water, and a clean, soft cloth to clean the scratched area.  Be sure to thoroughly dry the area that is scratched after you wash it. Look at the scratched area for discoloration on the metal. If you find an area that is dark red or brown, it is likely rust. Use sand paper to remove all areas of discoloration and then wipe down the area with a dry cloth to remove any dust. It’s important to remove any wax on areas that need to have paint adhere to them. Wax isn’t typically removed by soap and water, so a specific remover is needed. Wax removers are available at most auto parts stores. These rust removal products are made specifically for removing rust on the bodies of cars. Use a small piece of sandpaper to sand all around the scratch. Try to remove all loose paint from the area while you sand. This process will also give the touch-up paint a clean surface to stick to. Wash the area with water to remove any leftover debris from the pre-treating process. Allow the area to dry thoroughly before moving on to the next step.",
      "Start by sanding the area with 1000-grit sandpaper, making sure to move very slowly and gently. Once the touched-up area appears close to level with the rest of the pain, continue to sand gently with 2000-grit sandpaper. After that, rub the area with 3000-grit sandpaper until the touch-up paint is even with the rest of the vehicle.  As your sandpaper gets finer, it will remove less and less of the paint. Don’t be tempted to push really hard with the sandpaper because of this. It is ok if you sand a small amount of the surrounding painted area. This will be fixed by the top coat you will apply over the whole area. Paint the top coat over the entire area that is discolored. Typically this includes the chipped area and the existing paint surrounding it that has been lightly sanded. Try to get the top coat as smooth and even as possible, using a clean brush, even strokes, as several thin layers.  Allow your top coat to dry for 10 to 20 minutes between coats. It’s best to apply several thin coats instead of one thick coat. Follow the directions that came on your top-coat container. In some cases they will tell you to apply several coats and in others the directions will state that one coat is enough. Giving the surface one last sanding will ensure that the clear coat you applied is smooth and blended with the existing top coat. Sand it until the repaired area is flush with the rest of the paint surface on the car. and wax the entire car. Once you have repaired your paint chips it’s nice to give your whole car a bit of care. Polishing and waxing the car will help the repaired area blend in with the rest of the paint job and it will protect the fixed area from more damage."

      "Rhubarb needs a year to get fully established, so you'll need to wait until the second year before harvesting any stalks. They should be 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) long. Continue harvesting throughout the summer - the season should last 8 to 10 weeks. Harvest rhubarb in late May or June by cutting the stems off with a sharp knife at soil level. It is best to harvest several times, removing a few stems from each plant each time. Harvesting the crop slowly allows the remaining stems to draw on the energy of the plant.   Always leave at least two stalks per plant so that it can store up energy for next year. This will ensure that you have a harvest next year.  Harvesting season is over when the stalks start growing up thin. #*Some rhubarb plants will keep coming back for up to 20 years once established. in the refrigerator. If you aren't going to use it immediately, store it in an airtight food storage bag in the refrigerator. It will keep this way for up to a week. You may also cut the rhubarb stalks into chunks and freeze them in a freezer-safe container for several months. Cherry red rhubarb stalks are usually cooked in dessert dishes, since they lend a tangy, bright flavor to pies and tarts. Enjoy your garden-grown rhubarb in one of these recipes:    Rhubarb pie. This classic rhubarb dish won't disappoint. The rhubarb is cooked with sugar and strawberries for a delicious filling.   Rhubarb crumble. This is another rhubarb dessert that's quicker to make than pie, but no less satisfying.   Rhubarb cream. The flavor of rhubarb is mixed with honey and cream to make a delightful topping for any dessert.   Rhubarb ice cream. Nothing could be more delicious than ice cream made with fresh garden produce.",
      "Use hay and cow manure to keep weeds from growing and continue to nourish the rhubarb plants. Leaf mulch or ramial wood chips also make good mulches. Your rhubarb bed should stay moist and well-drained throughout the heat of the summer. Water every time the soil begins to look dry. Seed stalks keep the rest of the rhubarb plant from growing tall and strong, since they use up the plant's energy. Rhubarb isn't prone to getting many pests, but you may notice a beetle called the rhubarb curculio on the stalks. This beetle is light gray and about half an inch long. Pick off the beetles one at a time. Don't use pesticide to kill them, as this may damage your rhubarb plants. After the first year has passed, use a light application of high-nitrogen fertilizer to encourage the rhubarb to come back healthy. Do this after the ground has started to thaw.",
      "Rhubarb is a cool-season plant that requires temperatures that drop below 40 °F (4 °C) in order to stimulate growth. The northern states in the US as well as Canada are good places to grow rhubarb. Check your growing zone to find out if you can grow rhubarb in the climate where you live.  Rhubarb grows best in USDA hardiness zones 3-8. This includes much of the northern parts of the Midwest as well as the northeastern regions of the US. Rhubarb wilts during the heat of hot southern summers. If you live in a southern region where it regularly goes above 75 °F (24 °C), it will probably be difficult to grow this plant. Rhubarb is best grown from roots (crowns), not seed, since the seeds take a long time to get established and there's no guarantee they'll ever germinate. Go to your local nursery and buy rhubarb roots or purchase some from an online source.  If you have a friend with a rhubarb plant, you may be able to dig up a crown from the side of their plant to get yours started. Rhubarb should be planted in an area in full sun. Look for a spot that drains well, since rhubarb won't do as well if water sits around its base. To determine whether soil drains well, dig a hole and fill it with water. If the water sits in the hole, the soil there doesn't drain well. If it immediately soaks into the ground, the soil is great for planting rhubarb. You may want to stick a ruler in the hole so that you can measure how quickly it drains. Ideally the water should drain out at a rate of 1-3 inches per hour. If it drains too fast, your plant will dry out; too slow and the roots may rot. Clear out weeds and other plants that may interfere with the rhubarb plants. Till your gardening bed to a depth of several feet and mix in plenty of compost, rotted manure or other organic matter to enrich the soil. This step is essential, since rhubarb needs plenty of nutrients to grow well.   You can also consider  building a raised bed to plant your rhubarb and other vegetables. This way you can control the soil drainage and weed population more easily. Don't treat the area with herbicides or pesticides; rhubarb should only be planted in clean soil.  Don't use chemical fertilizer to treat the soil during the first year of growth; only organic material should be used until the second or third year. Rhubarb plants can grow to become quite large, so it's important to give them plenty of space. Dig the holes in rows. Place the roots in the holes and gently fill them in with compost-rich soil. Water the roots after planting."

      "Baking soda is basic, with a pH value of 9. Drop 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of it into a glass of water, and then stir briskly with a spoon or whisk. Keep stirring until all of the crumbs of baking soda have dissolved. Then, measure the water’s pH again using a litmus strip. If you started with neutral water (pH 7), the water’s pH should have increased up to about 8. Mix the 2 liquids together using a spoon. Then dip a strip of litmus paper into the water. Wait a few seconds, and note how the pH level of the water has changed. Since lemon juice is acidic, with a pH value of 2, the pH level of a neutral glass of water should have lowered to a 6 or 5. Many common liquids and dissolvable substances found around the home will alter the pH level of water. Dissolve or mix a small amount of one substance at a time into a glass of clean water, and then test with a litmus strip. If you’re performing a science experiment, make a chart on which you can record the pH values of water with different substances added, each to a separate glass of water. Try adding:  Coke. Red wine. Milk. Liquid soap or shampoo.",
      "Fish are very sensitive to the pH in their water and can die if the water becomes too acidic or too basic. Most species of fish thrive in relatively neutral water, close to 7 on the pH scale. If the water has become too basic, add peat moss to lower the pH. If the water is too acidic, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baking soda per every 5 gallons (19 L) of water to raise the pH.  Look online or visit a local pet store to find out the specific water-level pH needs of the breeds of fish you have. For example, if you’re keeping koi fish, they prefer basic water with a pH range between 7.5 and 8.2.  You can purchase clumps of peat at your local pet store. Put 1 clump of peat into a mesh bag, and place this inside of your fish tank’s water filter. The peat will lower the acid level over time. Rapid changes in pH can have a harmful effect on your fish. Remove the fish from your tank before adjusting the pH. Test the pH level in your fish tank both before and after making an adjustment. Also test pH before and after altering pH levels in pools or drinking water, as per the relevant section of this article. Most houseplants thrive when given slightly acidic water, between 5.5 and 6.5. If you’ve measured your tap water and found that it’s basic (or too acidic), you’ll need to adjust the water’s pH level before watering your plants. Lime or wood ash can be added to a 1 gallon (3.8 L) container of water to raise the pH. To lower the pH, add phosphoric acid or a tablet designed to lower water pH.  If you’re unsure about the ideal pH level for the specific type of plant you’re watering, check online or at a local plant nursery. Some plants are very pH sensitive and need water at an exact pH level. For example, onions thrive when given more basic water at a pH of 6.5-7.0.  Consult your local plant nursery to determine the exact amount of pH-altering substances to add. You can also buy lime, wood, ash, and phosphoric acid or other pH-lowering substances at the nursery. If you repeatedly water plants with water outside of the 5.5–6.5 range, they will begin to wither and die. Swimming pools should be maintained at a slightly basic pH, between 7.2 and 7.8. The pH in pools tends to rise on its own, so you’ll likely need to lower the pool pH from time to time. Pool manufacturers make chemical substances for this purpose. The 2 most common are sodium bisulfate and muriatic acid. Either substance should be added directly to the pool water.  For more detailed instructions on raising or lowering the pH level in your pool, consult the manufacturer’s recommendations for your specific model. You can purchase sodium bisulfate (also called “dry acid”) or muriatic acid at any pool supply store. The water that you drink should be neutral, with a pH value at (or very close to) 7. If you’ve tested the pH of your drinking water and found that it’s acidic or basic, make adjustments to balance the water’s pH. If the drinking water is acidic (low pH number), add pH drops or tablets to neutralize the acid. Alternately, if your drinking water is basic (high pH number), add a few drops of lemon juice, which is naturally acidic.  If you’d like the pH level to be permanently adjusted, you can have a permanent water filtration system installed. If your water is basic, install a neutralizing filter or a soda ash/sodium hydroxide injection system.  If your water is acidic, professionals from a local home-supply store can install an acid-injection system to your house’s water supply.",
      "pH testing strips—also called litmus strips—are thin, small sheets of paper, each about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long by 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) wide. They are coated with a chemical solution which changes color when exposed to basic or acidic substances. pH strips can be purchased at most health-food stores or at any science supply store. You can also purchase pH strips at major online retailers, or at most pet-supply stores. Place about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the pH strip into water. Dip either side; the entire strip is pH sensitive. Be sure to keep a firm hold on one end of the strip, though, so that it doesn’t slip into the water you’re planning to measure.  For example, draw a glass of water from your tap if you’re trying to ascertain the pH of the drinking water. Or, if you’re trying to adjust the pH level in a fish tank, dip a strip into the water at the top of the tank. Alternately, you can use a water dropper to place 1 or 2 drops of water directly onto the center of the litmus strip. Once the pH strip has been submerged for at least 10 seconds, pull it out and look at the end. The pH strip will have changed color to indicate the presence of base or acid in the water. If the color of the strip doesn’t change immediately, wait a few seconds. Your pH testing kit should have come with a color chart. The chart indicates the color that litmus paper will turn when exposed to a basic or acidic substance. Match the color of the pH strip to a color on the chart, and you’ll have a good idea of the water’s pH. In broad terms, a red litmus strip indicates highly acidic water, yellow indicates mildly acidic, green indicates mildly basic, and purple indicates highly acidic. Litmus strips are a quick and effective gauge of pH levels, but are not the most precise method of measurement. A digital probe reader (often called a “pH meter”) is a much more accurate device, which will determine the pH of a liquid to 2 decimal places. To use the pH meter, submerge the tip of the instrument in water until the display shows the pH reading.  pH meters are commonly used in science labs and can be purchased or rented through science-supply stores. The pH meter may need to be re-calibrated between each usage. Follow the printed directions included with the meter for best results."

      "This applies to desktop as well (you'll find it in the bottom-right corner of the page). You should see a couple of options appear:   Photo (mobile)/Upload a pin (desktop) - Allows you to select a photo from your device's default \"Pictures\" album.  Website (mobile)/Save from a website (desktop) - Lets you search for a website (or enter a link to one), then search the resulting site for pin-compatible items. On mobile, you also have the option of tapping Copied Link to navigate to the last link you copied. This option is functionally the same as tapping Website. From here, uploading a pin will vary based on your choice:  If you chose to upload a photo, you'll have to allow Pinterest access to your device (mobile) or click Choose photos (desktop). You can then browse through your device's pictures to select the one you wish to upload. If you chose to use a website, you'll enter the website's URL into the provided text field. Once the site finishes loading, you should see a list of all media that you can pin--though, on iPhone, you must first tap Save in the top-right corner before you see this list. Again, this process will vary slightly depending on your chosen upload path, but you'll tap or click the photo you wish to save. Doing so will add your pin to the board in question. You can also add a description to your item in the field to the right of the item's icon.",
      "Remember, it's a magnifying glass on mobile, and a \"Search\" bar at the top of the page on desktop. You can do this by typing a search query into the search bar, or you can simply return to the Home page to view Pinterest's suggestions. Doing so will open it. This option is in the top-right corner of pinned items on iPhone and desktop, and in the bottom-right corner of items on Android. Doing so will add your pin to the board in question. As with uploaded pins, you can also add a description to your item in the field to the right of the item's icon.",
      "You can use keywords or more specific search terms to find boards and people to follow. For example, if you want to follow a board that posts pictures of kittens, you might type \"kittens\" into the search bar. You don't need to do this on desktop, since the \"Filter\" options are in the second row of tabs below the search bar. You'll select Boards to show only boards displaying your search term, or People to find Pinterest users to follow. On Android, tap Pinners to filter based on people. This option is below a board or person. Doing so will cause you to follow the board or person in question.",

Now that you have a place to store content, you're ready to upload and save some pins. You can also hide your board from other Pinterest users by selecting the Keep board secret switch (called Secret on desktop).",
      "You can do so by tapping the Pinterest app (mobile), or by going to https://www.pinterest.com/.  If you haven't created a Pinterest account yet, you'll need to create an account before continuing. You may need to sign into Pinterest by entering your email address and password when prompted (on desktop, click Sign In in the top-right corner of the page). This is where all of your favorited topics will appear, as well as followed boards and users.  You can get back to the Home page at any time by clicking or tapping the Pinterest logo. It's in the top-left corner of the screen for Android and desktop users, and the bottom-left corner for iPhone users. Android users won't see the Home page button when in another menu (e.g., the profile page); instead, you'll have to tap the \"Back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen to return to the Home page. You'll do so by clicking or tapping the person-shaped icon that's in either the bottom-right corner of the screen (iPhone) or the top-right side of the page (Android and desktop). You can view your personal boards--and their accompanying pins--here. You'll also be able to change your settings by tapping or clicking the hexagonal \"Settings\" icon near the top of the page. To do so, tap or click the speech bubble icon that's in either the bottom-right area of the screen (iPhone) or the top-right section of the page (Android and desktop). This is where you'll see messages alerting you to new posts from people you're following, new followers, and your friends' activity. You can also select the Inbox tab at the top of the Notifications page to view private conversations and send your own. You'll use the search bar to do this; the search function is accessible by tapping the magnifying glass icon (iPhone and Android), or by simply clicking the bar with \"Search\" written in it at the top of the page on desktop. As you type, you should see search suggestions related to your typing appear below the search bar.  You can select a search suggestion to search Pinterest for that suggestion exactly. You can also press your device's \"Enter\" button to search for your search term verbatim. Clicking Explore to the right of the search bar will open a page with currently trending topics, rising and new topics, content suggestions tailored for your preferences, and more. This will take you to your profile page, where you can get started by creating your first board."

      "Addressing Emotional Clutter"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Many people's homes are plagued by unnecessary clutter. Clutter can make a home feel chaotic, leading to excess stress. Do a quick sweep through your house and see if you can find any items you no longer need. Donate or discard the items accordingly.  Look through closets and drawers. Do you have any clothing you no longer wear? Are there any electronic gadgets you haven't used for years? Maybe it's time to stop hanging on and either toss these items or find a place to donate them. Go through your kitchen and bathroom. Dispose of any expired spices, canned foods, or boxed foods. Throw out old lotions, shampoos, and makeup containers. Get rid of any expired medicine or empty medicine bottles. If you want to be more organized, lists and schedules can be a great way to keep on track. Make a habit of writing daily to-do lists, and organizing your day around a logical schedule for activities.  Figure out what your obligations are for the coming month or weeks. Write down everything you need to do, like doctor's appointments, errands, work commitments, and so on. Prioritize these items. How vital is it you get your doctor's appointment taken care of? If you need a prescription refilled, make an appointment for the next week. If you have a big commitment at work, like a presentation, break it up into small chunks and set weekly goals. You should also make small lists for weekly errands. For example, make a list before going to the grocery store. In addition to helping you get out of the store quicker, a list can help discourage you from overspending. You want to know where everything you need is at all times. Whether it's your office at work, or your home, work on organizing your space so you can work more efficiently.  Organize items in your home by purpose. Keep the books on a separate shelf than the DVDs. Have a designated bin or cabinet for office supplies. At work, do not stack papers randomly. Have different folders for different types of documents. Keep important items places where you can easily reach them. Install a key hook in your home, for example. In your kitchen, organize spices by purpose. The ones you use most frequently should be at the front of your spice rack. You can push the others back. Many people struggle with paying bills promptly and returning emails regularly. Having bills and emails under control can help your life feel significantly more organized.  Color coordinate emails in your inbox. You can mark high priority emails in a certain color as this will help you remember to return them promptly. You can also work on setting aside a time of day to return emails. For example, you can plan on always returning emails between 11 AM and 2 PM. Set up automatic bill pay if it's offered for your various bills. Mark when your bills are due on your phone calendar, or on a physical calendar. If you're feeling overwhelmed as you attempt to reorganize, do not hesitate to ask for help. Everyone needs a little push now and then. If you have a friend who is well organized, ask him or her to offer you tips. You may also simply ask a friend to hang out with you as you organize your home. The company can make the process less taxing.",
      "If you want to stay organized and on top of things, solid sleep is vital. Work on establishing a healthy sleep cycle so you'll have the energy you need to stay organized and on-track throughout the day.  Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day. Your body will adapt to a regular sleep/wake cycle, so try to stay on schedule even on the weekends. Form a relaxing bedtime ritual to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. You could read a book, do a crossword puzzle, take a warm bath, and so on. Just avoid using your computer close to bed time, as blue light emitted from electronic screens can stimulate your brain and make sleep difficult. Make sure your room is comfortable. If there are any sheets, blankets, or pillows that irritate your skin, replace them with higher quality items. A great way to reorganize your life is to find a new way to pass the time. Think about starting a new hobby. This can give you something to do during your down time, reducing feelings of stress or boredom.  Find something that interests you personally. Many people find doing something creative, like writing or playing a musical instrument, can help them feel balanced and fulfilled. You can also look into getting active. Exercise can make you feel more relaxed and boost your energy, allowing you to take the time necessary to get your life in shape. You could take up running, jogging, walking, biking, or any form of physical activity you enjoy. Organization and cleaning must happen on a regular basis. Your new, clean apartment or house will not stay that way if you don't commit to regular cleaning. Get on a schedule of cleaning, reorganizing, and downsizing on a regular basis.  You can set specific days of the week aside for cleaning. For example, maybe you have Tuesday afternoons off. This might be a good time to work on giving your house a quick cleaning. You may want to set aside a day once a month to reorganize and declutter. You can, for example, take the first Saturday of each month as a chance to get rid of unwanted items in your home and reorganize anything that's not working. Your career is important, but if it's eating up your ability to relax you may have trouble staying organized and on track. Find ways to find a solid work/life balance so you can feel happier and more fulfilled in your life.  Track your time in a journal. See how much time you spend on work per week. You should also track how work affects your mood, and the time you spend worrying or angry over work. Form a schedule for yourself. Set aside time at least once a day for yourself. Allow yourself not to think about work during certain blocks of time. For example, at 6 o'clock every night you'll play the piano for an hour and not think about your job. Talk with co-workers. They may also struggle with work/life balance, especially if you work in a demanding field, and may have advice on how to find the balance.",
      "If you want to reorganize your life, you need to cut out relationships that are putting a strain on you. You should not be putting time and energy into people who cause drama. People who drain your time and energy, treat you poorly, or who are emotionally manipulative should be cut out of your life.  Establish boundaries with these people and stick to them. You may, for example, be okay hanging out with your co-worker Melinda in the presence of others as not to create unnecessary drama. However, you may not want to see Melinda one-on-one as she tends to be difficult. In some cases, it's okay to tell someone directly you do not want to see them again. If the person is not taking the hint that you do not want a relationship, politely say something like, \"I don't think this friendship is working for me anymore. I appreciate the time we've had together, but I think we should both move on.\" Another way to reorganize your life is to not leave major decisions lingering. If you've been putting off making a decision about your job, your personal life, your health insurance, or other matters, now is the time to make the decision. You want to move forward without uncertainty.  Think about any lingering decisions in your life. Maybe you're unsure whether you should stay in your current romantic relationship. Try to weigh the pros and cons. Is this someone you could be with longterm? If so, it may be worth your time to stay. If not, consider whether casual dating is for you right now. Do you want to invest time in a relationship you know will eventually end? Start thinking about your career. Does your current job offer advancement? Do you see yourself on this path for the next 5 to 10 years? If you want to leave your job, make a solid decision to leave rather than letting the maybe/maybe not thought linger. This can motivate you to begin sending out applications. You may have a lot of negative and irrational thoughts about yourself and the world. In order to move forward with your life, work on identifying and disengaging from your own negativity.  People end up having negative thoughts a lot throughout the day. You may, for example, catastrophize. This means you see the worse possible outcome for any given situation. You could also have a tendency to engage in black and white thinking. Instead of seeing a setback as a chance for personal growth, you see it as solely bad rather than a mixed blessing. Work on being on the lookout for negative thoughts. When you find yourself having an extreme reaction to something, pause for a minute and question whether that reaction is accurate. Try to remind yourself that life is nuanced, and most situations are complicated. Consider all the factors in a situation before categorizing it as good or bad, and remind yourself that much of life's setbacks and rejections are not personal. Your life may be cluttered with excessive activities. Being busy does not necessarily translate to being successful or to being happy. If you feel overwhelmed by obligations, take stock of the activities in your life and look to where you can minimize.  Stick with activities you genuinely enjoy and you feel benefit you in some way. If you feel genuinely fulfilled attending your weekly poetry club, and it's helping you get some of your work out there, stick with this activity. However, not all activities are beneficial. There may be activities in your life that are causing you more stress than happiness. Maybe you don't really enjoy being on your church's vestry, and only do it out of a sense of obligation. If this is the case, you should consider cutting this activity. There are plenty of other volunteers who can take your place."

    ],
    "document": [
      "In order to demonstrate to your readers that your review is reliable, make sure to conduct as much research as possible before you begin writing. A thorough knowledge of the product, its evolution and its competition will allow you to write something approaching an expert review.  Read the manufacturer's website, as well as any manufacturer information included with the product you are reviewing. Beware of publicity material released by manufacturers and retailers - readers will often stop reading if they sense that publicity material is being used rather than observations drawn from real-life experience. Look into the competition and research the benefits and flaws of products that consumers consider alternatives. This will allow you to compare and contrast the reviewed product with the often numerous alternative products on the market. Buying or renting a product for review is the easiest way to get prepared for a review. However, you may be able to obtain a product directly from the manufacturer or retailer for free if you are persistent.  If you have a blog and wish to post reviews, contact companies through e-mail, a phone call, or even traditional mail. Make sure to be up front about the type of blog you write and the traffic it receives, and keep your message short and to the point. Larger companies may employ a marketing or sales representative. If this is the case, contact the appropriate representative and pitch your review directly to them. Using and getting to know the product you are reviewing are perhaps the most important aspects of writing a product review. Readers will be looking for genuine knowledge of and experience with a product when they read your review.  Fake reviews that are full of exaggerated praise or criticism are widespread on the internet, and most people will stop reading a review if they suspect it is written with ulterior motives. A genuine appraisal of a product is the best way to draw a reader's attention.   Providing a photograph or video of your interaction with the product will demonstrate to your readers that you have actually used it, and will lend credibility to the review. There are several reasons why potential buyers read product reviews, and you should think about these as you research and use the product before writing your review. Common questions readers would like answered include:  Is the product easy to use? Is it of a high quality? Is it geared towards somebody like me? Have others had a good experience with the product? What are the pros and cons of the product? What alternatives are available, and how do they measure up? Is the product worth my money?",
      "A good review introduction will not only hook the reader, but also provide a clear picture of the product under review and the product's advertised benefits.  For first-time users, dedicate some space to explaining the functionality of the product in some detail, treating the product as if all the features are new. Teaching new customers about a product is an important aspect of a product review. For experienced consumers, focus on the evolution of a product from one model to the next, as well as any common defects or problems users may have encountered in the past. Long-time users of a product will often read reviews for solutions to problems, giving you a chance to demonstrate your knowledge of a product. Provide the reader with the basic information a consumer likes to know before buying a product. This may include brand name, model number, measurements, target demographic, price, and so on. Talk about what you liked AND what you didn't like about the product. The most helpful reviews are those that outline both the pros and cons of a product, while readers will most likely skip reviews full of effusive praise or bitter criticism.  Make sure to clearly explain how you arrived at your judgments, and specifically address why you believe certain features are beneficial and why you consider others flaws. Most people will be looking for an unbiased review of a product, and thus a clearly explained, balanced review is more likely to be read than a review that focuses too much on the positive or negative aspects of a product (unless warranted, of course). Discuss the product under review in light of similar products available to buyers, comparing the pros and cons of each. This will both demonstrate your research and knowledge, and provide the reader with a point of reference when making their next purchase. This is particularly important for first-time buyers who may require a point of reference before deciding to purchase. Describe for the reader who you believe would benefit the most from the product, which will help them to decide whether the product is right for them. Points of interest may include how easy or difficult the product is to use, specific features that will appeal to particular audiences, as well as how the product relates to other products readers may have used in the past. A good conclusion will summarize the benefits and flaws of the product, evaluate whether the product lives up to the company's marketing, and communicate your opinion on whether the product offers good value. Choose the most appropriate forum for your review and post the it online. There are countless online venues for product reviews; some of the most popular include blogs, dedicated product review sites, and product retailers. Allow some time to pass between the release of a product and the publishing of your review. This will allow you time to properly test the product and arrive at an honest evaluation. Readers will more often trust a reviewer who can demonstrate that they have spent some time with a product before offering a review."

      "Not all yurts require insulation or lining, but they conserve heat and protect your yurt from the elements. Install your insulation on a day that is not very windy, and do this once the rafters are all in place. Use a step ladder to reach the top middle of your yurt, and spread the liner over the rafters. Have a friend pull the hemmed end around the rafter ends. Then, place the insulation on top of the liner. You can secure the upper area while your friend secures the perimeter.  To secure the lining and insulation, use a staple gun to add a staple every 4–8 in (10–20 cm). Once the insulation seam is aligned properly, use the foil tape to secure the seam. If you’d like, trim the insulation around the door frame so it does not get in the way. Remove the cover from the bag and get rid of the binding straps. The cover of your yurt is often in a bag made of the same material. Untie the straps around the cover. Then, place your step ladder inside your yurt so you can unroll the cover. To do this, bring the top of the covering through the center ring opening. Once the covering is through the opening, you can let the covering unroll until it reaches your door. As you stand on the step ladder, have a friend work around the perimeter. Once the covering is unrolled, unfold it 2-3 times to cover a bit in each direction. As you do this, look for the cut-out opening for the door in the top cover valance. The cut-out has many oval grommets, rather than round grommets.  Ensure the cut-out is centered over the door so you can easily install the rest of the covering. Work with your friend to unfold the rest of the covering across the top and perimeter of the yurt. Once the covering is halfway unfolded and covers half of your rafters, install a 2-5 twist-lock connectors or S-clips to secure the top cover at the door. Securing the cover near the door keeps the door detail aligned. Then, tie a cord to a few of the grommets on the top cover. Use the cord to help pull the rest of the fabric over the center ring and around the perimeter. Finally, pull the outside edge around so it is snug around the ends of the rafters.  It is imperative that the top cover is centered on the center ring and pulled down evenly. If not, your covering will be crooked. You do not need to fasten the cover to the center ring. Once the covering is in place, inspect the door frame to make sure everything fits properly. Then, use a marker to indicate the oval grommet locations. Drill 7⁄64 ft (0.033 m) pilot holes with the provided bits, and then fasten the twist-lock connectors.  If you don’t drill pilot holes, you may break the twist-lock shank. If you overtighten the twist-lock connectors, you can also break the shank. Once your roof is in place, consult your instructions regarding any specific finishing touches.",
      "The lattice wall often comes in a cylindrical package about 2 ft (0.61 m) in diameter and 8 ft (2.4 m) long (for a 12–16 ft (3.7–4.9 m) yurt). Remove the lattice wall, and have a helper assist you in moving it to the back of the circular platform. Start by undoing the straps around the lattice wall. Ensure the outside is facing the outward direction and the inside of the wall is facing toward your platform. Then, stretch out the lattice around the perimeter, just inside the drip edge. As you do this, keep the lattice wall stable by holding it securely.  The outside of the lattice has holes in the middle of the rivets, while the inside has no holes. Keep your fingers out of the way, or they can get pinched as you unfold the lattice. This creates the circular shape of your structure. You want enough space to position your door frame at your opening, though you can place your door wherever you'd like. To install the door, remove the wingnuts and washers from inside the door frame, and slip the end of the plate with the oval hole onto the clamp bolts. Then, replace the washers and wingnuts and twist them into place.  Ensure that the key side of the door faces outward. Consult your instructions if you have any trouble installing the door. It should be easy and straightforward. There may be a notch in the door threshold behind the door frame. Make sure the door threshold is outside of the drip edge. Use a tape measure to check the height of your structure every 2–3 ft (0.61–0.91 m). Make adjustments to the lattice wall as needed by repositioning the wall. Your finished height depends on your overall yurt size. Once your lattice wall is properly placed, you can attach it to the door. Remove the cap nuts, washers, and bolts located along the bottom of the lattice about every 6th crotch. Then, attach the lattice wall anchoring straps using the included screws. Hold the anchor into place, and line a screw up with the hole. Then, use your drill to secure the screw in place.  The crotch of the lattice refers to where 2 pieces of wood intersect. These brackets are made so the screws go through the drip edge and the flooring material. The anchors and screws come in your yurt kit. Once the door frame and lattice walls are attached, make any final adjustments if you need to. Then, lay the belly band along the top of the lattice wall. Tie 1 end of the belly band to the hook in the top door frame, then feed the band through each crotch of the lattice. As you go, remove the slack in the line. Finally, tie the belly band to the opposite door frame hook when you reach the other side.  Belly bands are nylon or other stretchy, strong straps. They are usually 50 ft (15 m) long. Alternatively, your kit may come with tension cables instead of belly bands. These often hook onto the door instead of tying to it. After everything is securely fastened, make adjustments as needed to improve the shape of the yurt.",
      "To prevent any weather damages, be mindful of where you set up your yurt. The best spot will be protected from wind, receive sun in the morning, get shade in the afternoon, and be free of any overhead objects.  This way, your structure will stay safe and secure. Overhead items include dead tree limbs, for example. The particular size of your platform depends on the overall diameter of your structure. These instructions are for a yurt with a 12 ft (3.7 m) diameter, so review your particular instructions before you start and adjust the process as necessary.  If your platform is not the same size and shape, your yurt may not be completely weatherproof. You want the side cover fabric to extend below the interior floor level for a draft-free, watertight seal. The platform is the hardest and most complex part of building a yurt. If you are not familiar with carpentry work, hire a professional contractor to make your base. This is the easiest way to ensure you build your yurt safely and correctly. If you’d like to try building the platform yourself, review the instructions from your specific yurt manufacturer. Many companies offer preliminary instructions on building your base yourself. These instructions will vary based on your particular yurt kit. Use 10 or so concrete footings to make the base of your platform. The overall placement will depend on your particular framing plan, but in general the footings should be 2–4 ft (0.61–1.22 m) apart in a 12 ft (3.7 m) circular shape. Use precast concrete footings. Use a table saw to cut your wooden beams based on your floor plan. Then, place the beams across the footings, and use a level to ensure each beam is straight. Finally, fasten the beams to the footings using the attached holders on the wooden beams.  For assistance with this process, ask your professional carpenter. Your specific beam placement will depend on your instructions. You can use 1.125 in (2.86 cm) thick plywood to create your flooring. Lay the boards over top of your beams so they are flat and parallel, and secure them on each side using a drill and a screw. Insert a screw through the plywood and the beam every 6–12 in (15–30 cm). The size and width of your flooring depends on your particular instructions. Using a hand saw, go around the edges and cut off any piece of plywood that hangs over your beams. This maintains the overall circular shape of your yurt. Make your cuts so the flooring and beams are flush. It’s okay if the sides aren’t completely even. Try your best to cut the wood as straight as possible. This seals the flooring and the drip edge. The drip edge is the outer edge of the yurt, and it is important to seal the edge and the flooring so no moisture gets inside. To do this, run a thin, even line of caulking around the perimeter of the flooring. This way, your wood is secured together and rain or condensation will not seep into your yurt. Cut 3⁄8 ft (0.11 m) exterior plywood into strips, based on your desired width. Hold the strips around the perimeter of the drip edge, and use a drill and large wood screws to fasten the strips of wood. Add 1 screw to each end of the strip.  When you do this, you want 1 ft (0.30 m) of plywood to extend above the floor level. Use a table saw to cut your strips to your desired size.",
      "Treat the interior of the yurt as a hard-hat zone until the rafters are installed, as the rafters can fall on your head. Once the rafters are installed, you can take off your hard hat. While raising the center ring and installing the rafters is an exciting part of the assembly, it should be executed with care. Children or observers not involved with assembly should stay outside of the yurt. To easily install the center ring, keep the bolt heads down and the nutted ends up. Then, use a marker to make a spot for 3-4 evenly-spaced holes around the circle. The distance between each spot will depend on the size of your center ring. Then, mark each spot where the “set up “ rafters will rest on the cable, based on your instructions.  If you need help with this step, take a look at your rafter spacing diagram. Your marks are where you insert the “set up” rafters to raise the center ring. Align your rafter at 1 of the spots you made on the center ring. Use your hands to lift up the ring, and insert the pin of the rafter into the ring to attach it. Then, repeat the procedure for your second rafter. To attach the third rafter, raise the ring off of the ground. When you lift up the center ring, let the first 2 rafters support 1 side. Then, insert the pin of the third rafter into the marked hole. Lift the center ring into position using the third rafter. Maintain pressure on the first 2 rafters, and place the notched end of the rafter on the cable.  There is a metal pin on the side of the rafter that easily slides into the center ring. When attaching your rafters, be sure to follow the marked holes and cable spaces. It is helpful to have a friend stand close with another rafter to push the ring up. Until you have a few rafters in place, it may be a bit tricky. To insert the rafter, put the end with the pin in completely, move the other end to the cable, push the lattice wall slightly outward with your shoulder, and hook the rafter to the cable. Install the rafters over your doors as your final step, since these rafters help hold the belly band or tension cables in place. Keep your rafter pattern symmetrical to balance the weight and placement. It is also helpful to keep 2 lattice wall crotches in between each rafter.  Once you angle the rafter correctly, the rafter easily slides into place. Do not force the rafter into the ring. Alternatively, stand outside the structure, put the rafter over the lattice walls, and push the end into one of the slots along the roof ring.  When you have 4-6 rafters secure, the person holding the center support can let go and get out of the way. The number of rafters you need depends on your particular instructions. To prevent the rafters from lifting up, use your drill to add the included screws to the underside of the rafter. To find the pre-drilled hole, look on the bottom of the rafter near the tension cable or belly band. Do not use different or longer screws. The screw provided is the correct size for the pre-drilled hole. Each rafter has a slight notch to hold the tension cable or belly band in place against the door. Go inside the yurt, and place the header bracket onto the rafter on top of the door. Rest the flat side on top of the door header. Then, slide it forward so it is flush with the tension cable. Secure the brackets to the rafters using the included screws and your power drill. Before you fasten the header bracket to the door header, make sure the door is straight. To do this, remove the cable clamps from the safety cable, and thread the cable through the pre-drilled holes in the rafters. When you reach the starting point, bring the end of the cable through the loop on the opposite end, and pull it tightly. Reposition the cable clamps and tighten them so they are secure. You can then cut off any extra cable using a cable cutter."

      "A box with suspiciously few images or text blocks on it is likely counterfeit. Most product labels and boxes (or other packaging) have a whole host of information printed on them, from bar codes and trademark and patent information to recycling symbols. Counterfeiters often don't want to spend the time to reproduce every detail, so they'll likely leave some of this stuff off. Also look for manufacturer contact information. Most reputable companies will provide a phone number or at least an address at which consumers can call them. China is the source of most counterfeit products. Of course, many legitimately produced products are also made in China, but a \"Made in China\" sticker on an already suspicious product is a red flag.  You should also be suspicious if no country of origin is listed on either the packaging or the product itself. Counterfeiting rings will sometimes remove a \"Made in China\" sticker when importing fake products, and producers of counterfeits will sometimes simply leave off the country of origin designation. Just about any product that could pose some sort of safety risk will have one or more safety certifications on its label. Some counterfeiters products may omit a safety certification label altogether, while others will often include fake marks on their products.  The UL (Underwriters Laboratory) label is the most common safety certification, particularly in the U.S. (the competing ETL mark is also a major certification in the U.S.). In Europe, the CE (the abbreviation doesn't officially stand for anything) marking is required on electrical products, and in Canada the CSA (Canadian Standards Association) mark is common. Look for at least one of these marks on electrical products. Low-quality products that don't claim to be brand-name may also simply use a counterfeit certification mark. Faked marks are usually, but not always, easy to spot. UL requires hologram marks for most products from China and for some products regardless of country of origin. If the certification mark is present only on the packaging, but not on the product itself, there's a good chance the product is fake.",
      "Reputable businesses typically take great care in packaging their products. Beware flimsy packaging, packaging with substandard printing or running colors, or packages that appear to have been opened. In addition, take a moment to actually read the package. Spelling or grammatical errors are common on the packaging for counterfeit goods. Beware products that seem flimsy or are obviously poorly made. Quality control is often absent in counterfeiting operations, so you may be able to spot a counterfeit simply based on its workmanship. Of course, even if it isn't a counterfeit, you’d still do well to avoid purchasing a poorly-made product. Check for things like:  Items made with flimsy plastic instead of metal. Stickers or decals instead of paint. Poor-quality stitching on clothing goods, handbags, and shoes. Open the box or bag and make sure that the item advertised on the packaging is what's inside. Some careless counterfeiters will try putting a fake drill, for example, in a box for a saw. Unfortunately, errors are rarely this obvious. Check model numbers on the packaging against the model number of the equipment, and carefully examine tags on clothing. Make sure everything that should be inside the product packaging is' there. Counterfeit products often don't include supplementary materials, such an owner's manual or a product registration card. Sometimes they don't even include all the parts that should come with the product, or some parts will be from a different manufacturer.  For example, if you're buying electronics, check to make sure that the packaging includes a power cord, assembly and warranty paperwork, and other relevant small items. Televisions should come with a remote control, and many desktop computers come with a mouse.",
      "Whether you’re shopping in-person or online, you can safely avoid the risk of counterfeit goods by only purchasing from well-known, established retailers. Temporary, unknown, or suspicious businesses are more likely to sell counterfeits—even if they display manufacturer logos on their storefront or website.  For example, while you’re guaranteed to find real Apple products at the Apple store, you may not find the genuine article at a temporary mall kiosk. If you’re not certain if a business is legitimate or not, search for the business name online. Nearly all genuine businesses have a website. Next, look for user reviews: if others are calling the products and goods “fake,” or “a rip-off,” you can be certain they’re counterfeit. When in doubt, avoid a potentially shady business. Not all fakes sell at lower prices than their genuine counterparts, but an unreal bargain is one of the surest signs of a counterfeit product. Ask yourself how someone can sell, for example, a brand new $140 tool for $50. Chances are, it's because the product is a fake. Odds are you purchase many of the same products or brands over and over again. Pay attention to the look and design of similarly-branded products that you already own. This will make you better at spotting a counterfeit, because you'll have something to compare it to. Look for any deviations in the workmanship and in the text on the item, either the copy or the font and text placement. If you're purchasing a brand that is new to you or a product that you don't frequently buy, compare it to the same product at other stores."

      "The first step to dividing the circle is cutting it directly in half. Choose a point anywhere along the circle and draw a line through the center of the circle to the opposite end. The circle is now divided into two equal pieces. This method works well if you are trying to cut a pie or a cake. Next, you want to draw two lines that cut the half into thirds. You can approximate this by dividing one half of the cake into three equal pieces. Get as close to three equal pieces as possible. Again, this method is just an approximation. Continue both of those lines through the center of the circle to the opposite side of the circle. If done correctly, the circle should now be divided into six approximately equal parts. This method is not exact, but is an easy way to divide the circle into six equal parts by eye.",
      "The Ellipse tool is part of the toolbar on the left side of the screen. It is a shaded ellipse. Hold down ⇧ Shift and click on the white canvas, and drag the circle to the size that you want. Release the click on the mouse and then release ⇧ Shift to make a perfect circle. To place a vertical guide, click on the vertical ruler and drag right towards the circle. Place the guide over the vertical center points of the circle. To place the horizontal guide, click on the horizontal ruler and drag down toward the circle. If the guides don’t get properly placed the first time, you can click on them again and drag them into place. The Polygon Frame tool is located in the left toolbar underneath the Rectangle Frame tool group. Click and hold on the Rectangle Frame tool to reveal the icons underneath. The tool looks like a hexagon with an “X” through it.  Click on the Polygon Frame tool to make it active. It will now be the icon showing on the toolbar. With the Polygon Frame tool selected, click onto the white canvas to open the options dialog box. Set the number of sides to 3 and click okay. With ⇧ Shift held down, click and drag a triangle that is slightly longer than the radius of your circle. Don’t release ⇧ Shift until after you let go of the mouse click. This will ensure that you have made a perfect equilateral triangle. Make sure the black arrow is selected on toolbar and click on the triangle. Drag it to the center of the circle so that the bottom-left corner snaps to the center of the circle. The right side of the triangle should hang outside the circle with the bottom and left side of the triangle intersecting the circle. Highlight both the triangle and the circle. With both highlighted, find the Intersect tool nested under Object>Pathfinder. After clicking Intersect, the circle should disappear and a wedge shape should appear. This wedge is one-sixth of the circle. Highlight the wedge and right click. Click on Transform>Rotate. Set the angle to 60° and click Copy. Once you click copy, a second wedge, rotated 60° from the original wedge, will appear. Align this second wedge next to the first wedge. You will start to see the circle forming.

      "Align the pencil tip with the tip of the needle. Place the point of the compass down on the paper. Set the distance between the pencil and needle equal to the radius of the circle that you would like and draw. Swing the compass around 360° to complete the circle.  Make sure the hinge is tight so it doesn’t slip while drawing. Also make sure the pencil is securely in its holder so it also doesn’t move while drawing. This first circle is the main circle that you will be dividing. Place the needle of the compass at any point along the edge of the main circle. Keep the distance between the needle and pencil the same as the first circle. Swing the compass around to complete the second circle.  The second circle should overlap with the first circle and the edge should cross through the center of the first circle. If the distance between the needle and the pencil changes at all, the circle will not be divided equally. Place the needle at the intersection of the first and second circle. There are two intersections and you can use either one; this will be the center of a third circle. Use the compass to complete the third circle.  Again, keep the compass at the same distance for every circle you draw. At this point you should have three overlapping circles. You should notice that the two outer circles overlap with the center of the first main circle. Just as you did to draw the second and third circle, use the intersection of the third circle with the main circle as the center point. Remember, going clockwise around the circle, you will use the intersection to the left of the circle. Place the compass on that intersection and draw a fourth circle. You are halfway done with drawing circles. Using the intersection of the previously drawn circle with the main circle as the center, draw the next circle. Continue the next three circles until you have a total of six circles all around the main circle. The inside of your original circle should now look like a 6 petaled flower. This is the first of three lines you will need to draw to divide the circle into 6 parts. Every line, including this one, should cross the exact center of the circle and divide two of the six inner \"flower petals\" of your drawing in half. This line will bisect two opposite flower petals and will go through the exact center of the circle. You now have a circle divided into 6 equal parts."

The Quest Log can be found at the bottom right-hand side of your screen (the exclamation point icon). A window will appear showing a list of on-going and available quests.  When you open your Quest Log, make sure you're in a city or town to avoid being attacked by monsters. The Quest Log can also be opened by pressing Q on your keyboard.  Head straight to the Underground Waterway, under Very Hard mode, and kill 7 Mickey the Mice.  This can be done in a party. If your party member kills a Mickey, that too will be counted. To get in a dungeon, simply press the Dungeon tab found on your screen. This will open a window showing you the available dungeons for your level. Click on the dungeon you want to enter and then press Start Dungeon, or hit F8 on your keyboard. This will automatically assign you to a party, but if you're already in a party, choose “Start with current members” instead. To change the dungeon difficulty, after choosing a dungeon you want to enter, look at the menu to your right; you will see the description of the dungeon as well as the dungeon difficulty. Choose from Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. Keep in mind that the higher the difficulty you choose, the more stamina is consumed per run, and this also requires a full party to clear the dungeon, depending on the dungeon level. After completing your first quest, go and clear the Suburbs of Wally's Castle. Complete the dungeon on any mode. He's the village's Equipment NPC; he can be found at the top right of the map. Talk to him about the quest, and he will give you a third test. You can invite your friends for a party raid or join randomly with other players. After completing this quest, open your Quest Log to complete your Ranger quest and become a full-fledge Ranger.",
      "This is the easiest of Rena's new combos, and the most used during PvP. By pressing X repeatedly, Rena will attack using her bow and arrows, causing the enemy to flinch and cancel any of their incoming attacks. At the fourth X, the Sniping Ranger will automatically use  Siege Mode, which gives your character a higher boost in range and damage (X, X, X, X). This combo also available during your basic class, but once you have advanced to Sniping Ranger, your character can now execute this combo twice. Press Up twice to double-jump in air, press X twice to shoot down arrows, hitting enemies that are below you (Up, Up, X, X). Sniping Rangers can be vulnerable when close to enemies, but with Triple Arrow, she can dash past the enemy then shoot arrows from behind them.  Many of the players use this skill to repeatedly cause the enemy to flinch at the first two attacks then knock them down at third. To do this combo, press the arrow button twice to run toward your enemy and then hit X three times (<< or >>, X, X, X).",
      "Now that you have completed the first leg of the quest, look for the NPC named Lenphad in Elder Village. Lenphad is the Equipment NPC for this map and can be found at the top-right level of the village, just next to Echo the Alchemist. Talk to him regarding the class-advancement quest, and he will give you a set of tasks to complete. The advancement quest for Sniping Ranger has three parts but all can be done in Wally's Castle.  If you haven't unlock Wally's Castle yet, make sure you complete the Suburbs of Wally's Castle first in order for this map to be available in your dungeon selection. You must clear this dungeon with a rank B or higher; otherwise, you will have to do reruns. There is no time limit for this. They can be found on any floor of the dungeon, so make sure you have explored the entire area.  Don't forget to collect High Quality Lubricants from the Crossbow Soldiers (you will need 2), as these are quest items. If you ever got disconnected from the game while you're in the dungeon, the monster kill, including the number of quest item you collected will remain. However, your stamina will still be deducted. Mini bosses will be available in this map; killing them will give you a chance of obtaining rare items, which can be useful for your survival. Once you have completed the quest, return to the Elder Village and open your Quest Log by pressing Q. Click the first-class advancement quest and then press Complete. This will complete the quest for the class change and will automatically turn your Rena to Sniping Ranger. If ever your character didn't change \\to Sniping Ranger after completing the quest, simply log off from the game and then log in again.

      "Set the oven to bake or convection and allow it to begin warming up as you get the rest of your ingredients together. Hake is a delicate fish that doesn’t take long to cook through, so it’s best to use a moderate temperature to prevent it from getting too done. Baking hake highlights the fish’s natural flavor without contributing unnecessary calories. Make sure the skin side is facing down so that the meat is visible. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the fillets to keep them from sticking.The foil will trap in moisture, preventing the hake from drying out in the heat of the oven.  Make sure the foil you're using can go in the oven safely. Leave the top of the foil open for now in case you decide to thrown in a few herbs, spices, or vegetables for steaming. Sprinkle the hake with kosher salt, black pepper, lemon zest, or other spices to taste. If you want, you can also add pungent vegetables or herbs to each packet. The fish will absorb the flavors of the other components as it cooks, giving a little more depth. Onions, garlic, capers, and herbs like parsley and dill are all popular companions for baked hake. Once you’ve seasoned the hake, seal up each of the packet to ensure that they'll hold in heat. Enclosing the fillets in foil will also keep any liquid from leaking out while they're baking, which means juicier fish and faster cleanup. Avoid wrapping the fish too tight. This could mash it and ruin its natural texture. Leave 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of space between them for the heat to circulate. You should be able to fit at least half a dozen average-sized fillets on a single baking sheet. If you're preparing enough for a crowd, you might need to pull out a second sheet or do your baking in batches. If you're worried about the foil sticking, brush the surface of the baking sheet with a light coating of oil before laying out the packets. Slide the baking sheet onto the center rack. Then, set a timer to remind you to check the fish’s progress after the first 10 minutes. If the fillets look like they need a little more time, pop them back into the oven for 2-3 minutes.  When properly cooked, the meat should be white and flaky, and give way easily under a fork. Be careful not to overcook the hake. Since it has such a light consistency, it can go from done to overdone in a matter of minutes. Plate the fillets alongside a mound of rice pilaf or quinoa and a colorful tossed salad. For a heartier meal, try pairing the fish with steamed seasonal veggies, red potato salad, or corn on the cob. Garnish with a lemon wedge or sprig of parsley and enjoy!  Make condiments like tartar sauce or lemon butter available for diners who prefer to dress up their fish.  Put away your leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator. When properly stored, cooked fish should last 3-4 days.",
      "Run 7 ounces of water (about 200 ml) into the saucepan, then top it off with a splash of broth or stock. Make sure you use enough liquid to completely cover the fillets. Add your choice of aromatics, such as lemon slices, whole peppercorns, bay leaves, and allspice.  For a tangier poaching liquid, you can also use white wine in place of the broth or stock. Traditionally, a mixture of diced onion, carrots, and celery known as “mirepoix” is also incorporated into the poaching liquid. These ingredients can be useful for infusing your hake with a subtle savory flavor. Place the saucepan on the cooktop over medium-high heat until it just begins to bubble. Allow the mixture to simmer for 2-3 minutes. This will give the various flavors a chance to mingle.  For best results, your poaching liquid should reach a temperature between 160–180 °F (71–82 °C) before you add the hake.  Be careful not to let the liquid come to a full boil. High heat can cause the tender fish to disintegrate. Lower the fillets carefully to prevent splashing. They should lie flat against the cooking surface and be completely submerged. If you haven’t used quite enough liquid, pour in additional water, wine, broth or stock until the fillets are covered. If you run out of room in the pan, it may be necessary to cook the fish in batches. The hot poaching liquid will quickly cook the hake through without drying it out. Keep an eye on the fillets in the meantime. When the meat turns opaque and takes on a plump, juicy appearance, they’re ready to come out.  Avoid stirring the fillets as they’re poaching. Handling them too much could cause them to fall apart. Poaching is one of the fastest ways to prepare lighter types of fish like hake. Remove the fillets from the saucepan using a slotted spoon to strain the excess liquid. Place the fillets on a layer of folded paper towels to soak up any remaining moisture, then transfer them to individual plates for serving. Poached hake goes particularly well with bright, mild vegetables like tomatoes, mushrooms, and zucchini.  Some buttery dinner rolls or a loaf of crusty, fresh-baked bread can help balance out the moistness of the fish nicely. Poach fish is best enjoyed fresh. However, any uneaten portions should keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator when stored along with the remaining poaching liquid.",
      "Place the skillet on the cooktop over medium heat and drizzle in just enough oil to cover the bottom. You’ll know it’s reached the right temperature when it begins to shimmer and smoke faintly. Oils with high smoke points, such as olive, canola, or vegetable oil, tend to be best for pan frying. The fish will begin sizzling as soon as it comes into contact with the hot oil, so be sure to release it as close to the pan as possible to safeguard yourself from pops and splatters. Situate the fillets roughly half an inch (2.7 cm) apart to prevent crowding or sticking.  You may only be able to fit 1-2 fillets in the skillet at a time, depending on the size of the fish and your cookware. A pair of tongs can come in handy if you’re worried about being burned. This should be just enough time to get the exterior nice and crispy. Allow the fish to cook until the meat just above the skin begins to turn white. Hake is typically eaten with the skin on, similar to heartier fish like salmon or bass. Slide your spatula under the fillets and give them a flip. Press the spatula firmly against the top of each fillet for a moment until you feel it relax. This will help the underside sear evenly and loosen up the meat for a more tender bite.  Make sure you separate the skin from the pan prior to turning. Otherwise, it can easily stick and lead to breaking and tearing. Always use a spatula to flip fish rather than tongs. Not only is it easier, it also makes you less likely to mangle your main course in the process, improving its presentation. The hake should only require another minute or so to finish cooking after being turned. Use the edge of your spatula to cut partway into a piece to see how it’s coming along. The interior should be white and flaky, with a light browning on both sides.  The fillets will be very hot when they first come out of the pan. It’s a good idea to give them a minute or two to cool down before you begin eating. Whip up some crowd-pleasers like garlic mashed potatoes or sautéed spinach to round out the meal. For a lighter touch, slice a couple tomatoes or a put together a root vegetable medley instead. Pull up a chair and help yourself while it’s hot!  Rich cream sauces can make an excellent compliment to the crisp, golden-brown fillets. Stash your leftovers in the refrigerator and try to consume them within 3-4 days. Reheat the fried fish under the broiler in your oven or in a pan with fresh oil to preserve its tender texture and prevent it from becoming soggy."

    ],
    "document": [
      "If you are experiencing heartburn, belching, difficulty swallowing, or chest pain that you think might be caused by a hiatal hernia, ask your doctor to run some tests. To confirm that these symptoms are from a hiatal hernia and not just acid reflux (GERD), your doctor will need to see your stomach. He or she may perform an esophagram, which is a procedure where you drink a chalky liquid containing barium that coats your upper digestive tract. You will then be given an X-ray, which will, because of the barium, provide a clear outline of your esophagus and stomach. If a hiatal hernia is present, bulging may be seen around the esophagus stomach junction. Your doctor may also order an endoscopy. During this exam, a thin flexible tube with a light and video camera, called an endoscope, is slid down your throat and into your esophagus and stomach. This tool checks for obvious structural changes or visible signs of tissue inflammation that may provide evidence of an existing hiatal hernia. To test for complications that arise from a hiatal hernia, your doctor may run a blood test. Acid reflux and symptomatic hiatal hernias can lead to bleeding if the tissue is inflamed or irritated as well as lead to blood vessel rupture. Too much bleeding can lead to anemia and low red blood cells. Your doctor may take a small amount of your blood and send it out to a lab to detect if you have low red blood cells.",
      "Since hiatal hernias cause acid reflux symptoms, the first method of treatment is to prevent reflux, reduce acid production, and increase esophagus clearance. This can be done by reducing risk factors and implementing lifestyle changes. Smoking can make your hiatal hernia symptoms worse. Studies have shown that smoking tobacco relaxes this sphincter, a band of muscles around where the esophagus meets the stomach. The sphincter squeezes to prevent stomach contents from coming back up.   Quitting smoking can be challenging. Speak with family, friends, and your doctor if you are seriously considering it. They can motivate and guide you to treatment options such as medications, nicotine patch, nicotine gum, and other healthy choices. Certain types of foods can lead to stomach irritation and increased acid production. In order to prevent and control your symptoms, avoid or limit foods such as:  Chocolate Onions and garlic Spicy foods Fatty foods such as fried foods Citrus foods such as oranges Tomato based foods Alcohol Peppermint or spearmint Carbonated beverages like sodas Dairy products, such as milk and ice cream Coffee In addition to avoiding certain foods, there are foods you can eat which may help you prevent further symptoms from your hiatal hernia. Try to include healthier options for your stomach to handle, such as lean meats like skinless chicken, red meat with little visible fat, ground turkey instead of ground beef, and fish. Lean beef cuts include round, chuck, sirloin, or loin. Lean pork cuts include tenderloin or loin chop. You can also improve your diet by:  Baking or broil foods instead of frying. Skimming off fat from meat during cooking. Trying not to use too much spicy seasoning. Eating low-fat dairy foods, such as low-fat yogurt instead of ice cream. Steaming your vegetables with water instead of broth. Limiting butter, oils, and cream sauces. Use cooking spray instead of cooking oil when sautéing. Choosing low-fat or nonfat ingredients over full-fat products. There are other food-related concerns that need to be considered when you are dealing with a hiatal hernia. When purchasing food items, always check the content or ingredient lists. If you are unsure if other food products may be triggering symptoms, take note before eating them and compare to it to how you feel after eating them. Also try eating smaller meals throughout the day rather than large meals. This gives your stomach an easier time to digest and produces less acid than larger meals. Do not eat too quickly either as this may give a similar effect. Increased abdominal pressure can put more pressure on the sphincter, leading to acid reflux or hernias. To reduce pressure on your stomach, try not to strain when passing stool. If you do strain or feel more constipated, add more fiber based foods to your diet such as fruits and grains. Try not to lift heavy objects because this puts pressure on your stomach and can aggravate symptoms or cause a hernia. Avoid lying down on your back or side after you eat. Think of it as tipping over a glass of water — if you are flat and the sphincter isn't functioning the stomach contents will easily enter into the esophagus causing symptoms. Being upright will help to minimize the risk. If you are overweight or obese, this can cause problems related to your hiatal hernia. Studies have shown that excessive body weight is a risk factor for hiatal hernias. Try walking for about 30 min after meals to help you digest and possibly lose more weight. A study has shown that walking for 30 min after eating reduced weight over a month when compared to walking after waiting an hour after meals  As you go along, gradually increase your workouts. Perform more cardio based workouts such as running, jogging, jumping jacks, and biking, to help you burn more fat and calories. If you do this in addition to changing your diet to help your hernia, you are more likely to lose weight.",
      "You should not start medicating you have been assessed and properly diagnosed by a physician. Once your doctor has confirmed your diagnosis, she may suggest some different medications that you can take to help with the symptoms of a hiatal hernia. Be aware that these medications will not treat the hernia itself; rather, they will treat the GERD symptoms caused by your hernia. Antacids such as Rolaids, tums, Mylanta, and Maalox can be used before, during, or after meals to neutralize stomach acid. They come in many forms such as tablets, chewables, and liquids. You can also take H-2 blockers such as Zantac and Pepcid, which block receptors in your stomach to reduce acid production. It takes 30 to 90 minutes for the medications to take effect and it is advised to be taken before the first meal of the day. These can last up to 24 hours.  Proton pump inhibitors like Nexium and Prilosec work similarly to H2 blockers by blocking glands that produce acid in the stomach. Take 30 min before your first meal of the day.  All of these medications can be bought over the counter without a prescription. No matter the medication, always follow directions as labeled. There are some fairly significant illnesses on the differential diagnosis list that have very similar symptoms to a hiatal hernia, such as esophagitis, an esophageal motility disorder, and coronary artery disease. You need to see your doctor to rule these out before attempting treatment, even with over-the-counter products. 95% of hiatial hernias are Type 1 or sliding and these do not require surgery. 5% are other types of hiatial hernias called \"paraesophageal.\" Patients with paraesophageal hernias who are symptomatic are recommended to have surgical repair. A paraesophageal hernia may lead to severe symptoms requiring emergent attention, such as a blockage of the passage of food, strangulation (blood supply becoming cut off to herniated tissue), perforation, and respiratory compromise. When all else fails, surgery is presented as an option. The surgeon will attempt to reduce the contents of the hernia, mobilize the esophagus, close the hiatal defect, reduce esophageal reflux and fixate the stomach. To treat a hiatal hernia, there are three types of surgeries that you may need. One type is a Nissen fundoplication, a procedure that involves a 360 degree wrap around of the stomach esophagus junction. The hiatus where the esophagus passes through is also repaired. You may also have a Belsey fundoplication, which is an operation that involves a 270 degree wrap in an attempt to reduce the incidence of gas bloating and trouble swallowing.  You may also have a Hill repair, which is a procedure where the top part of the stomach, before it becomes the esophagus, is anchored to the back of the abdomen, strengthening the anti-reflux mechanism. Some surgeons then tack the stomach down in the abdomen to prevent it from migrating upwards again.  The choice depends on the surgeon's familiarity and comfort with each procedure. The most common type of surgical approach is laparoscopic. The surgeon uses an inserted camera probe to visualize the area and another probe to perform the surgery. This approach, as opposed to the open stomach surgery, leads to less scarring, better outcomes, and quicker recovery. Your surgeon will make three to five small cuts in your belly. A thin tube with a tiny camera, called a laparoscope, on the end is inserted through one of these cuts, while other surgical tools are inserted in the others.  The laparoscope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. Your surgeon does the repair while viewing the inside of your belly on the monitor. The surgery is done while you are under general anesthesia, so you are asleep and pain-free. Surgery usually takes two to three hours."

      "Gerberas must be in a pot with at least one drainage hole to avoid root rot, crown rot, and powdery mildew which occur when the soil is constantly wet and the plant is sitting in water. However, having even more holes on the bottom will be even better. It's best to have fresh, high-quality potting soil.  Fill the container with about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the soil. Put in the plant and add more soil until the crown (where the stem meets the roots) is slightly above the soil. Don't cover the crown, or your daisy is likely to suffocate. Modern soils allow water to flow out of the drainage holes rather than be retained at the roots. This is necessary so that your plant doesn't experience root rot or other diseases. Near a sunny window, there's adequate sunlight, but the temperatures may be too high and end up burning the leaves. However, without enough sunlight, you'll have plenty of leaves but no blooms. Morning sunlight is ideal, but be sure to keep you gerbera out of bright light during the afternoon. They can tolerate cool temperatures, but find it hard to survive in temperatures higher than 70 °F (21 °C). If your plant is located in indirect light, make sure it gets it the whole day. Turn on overhead lights or other lamps nearby, particularly during the winter. If the soil is still moist, leave the plant for a day or two. Thoroughly soak the roots of the plant, but keep the leaves as dry as possible. Make sure the pot is thoroughly drained before putting it back on a saucer or drip tray. Otherwise, the plant's roots may rot in the soggy soil. During the winter months, you should water it less often, but avoid letting the soil dry out completely. For indoor plants, it's best to use a fertilizer that is formulated for blooming parts. Follow the instructions on the package as to how much fertilizer to use based on the size of your container. Fertilize your daisy during the growing season (mid-spring to early summer), but avoid doing so otherwise. As the flowers start to wilt and fade, pinch or cut off the stem just next to the flower. Do this with all the dead or dying flowers on the gerbera. This is also referred to as deadheading the plant and will focus the development of the plant into growing more beautiful blossoms rather than producing seeds. It maintains the plant's appearance while also potentially allowing the second bunch of flowers to come out.  Bugs may pester your gerbera if you do not deadhead it. Start doing this early, such as around late spring, and repeat the process every couple of days to keep your plant in the best shape possible. If you'd like to keep flowers in a vase, cut them off when they're still fresh and keep them in water. They should last for several days. Once the plant begins looking crowded in its pot, it will need to have more space. Pick a pot that's a size larger than your current one with at least one (preferably more) drainage hole at the bottom. Fill it with 3 inches of potting soil. Hold the stem with your fingers while also covering the top of the pot and turn it upside down. The plant along with some soil should slide out, but if it doesn't, you can knock the pot against another surface to turn the plant loose. Transfer the plant to the larger pot and add soil until the top of the roots sit an inch lower than the rim of the pot. Water your replanted gerbera daisy until it begins dripping from the drainage hole(s).  When you take the daisy out, you can examine the roots. Trim off any that appear diseased or rotten. Don't cover the crown (where the main stem meets the roots) when adding soil. The plant might wilt slightly following the repot, but will perk up again within a week or two with proper care. Although gerberas don't survive repotting very well because they have deep root systems, suffocating them in a small pot will not help either. Gerberas may be infested by common household pests like mites or aphids. Spray your plant with an insecticidal soap according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monitor your plants carefully so that you can tackle the problem before they take over and the problem gets severe. You may use an organic insecticidal soap if you wish.",
      "It should get direct sunlight in the morning and be shaded in the afternoon. Although they prefer bright sunlight, it's best to keep them out of intense light, especially in hot climates. Move them outside only when all risks of spring frosts are gone. Spade the soil to a depth of 8–10 inches (20–25 cm) and add a layer of organic matter like manure or compost. Leave a space of 18–24 inches (46–61 cm) between each plant if you have multiple. Make sure that the crown of the plant (or where the stem meets the roots) is just above ground level so that your gerbera doesn't suffocate. You can also water when the top of the soil and the crown (the place where the stem meets the roots) of the plant are dry. Do this only in the morning so that the leaves get a chance to dry during the day to reduce problems with fungal diseases and rot. It's recommended to water deeply with a soaker hose or a regular hose with a light trickle. That way, you can avoid getting the leaves wet at all. Make sure to thoroughly soak the roots of your gerbera. This will promote growth and add extra nutrients. Use a balanced general-purpose garden fertilizer. You may also apply a time-release fertilizer every 2-6 weeks.   A high-quality micronutrient-rich liquid fertilizer is also recommended. Gerberas often need extra iron or magnesium to continually bloom. Try to find a fertilizer that contains at least one of these minerals. Leave some space between the material and the plant's crown. This will boost the plant's growth and encourage flowering. Remove wilted blooms by pinching or cutting off the stem just below the flower. Repeat with all the fading flowers to help your gerbera maintain it's attractiveness and channel energy into the second set of luscious blossoms.  If you'd like to keep flowers in a vase, cut them off when they're still fresh and keep them in water. They should last for several days. Start doing this early, such as around late spring, and repeat the process every couple of days to keep your plant in the best shape possible. Weather and irrigation will cause the crown to sink beneath the surface of the soil. Dig carefully using a garden fork and avoid damaging the roots."

      "Look for colleges that offer writing degrees in screenwriting, film and television, or cinema and media production. TV writing is a specific type of writing and majoring in English or creative writing may be too broad. Be specific when choosing a writing program and make sure it includes classes specific to television production.  Film classes will help you understand characters, plot, and what translates well from the page to the screen. These classes will also give you an understanding of how films are made. Theater classes will give you an in depth look at working with actors on a script. These classes often require you to work with others and teach you how to work within a team. This will help prepare you for the larger project of TV writing. Television writing and production classes will be some of the most beneficial you can take. These classes will cover how to create scripts, what to expect in your job search, and career options. You do not have to seek a degree to take these classes. Classes are offered online or in person, depending on where you are. Look in your area for TV writing classes sponsored by colleges, writing groups, or media companies. If you live in an area without access to in person classes, online classes are just as beneficial. Either option will allow you to meet new people who share your interest and make connections for the future. Reference books will help you understand formatting as well as the creative aspect of TV writing. The Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier or Crafty TV: Thinking Inside the Box by Alex Epstein are good books to start with. TV scripts are not formatted the same way as books or essays so researching is essential. Watch current TV shows with the purpose of educating yourself. Ask yourself what in the writing makes the show work.  How does the dialogue convey (or not) what the characters are trying to communicate? What role does non-verbal communication play in the show? How is the plot moving forward in this specific show as well as the rest of the season? How does the writing convey character development? Use the Internet to find out who writes the shows you enjoy and research them. Watch or read interviews with screenwriters to find out how their career began and grew.  If comedy is an area that interests you, Carol Leifer has written for Saturday Night Live, Seinfeld, and Devious Maids among other shows. She describes her experiences in her memoirs How to Succeed in Business Without Really Crying: Lessons From A Life in Comedy as well as in numerous interviews.   If you are a fan of Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, or How to Get Away With Murder, Shonda Rhimes has given several interviews discussing her career. She discusses her transition from film to television and often has advice for aspiring writers.",
      "Writing for a show and characters you are connected to will come across as more authentic than writing for a show just because it is popular. Do not write an original show idea. Show executives want to know if you can write in a preexisting world without drastically changing the show's dynamic or losing your unique voice. An established show is better than a brand new one since it will likely still be on the air when your script is ready to send out. This is not the time to drastically change the path of the show or showcase your new ideas. Stay true to the characters and storyline to prove that you can work within the established world of the show.  Think about the storyline the show revolves around. If it is a mystery, do not solve the mystery in your episode. Similarly do not write an episode in which two characters finally become a couple if the show revolves around their romantic tension. It is also best to not kill off any characters in your spec script. Do not revisit or rewrite the show's history. You should keep your script within the confines of present day for the show. Your script should be free of flashbacks and mythology. Edit your script, then edit it again. Watch the TV show you are writing an episode for and then go back to your script to make sure the writing stays true to the show. Is the dialogue believable for the show? Are your stage directions realistic within the confines of the series? Family and friends are not ideal as they are often too close to you to be honest. Look for writer's groups, either online or in person, to exchange ideas and editing services with. These groups will help you hone your craft. They will also help you learn to accept rejection gracefully. You will need at least two speculative (spec) scripts to break into the entertainment writing business. For television this will be two episodic screenplays of a TV show. This is how you will show executives and showrunners your writing ability and it is essentially your resume. You also want to make sure you have one ready to send in immediately if it is requested.",
      "An agent can help get your script into the right hands. Agents will list on their website specific instructions on how to submit your writing. The Writer's Guild of America is a reputable resource for finding agencies.  Almost all agents will require a query letter. This is a letter in which you sell your writing and yourself to the agent. Some require a specific format so check their website. All are looking for something that stands out so make sure your letter highlights the best parts of you and your writing. An agent shouldn't charge upfront to represent you. Most agents' fees are 10-12 percent after they broker your deal. If an agent asks you to pay a fee just for representation, move on to another agency. You can look up information online about how to submit your script to them as they have specific, individual instructions. Many do not accept scripts, depending on legal issues with their current shows. The ones that will accept them usually have instructions on their company site for submitting episode manuscripts. Becoming a writer's or producer's assistant is an excellent way to get your foot in the door of TV writing. You will not make much money, but you will be exposed to a TV show from the off camera point of view. This will allow you to read scripts, see how writers and producers work in real time, and make numerous connections within the industry. Check out the job opportunities section on the home page of the production company you are interested in joining. Search online for workshops, conventions, or meet and greets in your field. Join media groups online and follow them on social media. The more connections you make, the better your chance of getting a foot in the door."

However, even if you only withdrew $10, the minimum dollar amount for a charge might be $5, making the charge for the $10 withdrawal $5 instead of $1. The interest rates on cash advances are almost always higher than the interest rates on a typical credit transaction. Before you decide to make a cash withdrawal, make sure you know the interest rate and can afford it. It isn’t uncommon to see interest rates of 20% and more for cash advances, which is extraordinary. Many a sensible person has become financially ensnared by a high interest rate. Make sure you’ll be able to easily pay the cash advance back before you make the withdrawal. Unlike most credit card transactions, the interest on cash advances begins to accrue immediately. While it’s always important to pay off your credit card balance as quickly as possible, this goes double for a cash advance. You will need to pay the minimum payment on your regular credit card balance before any payment can go toward paying off your cash advance. Any additional payment will then go to the highest interest rate balance on your card. So if the interest rate on your regular credit card balance is 4% and the interest rate on your cash advance is 20%, the payment must be applied to paying off the cash advance balance. A lot of people will have other alternatives to a credit card cash advance—probably the only type of loan more unfriendly to the borrower than a cash advance is a payday loan. You should consider any of the following before you take a cash advance:  Getting a personal loan. It will take a little longer than a credit card cash advance, but the interest rate will be much lower than a cash advance (by as much as half). Furthermore, you can usually get a personal loan for a larger amount. Personal loans are available through banks and credit unions. Applying for a HELOC. A Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a line of credit in the same amount as the equity in your home. It is like a second mortgage, but you aren’t obligated for all of the equity in your home, and it has an expiration date. They’ll take much longer to apply for than a cash advance, but they’ll be far less expensive. ref>http://ptmoney.com/credit-card-cash-advance-bad-financial-move-or-good-emergency-plan/</ref> Interest paid on a HELOC is deductible from income tax.",
      "While most credit cards allow cash advances, it doesn’t work exactly like using a credit card. Where you might be able to use a credit card even if you’re a little late on the payment, this is generally not the case with a cash advance.  You typically can’t withdraw the entire amount of your credit limit, either, so you’ll need to make sure you’re not maxed out before you try to make a withdrawal. If you use online banking, you should be able to access this information quickly by logging into your account. If you don’t use online banking and you aren’t sure about whether you’re current on payments or how much you have left on your credit limit, you should call the creditor who issued the card. They’ll be able to answer any question  you might have about your credit limit or payment history. Don’t forget to ask about any fees or special interest rates for cash advances. Before you go to the ATM, remember that your credit card has a different PIN than does your debit card. You’ll need to get the PIN for your credit card before you go to the ATM, because it’s common for an ATM to freeze an account after a certain number of wrong entries. If you can’t remember your PIN, you may be able to reset it. Call your bank and inquire about how to change it. Sometimes it’s as easy as calling a 1-800 number, but other banks might send you the new PIN in the mail. Although you can get a cash advance from a bank or in the form of a check delivered by postal mail, the speed and convenience of an ATM withdrawal is part of the appeal. Try and find an ATM from the same bank as issued the card—using it will be free. If you can’t find an ATM from the issuing bank, try an Allpoint ATM. Allpoint is a network of over 50,000 surcharge-free ATMs. Unfortunately, everyone isn’t in the Allpoint network. Check to see if you are at http://www.allpointnetwork.com/."

      "\" Love is a beautiful, joyous emotion. But it is also a powerful word, and you shouldn't throw it around with your man unless you're sure you mean it. This doesn't mean you need to write a thesis on your feelings. But you do need to ask yourself what you hope to gain by telling him you love him.  If he's already said \"I love you,\" and you know you feel the same, feel free to come out and say it. If your relationship is strong, and you know him and yourself well, it might be time to say \"I love you.\" If you're convinced you're in love, and need to tell him so, then trust your instincts and say it. If you want to tell him just to see if he'll say \"I love you\" back, or because you feel pressured to say it, don't. Love is something you give to others, it doesn't expect or need someone else's response.  If you're just friends, but want more, you should consider asking him out before saying you love him. Make sure you can spend quality time together before launching an L-bomb. This will also give you a great chance to gauge his own feelings towards you. More likely than not, if you love him then he will feel some attraction back towards you. Just focus on letting go and having fun -- love is not about forcing your feelings -- so take your time and build a relationship.  At the end of the day, this is about you confidently telling him how you feel. If you're not sure if he likes you back, that is okay! That's why you want to tell him your own feelings. Is he comfortable hanging out with just you? If not, telling him you're \"in love\" might come off a little too strongly. Sometimes you just need some perspective. A big reason many people won't say \"I love you\" is that they're afraid the partner doesn't feel the same way. At the end of the day, it comes down to speaking your mind and feelings honestly. However, if you're a little worried:  Ask a mutual, trusted friend if they can see you two dating. Talk to one of his friends and see if he is interested in anyone right now. If you're feeling bold, ask if he has any feelings for you. Even best friends can be taken aback by the powerful words \"I love you.\" You might have thought about this love for months, but for him this is big, sudden news. Imagine yourself in a similar situation -- you have a friend you like who suddenly tells you they are in love. You'd be at a loss for words, to say the least. So don't jump right to love -- take your time exploring your feelings together. Test the water a few weeks in advance with:  \"I just wanted to tell you that I really like you.\" \"I love spending time with you. This has been a great few months.\" \"Let's go on a few dates, just you and me for a change.\" Love: the most blissfully confusing human emotion around. If you feel overwhelmed with affection, feel your stomach flip every time you see him, and want to blurt out \"I love you!\" at every turn, chances are good you're head over heels in love. But, as strong as the feeling is, avoid the temptation to immediately tell anyone. Instead, sit back and enjoy the rush of love for a few days. Show yourself that this isn't just a crush, this is the real thing. If you still feel like you love him, then get ready to make your move. If you don't still feel attached to him after the a few days, then you had a crush, not love. Love stays around for a long while. It is scientifically proven then men say \"I love you\" first more often than women. To make matters worse, many dating books are hard-set on the woman always saying \"I love you\" second. The reasons are fuzzy (\"evolutionary advantage for men who create commitment early on\") or made up (\"women who say it first seem overly needy\"), but there is something to be said for tradition. Like it or not, some men are weirded out when a woman says \"I love you\" first. This shouldn't keep you from expressing your feelings, but it is worth considering.",
      "If your guy is stressed out over work or school, dealing with family issues, or preoccupied with a personal crisis, he probably won't be all that receptive to a big new development in your relationship. There is no \"perfect moment,\" so don't wait for one. A low-key, quiet moment without stress is always a good opportunity. There are, however, bad times to talk about love:  After sex. While intoxicated. Over text or the phone. During or after a fight or argument. Is there a special place that brings up strong memories for the both of you? You may want to tell him at the place where you had your first date, or where you went out to dinner for your two-month or six-month anniversary. That said, all that really matters is that you have a place to talk without being interrupted constantly.  Ask him to go for a walk with you, help with a basic chore, or simply \"come over to talk with me for a few minutes.\" You don't have to plan to be at a cheesy \"rom-com\" setting like an ocean cliff, but it shouldn't be in a dirty alleyway either. Don't try a big gesture or romantic setting -- this isn't the time and chances are good it will backfire. What matters are you and your feelings. So don't overthink things. Speak from the heart and have an open conversation, not some big production. Just start talking honestly about your relationship -- how happy he makes you, good memories you've shared, your own feelings -- to bring up the topic of love organically. Eventually, the only thing left to do is just come out and say it. So close your eyes, count to three, and let it out. Say it any way you feel comfortable, since the words themselves are what really matter. Make eye contact, smile bravely, and be the astounding, honest, and loving person you already are. Remember-- simpler is sweeter. If you're shy and unsure what to do, try out these methods:  \"I'm in love with you.\" \"Joe, I want you to know that these past eight months have been some of the happiest of my life. I feel like we've connected on a deep level and every day we spend together is better than the last. I love you.\" \"I've had something on my chest for a while, and it feels good to let it out. I love you.\" Lean in, and kiss him on the cheek, then whisper in his ear quickly, \"I love you.\" If you can't meet in person, but still need to get your feelings off of your chest, there is nothing decreeing that you can't say \"I love you\" anyway. The reason face-to-face is nicer is that it is much more personal -- but you can make long-distance conversations personal. Instead of a text message, or signing off with an ambiguous \"I love you,\" take the time to write a letter or email that has the only purpose of expressing your love. It doesn't have to be long, just from the heart.  Let them know that you'd rather talk to them in person, but couldn't keep your feelings secret any longer. Elaborate a bit on a story, event, or emotion that lead you to your feelings of love. Let him know that you don't need an immediate response; you just wanted to let him know how you felt.",
      "You can pause, smile, and start talking about something else, indicate that the moment is over by saying “Just thought you should know.\" You can even tell him you don't need to hear anything back, letting him know he should take some time to think things over. The less you come across like you're trying to extract a particular response from him the likelier he'll be to give you the one you want – if not immediately, eventually, when he realizes what a lucky guy he is. When talking, try to phrase everything personally -- \"I realized I love you,\" \"I fell for you, etc.-- instead of using language like \"we\" and \"us.\" Because guys aren't always encouraged to communicate their thoughts and feelings, it's extra important to make them feel like they have someone to confide in. Be an active listener by reading between the lines, waiting for him to finish before you respond, and digging in with further questions. Avoid tying whatever he says back to yourself. You've told him you love him, now be patient as he works through his own emotions. Some silence, though it may feel awkward, is not a bad thing. He may be a bit shocked and need time to digest the news -- don't feel like one of you must always be talking. Just because you're not demanding a response doesn't mean you aren't pressuring him. If he disappears for a day or two, don't worry too much -- he just needs to process things. Chasing him down or following his every move, waiting to see how he responds, will only drive him farther away. If he is awkward or tells you he has other feelings, be kind and cordial -- you've done your part! But if he smiles or responds that he loves you too, there is no reason to rush down the aisle. Telling someone you love them in just another step in your relationship, not the end of the line. The important thing is treating him like you love him, not just saying the words.  Keep talking regularly, having open and honest conversations about your relationship. Don't feel the need to tell him you love him every day now -- actions speak louder than words. Ultimately, all you can do is express your feelings. You can't control how he is going to respond, nor should you. No matter what he says in return, you should respect his wishes and move on with your life. It takes a lot of bravery and passion to tell someone that you love them -- be proud of yourself for the effort and courage.",
      "If you make an effort to show you love once a day, whether with a good-night \"I love you\" or by simply putting his toothpaste on his brush for him, you'll keep the relationship strong for a long time. If you're worried about showing your affection, just think about finding one time a day where you can. Even an extra-long, passionate kiss is a great way to slow down time with your man for a half-second. Some people have a hard time saying the words \"I love you.\" But that doesn't mean that they don't love their partner. If you're someone who struggles a bit with showing affection, try these little techniques to let someone know you care:  Hold or squeezing hands Make plans together for the future, even just future dates Introduce your friends and/or family Surprise him with kisses, hugs, and affection Give compliments, encouragement, and admiration. Do little favors for him, especially when he seems upset. It sounds paradoxical, but sometimes the best thing you can do is not see him at all. Remember -- you fell in love as separate people with separate lives -- you need to preserve some of this independence to stay happy and in love. Don't feel like you need to talk or check in constantly to show how much you care. Sometimes giving each other some free time is the best way to show you know and love someone. Do not avoid fights or issues just by saying \"I love you,\" and accepting your concerns. The most in-love couples have arguments too, and you need to air them out openly and honestly to keep your love alive. So don't feel like you're destroying your love, or going back on your word, if you bring up a disagreement or issue -- you're just showing your love in another way. Don't ever let a partner get you to do something you don't want to to \"prove your love.\" Love doesn't need to be proven. Everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to saying \"I love you.\" There are those  that say it after every phone call and those that only save it for special moments, and there is everything in between. So don't worry about how often you should say \"I love you,\" or how often you hear it -- people are different, and show their love in different ways.  These words mean much more when you mean them. If you only say \"I love you\" when you're feeling full of love, you'll both be much happier."

      "In a large bowl, sift together the flours, spices, sugar, salt, and yeast.  In a different small bowl, whisk together the butter and hot water to melt the butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the milk. Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it briefly. Add the egg, oil, and butter and milk to the dry ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients together. Continue mixing until the ingredients come together to form a smooth dough. If mixing with the spoon becomes difficult, knead the dough with your hands instead. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place it somewhere warm to rise for one to two hours. It’s important to cover the dough so that it doesn’t dry out. A good warm place for the dough to rise is an oven that’s turned off, but with the oven light turned on. When the dough is ready, cover your hands with a layer of oil and turn the dough out onto a flat surface. Roll the dough out with your hands into a long cylinder that’s two inches (5 cm) thick.  Cut the dough cylinder into smaller pieces that are one to two inches (2.5 to five cm) long. Arrange the dough pieces on two baking sheets and leave them to rise for another 30 to 40 minutes. While the dough is rising for the second time, prepare the syrup. The doughnuts will be fried and then dunked into the syrup right away, so it needs to be ready for when the doughnuts are fried.  Combine the sugar, water, and spices in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent the sugar from burning. When it comes to a boil, lower the heat and continue simmering and stirring until the syrup becomes thick. Lower the heat again and keep the syrup warm over low heat until the doughnuts are ready. Fill a deep fryer or deep frying pan with oil and heat it over medium–high heat. Drop a pea-sized piece of dough into the oil. When it begins to cook and sizzle, you know the oil is ready.  Take a piece of dough and stretch it out slightly to get an oval shape. Repeat with every dough piece before frying. Drop a couple oval dough pieces into the oil, but don’t crowd them. Fry the dough until the koeksisters become golden brown, about one to two minutes. Remove the doughnuts from the oil one at a time using a slotted spoon. Place them on a paper towel to remove some of the excess oil. Poke a few holes in each doughnut with a fork. Transfer the doughnuts to the warm syrup and roll them around to coat all sides. When the doughnuts are drenched in syrup, remove them one at a time with the slotted spoon. Allow the excess syrup to drain off over the saucepan. Roll each doughnut in the shredded coconut to coat them completely. Transfer them to a serving plate and enjoy!",
      "The night before you plan to make your koeksisters, make a batch of syrup. This gives the syrup time to chill, and the hot doughnuts will be dipped into the cold syrup to get them crispy and shiny.  Bring the water, sugar, and cream of tartar to a boil over medium heat in a small saucepan. Stir constantly so the sugar doesn’t burn. When the mixture comes to a boil, add the lemon juice. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. You can also add a pinch of cinnamon and dried ginger to the syrup at this point if you want to add a bit of spice. After simmering, remove the syrup from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. Then divide the syrup into two separate bowls and chill overnight in the fridge. Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Sifting will remove clumps and make the batter smooth. Add the butter to the flour and use the tips of your fingers to rub the butter into the flour until the butter has been distributed throughout. You want to distribute the butter in the flour as evenly as possible. The texture will become slightly crumbly. Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it together with the water until incorporated. Then pour the egg into the flour and stir with a spoon to combine all the ingredients.  Continue stirring until everything comes together as a ball of dough. Then knead the dough until it becomes smooth and soft. Cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap or a damp towel and set it aside for an hour to rest. Heat the oil over medium heat in a deep fryer or in a deep frying pan. For the best results, you want about three to four inches (seven to 10 cm) of oil. Place a pea-sized ball of dough into the oil.  When the piece of dough begins to cook and sizzle, the oil is ready. If you have a candy thermometer, heat the oil to about 340 F (171 C). Turn the dough out onto a flat and lightly oiled surface. Grease a rolling pin with a bit of oil and roll out the dough into a large rectangle that’s about a quarter-inch (6.3 mm) thick. Cut the dough into long thin strips that are about an inch (2.5 cm) wide and six inches (15 cm) long. Take three strips of dough and pinch them all together at one end. Then braid the three pieces together. When you get to the end of the dough, pinch all three ends together to seal them.  To braid the dough, lay the three strips out side by side. Take the left strip and lay it over the middle strip, so that the two switch positions. Then take the right strip and lay it over the middle strip. Go back to the left strip and lay it over the middle again. Repeat until you reach the end of the strips. Repeat this process with all the dough strips until you have assembled all the koeksisters. This recipe will make about a dozen doughnuts. If you have any strips of dough left, you can cut them in half lengthwise to make smaller koeksisters, or fry single strips of dough. Place a few doughnuts into the hot oil and let them cook for about three to five minutes, until they are golden brown. When they are cooked, transfer them to a paper towel for a few seconds to allow the excess oil to drain off. When the first batch of doughnuts is cooking in the oil, remove one of the bowls of syrup from the fridge and place the entire bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice.  Keep the other bowl chilling in the fridge. After a few seconds on the paper towel, dunk the doughnuts immediately into the bowl of syrup. Allow the doughnuts to soak in the syrup for a minute or two.  Remove the koeksisters from the syrup with a slotted spoon, allowing the excess syrup to drain off back into the bowl. Transfer the syrupy doughnuts to a wire rack to cool. When the bowl of syrup becomes warm from the hot doughnuts, return it to the fridge and start using the second chilled batch. Place the fresh batch into a bowl of ice as well. Allow the koeksisters to cool to room temperature before serving. If you have extra syrup left over, transfer it to small serving bowls for dunking the doughnuts into."

If you build your own website from scratch, you will need to select a payment system that works for you and your customers, such as PayPal or Google Pay. Try to select a domain name that reflects your personal brand and the kind of work you do. Stock photo vendors like Shutterstock, SmugMug, and 500px offer an easy way to sell your photos to an established audience. Each vendor has different pricing and licensing policies, so shop around to find the one that fits your needs.  Many of these services require a monthly subscription fee for hosting and selling your photos, so you will probably need to post a lot of photos in order to make a profit. Most stock photo agencies offer either a percentage or a flat fee for the sale of each photo. Fees may vary depending on the size or resolution of the photo and how the buyer plans to use it. While smaller agencies may let you start submitting photos right away, some of the larger ones (like Getty) have a more selective and complicated review process. In addition to selling digital copies of your photos, you might want to offer more tangible merchandise, such as prints. You can sell high-quality prints through websites like Fine Art America, or put your designs on merchandise like shirts and buttons using custom vendors like CafePress or Zazzle. If you make your own prints or other products featuring your photographs, Etsy is a good option that allows you to keep a generous percentage of the profits.",
      "of your work. Pull together a few of your very best shots for your portfolio. Make sure to select images that you’re happy with and that you feel are representative of the work you do. Whether you’re offering your services as a professional photographer or just trying to sell photos you’ve snapped on your own, a portfolio is a great way to show off your work.  If you’re not comfortable making your own website, use a portfolio website like PhotoShelter, Squarespace, or SmugMug. You may need to pay a monthly fee to use these services. Building a portfolio is also a good way to define your niche as a photographer. For example, you might focus on beefing up your reputation as someone who takes breathtaking nature photos or mouthwatering food pictures. You can use a service like Facebook or start a dedicated blog to post pictures and talk about your photography. Once you start building a following, you can use your social media platform to let people know where they can purchase your photos.  Many social media sites will promote your content for a fee. For example, you can use the “Sponsored Posts” feature on LinkedIn or click “Boost Post” on Facebook to advertise your work to a larger audience. Reach out to friends and family and ask them to spread the word about your work through their own social media accounts. Try making chatty posts that give your followers an idea of who you are as a person as well as an artist. For example, “I had a wonderful time connecting with the ancient past—and with myself—during my recent trip to Egypt! Check out these images I captured of Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir el-Bahri, available for sale on my website now.” Take a look at the prices other vendors are setting (and that buyers are offering) for photos similar yours. Setting an appropriate price for your photos depends on a lot of factors, including the quality of the photo, the uniqueness of the composition and subject matter, and who is buying the picture.  Consider the audience for your photos. If you’re selling to individuals, you’ll probably make a lot less than you would selling your photos to a big-budget magazine or website. You can use online tools like Getty Image’s price calculator to help you find a reasonable price range for your image based on factors like how the photo will be used and the nature of your target market.  Apps like price-a-photo by Pixel Cents can also simplify the pricing process.",
      "Arts and crafts fairs are great places to sell your photos and network with other photographers and artists. Do a search for an upcoming art fair or market near you, or use an online directory like Art Fair Calendar or Fairs and Festivals. Start looking for potential shows at least 4 to 6 months in advance of when you plan to display your photos.  Contact the organizers of the event as early as possible so that you can get your application in and select the tent or booth of your choice. You’ll also need to consider budgetary factors, such as the cost of reserving a booth, making prints, and creating an attractive display. Put some thought into how you want to display and curate your photos for the show. You may find it helpful to select photos that fit a specific theme or have a particular tone. Be sure to offer a variety of sizes and formats, including larger, more expensive framed prints and smaller, more affordable matted photos. If you’re not already familiar with the galleries in your area, do an online search or ask around in the photography community. Visit some galleries in person to see what kind of artwork and photos they display and sell, and ask about the possibility of selling some of your work.  You may also be able to get your work displayed and sold at local cafes and coffee shops. Some galleries or shops may charge a monthly fee for featuring your work on their walls. Others may simply ask for a percentage of the profits if they sell any of your work. Businesses like doctors’ offices, banks, and real estate stagers are often in need of photographs and art prints to decorate their walls. Contact businesses in your area to find out if they are interested in purchasing prints from you. Some businesses feature rotating art displays that can act as a form of advertising for your work."

      "If you are concerned that your crush on your teacher is impacting your day-to-day life and also preventing you from concentrating on your studies, talk to a therapist or school guidance counselor. If you are concerned about privacy, talk to a therapist rather than a guidance counselor. Your therapist is required by a code of ethics to keep what you say confidential. Guidance counselors are not bound by the same code, and can easily report information that's revealed to them. Your friends may have similar experiences coping with crushes and might be able to offer some interesting advice or perspective. If nothing else, talking about your feelings might make you feel less alone. If you find yourself unable to stop thinking about or interacting inappropriately with your teacher, it might be time to make a more drastic change. Talk to your guidance counselor or academic advisor about transferring out of the class. Be honest with your counselor about the feelings you're having for your teacher. If they don't fully understand how much these feelings are distracting you from your schoolwork, they might not be willing to let you change classes. Trust that they are professionals who are trained to deal with situations like this.",
      "Pursue new hobbies and renew old passions. Join new clubs and sports or recommit to old ones. Take the time and energy you previously spent lusting after your teacher and put it towards something productive. Also try to get out and find some new people to spend time with to get your mind off them. Develop relationships with other people, especially people your own age. Work on strengthening current friendships and cultivating new ones. Open your mind to meeting and spending time with new people and you may find yourself falling out of love faster than you think! Taking a trip or changing up your surroundings is incredibly healthy. Traveling can help you expand your mind and see the world in an entirely new light. Traveling also teaches patience, flexibility and perspective; which are all important qualities that will help you get over your teacher. The best way to get over an old relationship is to get involved in a new one. Don't rush into anything you're not comfortable with, but allow yourself to be open to the idea of dating and pursuing relationships with new people, because you have to move on. There's no agreed upon length of time to wait after suffering a broken heart. But it is important to take some time to yourself after a breakup to rediscover who you are, what you like and what you value in yourself and in a future partner.",
      "The reason you are in school is to learn and get a proper education, so take the energy you would normally spend thinking about your teacher and re-focus on it and also on your work. You’ll see improvements in your academic performance and it will take your mind off your teacher. Thoughts frequently lead to action and visualizing something makes it more likely to occur and people will see you. Thinking about your teacher increases your chances of doing something you might later regret. Try focusing on things about your teacher that you don't like. The idea here is not to dwell on the negatives, but to remind yourself that the relationship was not as perfect as you remember it being, e.g. Age difference, appearances. Interact with your teacher in class, but do not seek them out or try to spend time with them outside of your designated class time. It just isn't right for you, especially as they are probably quite a bit older than you. It is generally okay to date a person older than you in later life, but a young person dating an older teacher is often considered inappropriate. Do not contact them on social media or try to meet with them outside of school. Respect their position as your teacher and give them the space that they need to do that job well. Making decisions in advance about how you will handle your impulses can help you to be more successful in conquering them. Think about how you’d like to act when talking to your teacher and then follow through on your plan.",
      "Understanding the problem is the first step in moving forward. Don’t feel bad about having a crush; crushes are something that everyone experiences at some point of view and the human brain is actually biologically programmed to fall in love. Getting over a relationship is hard, even if that relationship never fully materialized. Give yourself some time to mope around and feel badly, then pick yourself up and move forward. Make sure you're not upset for too long. While feeling sad, also take steps to comfort yourself. Try taking a hot shower, listening to one of your favorite playlists and speaking nicely to yourself. Knowing that this relationship will never progress is an important step in moving past it. Remind yourself again and again that what you’re doing is necessary for your own personal happiness and growth.  Remember that you will have other crushes. In many people's minds, having a crush on your teacher veers towards the inappropriate sector, no matter how you feel. It is against the law to be with someone over 18 if you are under 18. There will be others who you will prefer in the future, and others who you have a real chance with. Focus ahead, without dwelling too much on this dynamic with your teacher."

      "For easier clean-up, cover the baking sheets with aluminum foil first, then coat the foil with cooking spray. You can do this by cutting the potatoes in half lengthwise, in half again, and then into wedges, and finally into thin strips.  The matchstick shape is important. Combined with the high baking temperature, it is what will give you nice, crispy fries. You can leave the potatoes unpeeled, or you can peel them first. Consider adding other seasonings, such as pepper, garlic powder, and fresh, chopped rosemary. You will be tossing the potatoes in this, so make sure that the bowl is big enough. An easy way to do this would be to cover the bowl with a tight-fitting lid, and then shaking it. Make sure that the fries aren't clumped together or touching. Use another baking sheet, if necessary. If the fries are clumped together, they won't turn out very crispy. The longer you bake them for, the crispier they will become. About halfway through the baking time, toss the fries with a spatula or a pair of tongs. This ensures even baking. To make garlic fries: During the last 10 minutes of baking, sauté 3 cloves of garlic in 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil until it turns brown, then set it aside.

A quick and simple way to do this would be to cover the bowl with a lid, and then shaking it a few times. Make sure that the potato wedges are not clumped together, or they won't bake properly. If you want crispier wedges, make sure that they aren't touching; use a separate baking sheet, if necessary.

      "Your fingertips are your most accessible and cost-effective tool. Start at the base of the cylinder or pad, grasp a clump of hair, and gently pry up and away. It’s important to take your time as hair strands break easily and will become difficult to remove. When it comes to hairbrush cleansing tools, the miniature hairbrush rake tops the list. While this tool is similar to a comb, it is far more effective. Cleaning rakes vary in size, as well as in single or dual sides. For bristled brushes or if you have multiple styles and sizes of brushes, a dual sided rake is more versatile. Hold the bristled hairbrush over the sink, a trash can, or take it outdoors. Brush the nylon brush through the bristles of your hairbrush. This will remove hair buildup, as well as dislodge skin and dandruff flakes. Continue brushing until the nylon brush rakes cleanly through the brush bristles.  Wash the nylon brush to remove debris and allow it to dry completely before reusing it for this purpose. Teasing combs are dual sided with bristles and a hair sectioning point called a rat tail. Beginning at the base of your bristled brush, slide the rat tail under the collected hair and gently pull away from the brush. Repeat this on all sides of the cylinder or across the entire face of the pad. Once you have loosened and lifted the hair from the shaft, simply use your fingers to roll the hair up and off. Oftentimes, the hair will clump or knot in the process of removal. Make sure to have a pair of scissors handy for these occasions. Simple cut through the clump or knot to divide it into two or three sections. Be careful not to cut too much or the smaller pieces of hair may remain stuck.",
      "Tea tree oil is an all-natural and highly-effective cleansing agent available at your local drug store or health foods market. Pour one cup of warm water into a medium sized bowl. Add a few drops of tea tree oil and stir to combine. For those with sensitive skin or allergies, using your own shampoo, plus baking soda, is a safe and gentle option. Pour one cup of warm water into a medium sized bowl. Add a teaspoon of shampoo and a teaspoon of baking soda and stir to combine. Using a clean toothbrush, dip the brush end in the solution. Make sure that the toothbrush bristles are completely soaked with the cleansing agent. Take the toothbrush and brush the cylinder or pad from the base, where the bristles are connected to the brush head, all the way to the top. This will remove oil, dandruff, and leftover hair product. Move around the hairbrush methodically to cover the entire surface. Make sure to include small circular motions to help dredge up heavily soiled brushes. After scrubbing the bristled brush cylinder or pad, dip the head of your hairbrush into the cleansing agent. This will help to remove any loose particles, as well as provide a second rinsing, which is particularly useful on stubborn hair product build up.  If the hairbrush has a wooden handle or paddle, do not submerge the brush in the water. Most wooden brushes are coated in a moisture repellant, but they aren’t 100% resistant. Instead of submerging in the bowl of water, perform one or two additional toothbrush cleanings. Fill a second medium sized bowl with clean and cool water. Lower your hairbrush into the water gently submerging the entire bristled area. For circular brushes, you may have to twist your brush in your palms to make sure the entire area has been rinsed. If you have a wooden bristled brush, hold the brush bristle side down over a sink or a towel. Take a mist or spray bottle and soak the cleansed bristles until the water runs clear from the bristles.",
      "It's important to immediately remove any excess water that has collected in the bristles or on the pad of a wooden brush. Moisture can cling and seep into brush bristles, cloth brush pads, and wood causing mold and rot. Using a cloth, gently press between the bristles to reach the surface of the cylinder or pad. Make sure to use adequate pressure to soak up any excess moisture. Once you have absorbed excess moisture, it's important to allow the brush to fully dry before use. Place the bristles facing down on a clean and dry towel and allow to dry overnight. If you need to use your brush right away, use a hair dryer set to its lowest setting to speed the drying process. Go back and forth over the brush a few times to blow out any remaining water drops and to ensure that the hairbrush is now damp rather than soaking wet."

      ". Whatever religion or belief system that you align you with, or even if you don't align yourself with any organized religion at all, you need to carve out time in your schedule for deep contemplation and meditative training. Pray, meditate, and contemplate constantly.   To start praying, focus less on asking specific yes-no types of questions and more on focusing on feeling. How does it feel to get in touch with the higher power in which you believe? How does talking with your god affect your soul? For some monastics, time needs to be divided evenly between reading the great texts, meditating, and experiencing the world. As a rule of thumb, don't spend more time praying than you spend studying the religious texts you study, and vice versa. There's no specific goal or outcome of a meditative practice. You don't come out the other side of a meditation sitting feeling as if you've learned something, necessarily, or as if you've solved the big problems that you seek. Instead, focus on stilling yourself and increasing your awareness, then taking that into the world.   To start meditating, learn to still your thoughts and watch them float through your mind without identifying them actively. Just sit, focus on your breathing, and fix your gaze on the void. Try to hold onto your meditation-mind for as long as possible throughout the day. Notice the little things. Slow down. A popular Zen saying compares Zen to a boat. You use when you need to cross the river, but you don't take it with you. Learn to leave your Zen on the shore when it becomes unnecessary. Religion, meditative practices, and other aspects of your mystical experience should serve your understanding of the world, not burden it. It's important to spend time with like-minded believers who take their mystical practice seriously. Learn by observing and having complicated conversations with people from your church, organization, or other religious groups. Bounce ideas and interpretations off each other. Learn as much as you can. In some traditions, finding a teacher, mentor, or guru is an essential part of practicing your own brand of mysticism and developing as a mystical thinker. If you're ready to pledge yourself to a serious practice, consider finding a personal teacher.",
      "Whether you think of yourself as a deeply spiritual person or not, a mystic is one who seeks to find order in the chaos and collect evidence of that order. If you're the kind of person who sees every strange coincidence, every elegant metaphor, or every pretty rainbow as a sign of something greater, you might begin to feel the presence of a guiding hand in which you place your trust.  Religious mystics place their trust in a higher power, a powerful being that creates and controls the world and the people in it. Sometimes, as in the case of Zen Buddhism, religious mystics will also place their trust in a practice, that asceticism and meditation are the truest way to understand the world. Mystics aren't always religious, though they often are. The writing of quantum physicists and Jungian psychologists often borders on the mystical, the deeper it gets. Whatever system, being, or practice you've found in which to place your trust, place it there. Seek to find order and balance in the world, rather than emphasizing differences and disparities. Look for things you have in common with your enemies. Regardless of your spiritual or religious leanings, it's good to read and study a wide variety of mystical writings, across disciplines and dogmas. Christian writer Thomas Merton spent considerable time studying Zen Buddhism, mphasize experience. What is a mystic? What differentiates a Christian mystic from a regular Christian, or a Buddhist mystic from a regular Buddhist? Across practices, disciplines, and cultures, mystics have one thing in common: a deep personal and spiritual connection to their belief system. To the mystic, a personal experience of spirituality is always more powerful and more important than book-learning or hearsay. Simply going to church isn't enough for the mystic. Avoid the showy materialist trappings of some religions. You don't need an expensive rock garden, koi pond, and meditation pad to be a Buddhist mystic. You don't need a 13th-century crucifix to be a Christian. . Mystics need to center themselves and be fully present at all times. A mystic isn't distracted by electronic devices, stresses, or complex schedules for the day. Instead, the mystic should be focused completely on doing one thing and one thing only. When you're eating lunch, just eat lunch. Focus entirely on nourishing your body, slowing down, enjoying what you eat. When you're reading the newspaper, just focus on learning, reading the words, and understanding the concepts. Put yourself completely into each task. This can be surprisingly difficult, and it won't happen right away. Buzzing text alerts and constant 21st century noise can make it hard to slow down and focus. Try to simplify your life as much as possible. Start small. Put your phone away, except when you actively need it to make a call or send a message. Mystics want personal connections to the spiritual world and the self, not hearsay. Received wisdom and platitudes are made to be questioned by mystics. If you want to develop your mystical connections to the world, both seen and unseen, start asking the big questions. Whatever your religious or spiritual leanings, learn to embrace the big questions:  Why are we here? What does it mean to live a good life? Who am I? What happens when we die? What does death mean to me? Not only is it important to ask the big questions, but to trust that your instincts will lead you to the answers that you seek. Trust in yourself. Develop your intuition and your self-reliance. Eliminate your doubts and trust that you'll have the faith to discover what you're looking for.",
      "Studying mystical writings and tomes is an essential way to learn about the lives of the mystics. Each tradition will have a wide variety of different mystics and different dogmas, and it's important to get some sense of the scope of different writings. Everything starts to seem interconnected and becomes more alike than different:  Thomas Merton's No Man is an Island  St. Augustine's Confessions of St. Augustine  The Cloud of Unknowing, written anonymously Julian of Norwich's Revelation of Divine Love  DT Suzuki's An Introduction to Zen Buddhism  The Nasruddin Stories from the Sufic tradition Mystical practice is a combination of self-imposed meditation and contemplation and the specific guidelines of your religion or other practice. Each religious life will be different, because each religious person is different. Deciding what's most important to you and your practice is a decision that only one person can make. You. For some mystical Christians, living life as close to the way Christ lived is the most important aspect of practicing. For others, spreading the gospel is essential. Both ways of thinking can lead to mysticism and deep appreciations of the spiritual world. Mystics aren't part-time. Whatever your deep connection to religion and the big questions, it needs to be your biggest priority in life. Not your job, your family, or your hobbies. Your connection with the cosmos needs to be your biggest commitment. For many people, being a mystic is an entirely solitary life. Most mystics are monastic for a reason. If you want to be a mystic, it's hard to go out on Saturday night and have fun. Are you up to the challenge to commit? Part of Zen meditation revolves around letting go of these big concerns and embracing the void. For the mystic, that void should be your living room. Trusting in your instincts and diving into the biggest questions has a tendency to lead to even more questions than answers. It could either be frustrating or liberating to realize that you might never know what will happen after you die, or whether or not you're really \"right\" about your way of interpreting the world."

      "Place the seeds in a cup of water and place the cup in the fridge overnight. The wet and cold conditions will help jumpstart your seeds so they germinate faster.  If any of the seeds float to the top of the water, throw them away. You only want to germinate seeds that sink in the container. You can also grow ghost peppers from seedlings, but these may be harder to find than seeds. Plant them in small seedling containers or peat pods. Push the seeds 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) down into the soil and cover them up.  If you're using peat pods, wet them until they swell up. Then push your seeds just below the surface. If you're using seedling containers, fill them with soil and then cover the seeds. Place 2-3 seeds per pod or container. You can thin the seedlings later if all of them sprout. Keep the seeds moist while waiting for them to germinate. If you planted them in peat pods, they'll stay moist for a while. If you're using seedling containers, lightly mist them with water until the soil is thoroughly wet.  Lightly cover the pods or containers with plastic wrap to help the pots retain moisture. Water whenever necessary to keep the pods/soil moist. Look for a warm, bright spot to place your pods or containers in, such as on top of your fridge or in a sunny window. Keeping them there will encourage your seeds to germinate. Look for tiny green sprouts to pop out of the soil or peat pod once the seeds have germinated. If conditions are right, this should only take about 11 days. Leave the seedlings in the pods until they are about 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall. At this point, they'll probably have 3 or more leaves. Continue to keep the soil/pod moist, but not soaked, while your seedlings grow.",
      "If you're planting pepper plants in the ground, pick an area that is free of any muddy areas or pools of water. On the other hand, the soil should not be completely dry, either. If your soil does not drain well, the easiest option is to grow your ghost peppers in planters filled with potting soil. To test how well your soil drains:  Take a coffee can and remove its top and bottom. Dig a hole 4 inches (10 cm) deep into your soil. Set the coffee can in the hole. Fill in any extra space around it with soil. Pour water into the can until it fills up. Wait an hour, then come back and measure how far down the water has dropped in the can, using a ruler. If 2 inches (5.1 cm) or more of water has drained out within the hour, then your soil drains well. Peppers thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soil that has a pH between 6.2 and 7.0. Buy a soil pH testing kit from any garden store. You can use either a digital probe or paper strips. Just follow the instructions included with your kit for proper use.  You can add pulverized limestone to your soil if it is too acidic. Usually, you can apply 5 pounds (2.3 kg) per 100 feet (30 m) square. If you're working with a small area, just lightly sprinkle a bit on  your soil. If your soil is too alkaline (with a pH above 7.0), then you can add soil sulfur by lightly sprinkling some where you want to grow your peppers. Some gardeners will place 2-3 unlit matches in the soil per plant instead (match heads contain sulfur). Pulverized limestone and soil sulfur can be found at garden stores. Follow the package directions for exact instructions on how to mix them into your soil. Peppers need lots of warmth and light to grow well. If you have plants in containers, you can move them around during the day to ensure they get as much sun as possible. If there is ever a danger of frost, you'll need to cover the plants with a frost blanket. Dump a layer of compost about 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick on top of the soil where you want to plant your peppers. Use a spade to mix it into the first layer of soil. Add some bone and blood meal to the soil to make it even richer.  Blood and bone meal are available at garden stores. Just follow the package directions for instructions on how much to use. If you are planting your peppers in containers, just use a good quality loamy soil mix.",
      "Ghost peppers are so spicy that few bugs pose a problem, but some slugs may bother your plants. If you see chewed on leaves, sprinkle diatomaceous earth (available at a garden store) around the base of your plants.  Occasionally, aphids, pill bugs, or leafminers will bother ghost pepper plants, but this is very rare. If they do appear, ask your local garden supply store for a good quality organic insecticide. If you see spots on your plants' leaves, this is probably a fungus that thrives in damp soil conditions. Back off on watering your plants to discourage the fungus. Ghost peppers will start out green, then become orange, finally a brilliant red. The exact amount of time it takes for peppers to appear on your plants will vary depending on how warm your area is. In most cases, expect it to take 100 to 120 days for ghost peppers to reach full size. The peppers will be 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) long when full grown. The peppers become hotter the longer they stay on the plant. Ghost peppers are extremely spicy and can burn bare skin. Wear gloves, long sleeves, and goggles when you are harvesting the peppers. Clip the stems carefully instead of yanking peppers from the plants. Don't let cut peppers touch your bare skin. Keep children away from the peppers.",
      "Ghost peppers thrive in a warm, humid environment where the temperature is 70 °F (21 °C) or higher for at least 5 months out of the year. If you're worried about colder temperatures, plant the seedlings in pots or raised soil beds so the soil they're in stays warmer. If any of your plants are withered, diseased, or browned, pull them out of the soil. That way, there will be more room for healthy plants to grow. If you're going to plant the seedlings outside, acclimate them over a 10 day period by moving them outside for a few hours a day. Leave them outside for one hour longer each day. To plant the seedlings, dig a small hole in the soil just larger than the seed pod. Place it in the hole and pack extra soil in the space around it. Water it well when you're done.  A 4 in (10 cm) pot will be fine for a pepper seedling at first. If you are putting your seedlings in the ground, just space them 12 to 48 inches (30 to 122 cm) apart. You can move your plants into larger containers later on if the original container becomes too small. Ghost peppers need soil that is always slightly damp, but not soaked through. Water as often as you need to keep it in this condition. The exact frequency will depend on your location and the weather conditions.  For best results, water in early morning or after the sun starts to set. Add a layer of mulch around the plants to help the soil retain moisture. You can find this at your local garden store. Mix the fertilizer according to the package instructions, then add it to the soil around your plants. Fish and kelp fertilizer is a great organic option for nurturing your pepper plants. When you start to see flowers (which will be small, light colored, and have pointed petals) on your plants, switch to a fertilizer with higher phosphorus and potassium content to help encourage pepper production.  Look for a fertilizer that is labeled 20-20-20. These numbers refer to the proportions of the minerals nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers, since these will cause the flowers to fall off, and you plant will not produce peppers. You can find good options for organic fertilizers at most garden stores."

      "Depending on where you are walking, choose a way to protect yourself. You may choose to carry a large stick, a dog whistle, dog deterrent spray, or a stun gun.  You can purchase commercial products that are proven to deter dog attacks.  Look for a whistle that irritates dogs. You can blow the whistle and most dogs will run away from you. A traditional whistle can also work by startling the dog.  In addition to the traditional stun gun, you can find stun batons that not only work on dogs but may frighten them away before you have to use it. The dog will see the baton and hear its electric charge, frightening it. Don't make eye contact because the dog could see it as a challenge. Instead, watch the dog in your peripheral vision. Baring teeth is a sign of aggression for dogs, so smiling or having your mouth open can signal to the dog that you are a threat. Instead, press your lips together to hide your teeth. While commands might not work as well for stray dogs, yelling a firm, one-word command can get a dog to back off. Try commands such as “Stop”, “No,” and “Back”. Don't use a friendly voice when speaking to the dog, and avoid screaming or shrieking. Carry a spray bottle or a water bottle that has a nozzle. If you are approached by an aggressive dog, spraying it with water can get it to run off.",
      "Some dogs aren't ready to meet new people, so don't assume that a dog that is out for its walk wants to be petted. The owner can also offer advice on how to best engage the dog if it is friendly.  Don't run or move quickly toward a dog. Never approach or pet a dog that is nursing her puppies. A flat hand will keep you safe and show the dog that you aren't a threat. Extend your hand but don't touch the dog until it's ready. If the dog is open to you petting it, then it will come to you. Keep your hand extended so that the dog can smell you and decide if it wants you to pet it. If you are afraid, don't reach out to the dog. Dogs can sense your emotions and might get scared. A friendly dog will perk his ears and lower his head. A dog that tilts his ears back, growls, or cowers does not want to be petted, so slowly back away. If the dog shows that it's okay with you, gently pet it. Pet the dog only on his head or upper back. Lightly pet the dog in his safe spots, avoiding his belly, tails, ears, and feet. If you know that there are a lot of dogs where you like to walk, consider carrying treats, such as a milk bone. Giving the dog a small treat can make you instant friends. Ask the dog's owner before giving it a treat. The dog may be on a special diet or may have already had treats.",
      "If you know that dogs frequent a particular area, choose another path for your walk. This is especially important if the dogs are strays as they are more likely to be hungry or territorial.  While it's common for dogs to share walkways with people, think about how comfortable you are around dogs before you go to an area that is popular for dog walking. Dogs can sense emotions and will know if you're uncomfortable, which could trigger a stressed dog. Be on guard while walking on country roads. Unwanted dogs are often dumped in the country and left to fend for themselves, which leads to roaming dogs along country roads. Always carry a big stick and other protective items such as a stun gun while walking alone on a country road. If you are going on a walk to explore a new area, ask the locals about the likelihood of dog encounters. Dogs roam in packs in some countries or rural areas, so get information about how to stay safe before you go exploring. Dogs are very territorial and will aggressively defend their home. If you see a dog or know that a dog lives at a particular house, change up your route to avoid the dog. Large dogs can jump fences if they're agitated. If you see a dog that is walking near you or is engaged in an activity nearby, don't walk up on it. It's best to quietly walk in the opposite direction. Surprising a dog can make even the gentlest dog act out aggressively because it's afraid.",
      "If you run, the dog will instinctively try to catch you. It will see you as prey to chase down. Instead, you want to make yourself seem like you aren't a threat and aren't prey. Protect your torso and face by lifting your knee in front of your body. If the dog does bite or scratch, it won't be able to reach your stomach, neck, or face. Larger breeds instinctively go for your face, so block them with your arms. Crossing your arms will put up a stronger barrier than just flailing your arms in front of your face. Further protect your head by tucking it under your arms. Lean your head forward and fold your crossed arms backward so that your head is covered. Since dogs have prey instinct, curling into a ball can end the dog's urge to attack. While you may be afraid to lay on the ground, it's the safest option during a dog attack. Just play dead.  Don't move or try to scoot away. Just curl as tightly into a ball as you can. Remove any items of clothing that may be around your neck since the dog may pull on it to play tug-of-war, which could strangle you. Fight back only if the dog is small. Fighting back can make the dog fight harder, especially if it's a larger breed that can overpower you. Don't try to engage the dog at all while you're on the ground. That means don't look at the dog, don't try to talk to it, and don't try to sooth it by petting it. The dog is in attack mode, and engaging with it will only antagonize it more. You can continue to shout commands if you've chosen to do so. The dog will only struggle to bite harder and hold on if you try to pull away. Additionally, you can rip the skin more and make your wound worse."

    ],
    "document": [
      "For good measure, tip your pack upside down over a bin and shake it to get any bits of trash out. Only when your pack is empty will you have an adequate sense of what it can accommodate. If you’ve organized your pack in the same way for a long while, emptying it out completely can help you imagine new ways to organize it more efficiently. Even if your backpack feels light when you first pack it, it will start to feel heavy after a few hours of hiking. Go through the items you plan on putting into your pack, and find the heaviest ones. Decide whether or not you really need them for the trip.  For instance, if you have a cooking pan you really like but rarely use, it might be a good idea to leave it at home. Consider replacing it with a lighter pan instead. How much your backpack weighs in the end depends on what you can personally carry and endure. Different people can carry different amounts of weight. When organizing an internal frame backpack, the area at the bottom should be reserved for light material, while the medium-weight stuff should be packed on top of it. The heaviest things should be packed in the middle of the forward-most area of the backpack. In other words, the heaviest items should be against the area that actually touches your back. Similar to an internal frame backpack, you want to start with the lightest items first. After that, you want to add the medium-weight items, and finally, the heaviest. Tuck them as tightly as possible against the forward-most area of the pack. The goal in both modes of organization is to center the weight on your hips so that you can more easily maintain balance. Items that you might use or need at any time – insect repellents, snacks, rain ponchos, and so on – should be placed in outer pockets. That way, you can grab and use them easily without having to stop, unpack, find the items, and repack. If your backpack doesn't have many outer pockets, keep the more useful items towards the top. Leave the items you seldom use towards the bottom. Here is where you can think outside the box and get a little creative. Many items, such as cooking pots and bear canisters, take up a lot of space, but they are hallow in the inside. Why let all that hallow space go to waste? You can take advantage of it by filling it with useful items. For example:  You can place shirts or rolled-up socks inside cooking pots. Rolls of duct tape can slide over hiking poles. Bear canisters are perfect for cramming with snacks and other scented items. Many hiking and camping backpacks have special compartments that have been designed for particular purposes.  For instance, many backpacks have space for a water bladder (typically located directly behind and at the top of the pack).  Other packs have slots specifically designed for sleeping bags. Consult your backpack owner’s guide to identify how the manufacturer intended the backpack to be used.",
      "Take everything out of your backpack first, including any smaller compartments. Next, tip it over a trashcan and shake it to get those last few scraps, crumbs, and bits of lint out.   If you’re starting with a brand-new and empty backpack, you’re way ahead of the game. If your backpack is stuffed full of papers, books, and other stuff from your previous semester, empty it completely. In your first pile, place all of your school textbooks, folders, binders, and notebooks. In your second pile, place your school supplies, such as pens, pencils, erasers, glue, etc. In your last pile, put the other items that you use on a daily or seasonal basis, such as your lunch box, scarf, mittens, etc.   If you take your laptop to school, you should put it in the first pile too. Discard or put away anything that doesn’t fit in any of these 3 piles, such as trash, candy, toys, extra phone chargers, etc. Backpacks typically have 1 large compartment and at least 1 small compartment. Open up the small compartment, and start putting your school supplies away into it.   Some backpacks even have slots for pens, pencils, and cellphones. Use these for those items. If your backpack doesn’t have a smaller compartment, get a pencil bag. Put your supplies into the bag, then put it into your backpack. For example, put all of your English books, notebooks, and binders into 1 pile, and all of your Science stuff into another pile. If you have any loose papers, put them away into the right folder or binder first.   If you need to buy new binders, folders, and notebooks, consider color-coding them. Use a different color for different subjects, like red for English and blue for Science. Stack binders with their spines facing away from each other. This will create a straight stack rather than a sloped one. It will take up less space. Unless you want to lag around a heavy backpack that is almost as big as you are, there is no need to pack everything. Each morning or evening before school, go through your backpack and take out anything that you don't need for the next day. Put everything that you do need back into your backpack.  Leave the stuff that you don't need at home or in your locker. This also goes for school supplies. If you take art class once per week, there is no need to carry around your art supplies every day. While not absolutely necessary, this can come in handy, especially if you are in middle school or junior high. If you get a permission slip or report card that your parents need to sign, you’ll need a safe place to put it. Use a separate folder for this purpose.  Place this folder behind or in front of the other books and folders. Things like lotion, hand sanitizer, and lip balm may come in handy every day, so you can leave those in your backpack for the entire school year. Other items, such as scarves, mittens, umbrellas, and sunglasses, will only come in handy during certain seasons. You should leave these items out until the weather calls for it.   Instead of using full-sized lotion and hand sanitizer bottles, go for the mini travel-sized ones. You'll need to replace them more often, but you'll also save space. If you live in an unpredictable climate, then having a warm hat or an umbrella might be a good idea."

      "When you have finished picking up all of the stitches for the heel, count your total number of stitches and divide them evenly among 3 needles. You may have to have 1 less or more on one of the needles to do this. For example, if you have 84 stitches, then you can place 28 stitches onto each needle. But if you end up with 85 stitches, then 1 needle will need to have 29 stitches on it and the other 2 will have 28 stitches. When your stitches are divided evenly among the 3 needles, begin knitting in the round. This will start to form the foot section of the stocking. Knit several rounds until the foot section of your stocking is about 4 inches (10 cm) or longer. After the foot section measure about 4 inches (10 cm) from the heel, you can start to decrease the total number stitches in each round. Knit the rounds as usual, but knit 2 stitches together when you reach the last 3 stitches in the round. Then, knit 1 and repeat the round. Continue decreasing in this way until you have a total of 28 stitches. the remaining stitches. When you have 28 stitches left, bind them off. To bind off, knit the first 2 stitches in the round, then slip the first new stitch over the second new stitch. As you do this, let the first stitch to slip off the then of the needle. Then, knit 1 and slip the first stitch over the second stitch again.  Repeat this until you have worked all of the stitches off of your needles. Make sure to leave a long tail (12 inches (30 cm) or longer) so that you can use the tail yarn to weave the toe opening closed. Thread the tail yarn through the eye of the yarn needle. Then, begin sewing the opening closed. Match up the bound off stitches and sew through 2 at a time to close up the opening. When you get to the end, insert the needle into the inside of the stocking’s toe and then-then turn the stocking inside out to secure it from the inside and hide the knot.",
      "Take ¼ of your total stitches from the first double pointed needle and ¼ of your total stitches from the last double pointed needle and transfer them onto 1 needle. You will then work back and forth across this needle in rows to extend the heel section of your stocking.  For example, if you have a total of 68 stitches, then you would need to transfer 17 stitches from the first needle and 17 stitches from the last needle onto a single needle. You will not be working the rest of the stitches for a while, so you may want to secure them on the other 2 needles using end caps. These are small eraser-like cones that you can stick onto the ends of needles to ensure that your stitches stay put. Take the first stitch from your needle with all of the stitches on it and slip it onto your other needle. Then, knit to the end of the row and turn your work around. Slip the first stitch onto the empty needle. Then, purl to the end of the row. Turn your work around again. Keep working back and forth across the same row to extend the heel portion of the stocking. Repeat the last 2 rows until your heel piece measures 2.25 inches (5.7 cm). When your heel piece measures 2.25 inches (5.7 cm), start decreasing by 1 stitch each row. For the first row, slip 1 stitch over from the needle with all the stitches on it to the empty 1, and then knit until you only have 3 stitches left. Then, knit 2 stitches together for a decrease, and then knit the last stitch. Next, slip 1 stitch over to the other needle, and then purl until there are only 3 stitches left in the row.  Then, purl 2 stitches together and purl the last stitch. Repeat the last two rows in sequence for 6 more rows or a total of 8 rows. This will continue to shape the heel section of your stocking. After your 8th row, knit across the row. However, do not turn the work around when you reach the end of the row. Use the needle to pick up 12 stitches along the side of the heel section, moving downwards towards the other double pointed needle. To pick up a stitch, insert the needle through the first stitch, loop the yarn over the needle, and then pull this loop through the stitch. Repeat this process until you have picked up 12 stitches along the side of the heel section. When you finish picking up stitches, begin knitting across the other needles. Knit all the way across the other 2 needles until you reach the other side of the heel section. Pick up 12 stitches along the other side of the heel section.

      "Although it may seem obvious, it is important to understand that the first step in breaking a bad habit is developing a true desire for and committing to changing your life. Many people embark on the path of breaking a habit without being certain that they really want to change. Breaking habits is a difficult task, so if you aren't fully committed to it you are likely to fail. Most habitual behaviors are patterns that have evolved because they have been rewarded in some way. They make it easier to perform a common task, or to deal with various emotional states. A “habit loop” forms from a cue, or trigger, that tells your brain to start the habitual behavior. The brain processes a “reward” from this behavior, in the form of neurochemicals, that reinforces the habit loop. Interrupting the behavior part of this loop is how to break a habit. To determine the most effective way to break a habit, it will be helpful to determine the situational and emotional context that triggers the habit. This can help you understand what “rewards” your brain is looking for. Having this understanding will allow you to develop other, healthier means of achieving the same rewards that the bad habit provided.  Many bad habits come about as a means of dealing with situations that cause stress or boredom.  For example, for many people smoking provides a relief from stress. Procrastination temporarily provides free time to engage in more fun activities.  When you feel the urge to perform your habitual behavior, make a note of it. Often, habits have become so ingrained that we don’t even notice why we do them. Developing that awareness will help you pinpoint what is going on to prompt your habit.  When you make your note, jot down what was going on at the time. For example, if you’re a nail-biter, note whenever you feel the impulse to bite your nails. Take a few notes about how you’re feeling, what has been going on during the day, where you are, and what you were thinking. Once you understand the situation that triggers your habit and the reward you receive for engaging in the undesirable behavior, you can make a plan that involves goals for behavior change and strategies for minimizing habit triggers.  Studies show that having a clear, specific plan greatly increases your chances of success in breaking habit. It helps break down unwanted behaviors and also helps create new patterns of action.  Plan to make mistakes. Do not make a plan that will be deemed a failure as a result of a single slip-up. Most people give in to the temptation of old habits at some point while trying to break them. If you accept this in advance, you will be less likely to let negative thinking defeat the whole enterprise of breaking the habit.  You should include in your plan mechanisms for keeping yourself accountable, in the form of rewards for successes and feedback from others who support your goal of breaking the habit. You are more likely to succeed in your goal if you share it with others. More details on this are provided later in this article. In your mind, repeatedly practice breaking the habit by imagining scenarios in which you engage in desired behaviors rather than the bad habit. Imagine situations in which you would be tempted to engage in the undesired behavior and choose a better option. This helps reinforce positive behavior patterns.  For example, if your goal is to eat less junk food, imagining yourself in your kitchen preparing a healthy meal, and sitting down to eat it.  Some people find it helpful to write down \"scripts\" of their desired behavior and read them every day. Increasing your mindfulness in daily life can help you become aware of your actions, rather than functioning on “autopilot.” Mindfulness focuses on being aware of what you are experiencing in the moment, and experiencing it without avoidance or judgment. With practice, mindfulness can become a healthy habit that can counteract the bad habits you want to avoid.  Mindfulness trains your brain to respond to situations differently. It can actually “reprogram” the way you respond to situations and stressors. It can help give you time before you react to something, and decrease your tendency toward “automatic thoughts,” which arises in response to a situation.  Be conscious of when you are tempted to give in to bad habits. What are the situations that lead to the undesired behavior? What are the sensations in your body or thoughts in your mind that promote the undesired behavior? Understanding them without judging yourself will help you resist the behavior.  Don't suppress thoughts about the habit. If you try not think about something, ironically, you will start to see it everywhere and become overwhelmed.  Trying not to think about smoking, for example, could result in you becoming hypersensitive to anything that reminds you of smoking. You are much better off to recognize your craving and the situations that promote it, and deal with these issues head-on. Try mindfulness meditation. Taking a few minutes every day to become quiet and focus on your breathing will help you develop awareness of your body and your thoughts.  Yoga and Tai Chi also encourage meditation, and they’re good for your health. Note when you feel the urge to perform your habit, but don’t judge those thoughts. You could try saying something like, “I’m feeling the urge to smoke right now” or “I really want to bite my fingernails at the moment.” Acknowledging your feelings will help you move past them without getting stuck on the thoughts.",
      "Research suggests that sometimes our environments can cue us to perform certain behaviors, even if we're actively trying to stop. Breaking a habit, then, is partially a matter of reducing situational triggers until you can develop new ways of dealing with them.  Novel situations promote more use of the parts of your brain that are geared toward consciously making decisions, rather than slipping into automatic behavior patterns.  A good way to avoid bad habits is to find a way to change your scenery and see if your bad habit becomes less tempting. For instance, if you like to smoke out on your patio, remove the chair you sit in and replace it with a plant. If you tend to overeat at the same location at the dining room table, move to a different seat or rearrange your furniture such that you're facing a different direction than usual when you eat. Subtle changes to the environment can make a habit less rote and force your mind to reassess what's happening.  Forge relationships with people who support your desired behavior. You don't need to ditch your old friends entirely, but finding some new ones who live the way you want to can help minimize triggers.  Go on vacation, if you can. One of the most effective ways to break old habits is put yourself in a completely new situation for a while, and develop new, healthier habits that you can then transplant into your normal life when you return. If you can create obstacles that make the habit more difficult or unpleasant to engage in than some other course of action, this can help you break the routines that have reinforced this habit in the past. Here are a few suggestions:  Tell supportive people about your plan to break your habit, and invite them to call you out on your slip-ups. This will create consequences for succumbing to temptation.  Or, even better, find someone else who wants to break the same habit as you, and quit together, keeping each other accountable.  Anything you can do to break up the sequence of events that normally leads to the undesirable behavior is also a good idea. For example, if you are trying to stop smoking, keep your cigarettes in another room. If you are trying to stop logging on to Facebook during working hours, disconnect the internet or use one of the available apps that blocks access to sites like this. Even though these obstacles can be easily overcome, they are sometimes enough to break up the behavior pattern that leads to the unwanted behavior.  Create small \"punishments\" for lapses. For example, you can use the same rationale behind a swear jar: every time you slip back into the habit, put a dollar (or more) in a can or jar. Set an amount that you'll hate to cough up whenever you give into the urge, and stick to it. When you've successfully kicked the habit, spend the money on a reward or donate it to a charitable cause. Or, if you are trying to stop overeating, add 10 minutes to your workout every time you overeat. A punishment related to the behavior will probably be most effective. Some habits, such as procrastinating, can be difficult to change because the solution seems so daunting. “Stop procrastinating” can seem such a big task that you wouldn’t be able to do it. Try splitting up your goals into small, achievable steps. You will get the “reward” of seeing success sooner, and your brain is less likely to resist your ultimate goal as “too big” to accomplish. Instead of saying “I’ll stop eating junk food,” say, “I’ll eat a healthy breakfast.” Instead of saying “I’ll go to the gym more often,” say, “I’ll go to yoga on Saturday mornings.” As you find success in those small steps, increase them to meet your ultimate goal.  For example, instead of saying “I’ll stop procrastinating today,” set yourself a goal of “I will stay focused on my work for 30 minutes today.” The highly popular “Pomodoro method” can help you. Use a timer and set yourself a block of time in which you will focus on your work without doing anything else. Make this block short, no longer than 45 minutes. It can be as short as 20. The goal is to set yourself a task that’s reasonable and achievable.  After you’ve finished that block, take a little break! Do something fun, surf Facebook, check your texts. Then, set yourself another block. This type of technique can “trick” your brain into setting new, good habits because you see immediate success (something your brain likes). Because habits are created when a behavior is rewarded in some way, a great way to create new habits is to reward yourself for good behavior.  The most successful reward will be one that comes immediately after the desired behavior, and which is something you genuinely want or enjoy. For example, if you are trying to break the habit of being late for work, you could reward yourself with a cup of gourmet coffee each day you arrive on time, until the reward is no longer needed. Try to replace your habit with something new and positive in your life.  The key is to have a plan for an alternative action to take when tempted to engage in a bad habit.   For instance, if you're trying to stop smoking, eat a sucker, do breathing exercises, or walk around the block when you would usually light up. Filling the void left by your old habit with another activity will help you avoid backsliding. Try to make sure the alternative action isn't boring or unappealing. If you can make your new habit something you actually want to do, something you enjoy, or something that results in some obvious (and ideally immediate) positive outcome, it will be easier to make the switch. Behavioral conditioning is a long process, and breaking a habit takes time, so you have to stick with it. Be patient and kind with yourself.  Conventional wisdom and self-help books have suggested that it takes 28 days to break a habit. The reality is more complicated, as recent studies have suggested that how long the process takes depends on both the individual and the habit, and can range from as few as 18 days or as many as 245.  Even though this process varies between individuals, it is probably safe to say that the first few days will be the hardest. Some neuroscientists suggest people go through a \"withdrawal\" period during the first two weeks, as our nervous systems struggle to deal a change in the chemicals triggering the \"reward\" centers of our brains. Telling yourself you can't do something is a bad cognitive habit that will reinforce your belief that you can’t. Remember: being harsh on yourself for having a hard time or lapsing isn’t helpful to you, and it can make bad habits worse.  If you notice that you’re criticizing yourself, remember that things that seem contradictory can coexist. For example, imagine that you want to break the habit of eating junk food, but you “gave in” and had a bag of chips with lunch. It could be easy to beat yourself up for this. However, being kind to yourself acknowledges your lapse and recognizes that this isn’t failure. You don’t have to continue giving in because you gave in once. Try adding and to your statements and creating positive plans for the next time you face a challenge. For example: “I had that bag of chips with lunch. I’m upset with myself for that, and I can help myself by packing snacks to take to work so the vending machines don’t tempt me.” You can also add the word \"but\" and follow it up with a positive statement, e.g. \"I totally screwed up, BUT everybody makes mistakes sometimes.\""

      "Stick your finger into the soil—if the first inch or several centimeters feel dry, water your plant until the soil is moist. Check the soil every day for dryness. How often you need to water the plant may fluctuate based on the temperature, season, and humidity.  Water your ficus immediately after planting or whenever you notice the top layer of soil drying out. During spring or summertime, fill a spray bottle with water and mist the ficus’s leaves daily. your plant 1-2 times a month during the spring and summer. During warmer seasons, spray a fertilizer over your ficus tree once every 2-4 weeks. In colder seasons, cut back to fertilizing the plant once monthly.  Avoid fertilizing your plant more than once a month in winter when the tree is dormant. Diluted liquid fertilizers work best with ficus plants. If your ficus leaves look dusty, dip a washcloth or sponge in lukewarm water. Gently wipe the surface of the leaves to keep them glossy and lustrous. Do not use dish soap or other cleaners to clean your ficus. the ficus in spring and early autumn. Use pruning shears or loppers to cut back excessive growth or deadwood. Avoid pruning near the tree trunk, which can damage your plant. Prune either before or after winter, the tree's dormant season.",
      "Your ficus needs well-draining soil, preferably peat mix, to prevent it from becoming waterlogged. Add soil until the pot is about 1/4 to 1/2 of the way full—you will fill it up completely as you transplant the ficus.  You can buy well-draining soil mixes at most nurseries or garden centers. Check the packaging for \"well-draining\" or ask an employee for assistance. To check soil drainage, dig a 1 foot (0.30 m) hole into the dirt and fill it with water. If the soil drains completely within 5-15 minutes, it is well-draining soil.  Make sure that the new pot also has a few holes in the bottom to aid drainage. Use your hands to loosen the root ball as much as you can without breaking it. This will help the ficus absorb more water and nutrients when you transplant it and adapt better to its new container. Position the ficus tree upright into the pot. Fill the rest of the pot with soil until you reach the soil level of the plant's original level. Don't make your soil level any higher than the original container, which can suffocate the roots. Ficus trees prefer temperatures of around 60–75 °F (16–24 °C), or around room temperature. They also prefer bright, but not direct, sunlight. Whether you place your ficus tree indoors or outdoors, choose a spot with with moderate temperatures and lighting. Avoid spots with sudden temperature changes or cold drafts. Near a closed window, for example, is better than by an open door.",
      "This is your ficus tree's strongest season—in winter, spring, and fall, your ficus tree may be less adaptable. If you can wait until spring to replant your plant, leave the plant in its current pot until then.  Most ficus varieties thrive best if you repot them about once a year. Indoor ficus trees are generally more adaptable to repotting, even if the season isn’t ideal. Pot-bound plants are more prone to developing diseases or becoming starved of nutrients. If you notice any of the following signs, repot your plant as soon as you can:  Stunted foliage growth Roots growing through the drainage holes Weak or wilting foliage Instead of tugging on the ficus, squeeze both sides of the container and turn it upside down. Tap the bottom of the pot until you loosen the plant and pull it out gently at the base.  Tugging on the ficus tree can damage or remove its leaves and flowers. Have a friend stand near the upside down ficus to catch it if it falls out of the pot. Inspect your plant's root system after you pull it out and transplant it a pot with the same depth. This will give your plant enough room to adapt without constricting the root system. If your plant's root system is too large, you can also cut back up to 20% of the root system.  Trim along the outer areas of the plant's root system to keep the center roots intact and avoid cutting too much. Ficus plants prefer to be root-bound in their pots.  Avoid choosing a pot that is significantly larger than the root system, as this can stunt the plant's growth. Place a 1 in (2.5 cm) layer of small rocks into the new pot. This will aid the pot in water drainage and prevent soggy soil. You can buy rocks suitable for plant containers at most garden centers or nurseries."

      "The second you know that someone in your home has the flu, you should contact your pediatrician and let them know. Your pediatrician will be able to give you great information about how you can limit the chance of your little one catching the flu from someone at home. If you or someone else in your home catches the flu, ask your doctor about prescribing you antiviral medication. Antiviral medication can decrease the severity and longevity of the flu virus. The less time you’re sick, the lower the chance your infant may catch the flu from you.  Antivirals work best if taken within 2 days of getting sick. You can take antivirals, like Tamiflu, while breastfeeding. Tamiflu can be used in infants as young as two weeks old to treat the flu. Some antiviral medications can also be used to help reduce the chance of getting the flu in people over 1 year old. your baby’s bottles. While sterilizing your baby’s bottles is a good policy normally, it’s extremely important during flu season. This especially important if you travel outside the home with your infant, as flu germs could live on objects for several hours at a time. By sterilizing your baby’s bottles, you’ll limit the chance of them catching the flu. You can also wash and disinfect your baby’s toys and other supplies they often come into contact with. Whether you have the flu or not, you should make it a habit to cover yourself when you cough or sneeze. The best way to do this is with a clean tissue. Afterwards, you should discard the tissue and wash your hands.",
      "As a rule, most babies should stay out of the public for their first two months of life. This should be extended when it comes to flu season. During flu season, the more your baby is at home, the lower their chance of catching the flu.  Stay away from places with lots of people like the mall, grocery stores, or entertainment venues.  If possible, keep your child home from daycare if a lot of children in your area have the flu. Only take your child out in public if necessary. Regardless of who it is, you should forbid sick people from coming into contact with your infant unless absolutely necessary. By establishing a “no sick” policy, you’ll help protect your infant from catching the flu. Ultimately, while you might alienate a few people, you’ll safeguard your baby’s health. Stay 6 feet (1.8 m) away from people who are sick or displaying flu symptoms By using a sling or confining your baby to a carrier, you’ll shield and protect them from germs and from people who may try to touch them. This is important, as many people like to touch the hands, face, and feet of infants. If your baby confined, they won’t be able to get close enough to do so.",
      "As soon as the seasonal flu vaccine is made available, you and other caregivers should visit your doctor and get vaccinated. By being vaccinated, you’ll protect yourself from being infected. As a result, your chance of infecting your infant will be much lower. Without a flu vaccine, you and your family will be much more vulnerable.  Everyone who lives in your home or visits your home or infant should be vaccinated. You can get a flu vaccine from your doctor, through your work, or even at a neighborhood pharmacy. Flu vaccines are usually available starting in September. You can even get vaccinated while you are pregnant, so speak to your doctor about obtaining a flu shot. Typically, infants six months or older can get a flu vaccine. Getting the flu vaccine may dramatically lower their risk of catching the flu. However, infants younger than six months cannot get a vaccine. Talk to your doctor about whether a vaccine is appropriate for your child. Breastfeeding helps transfer a mother’s antibodies to her baby. As a result, breastfeeding can potentially bolster your infant’s immune system so they can better resist or fight off the flu. If you can’t breastfeed, talk to your child’s pediatrician about steps you can take to build your child’s immunity to things like the flu virus. While you should always provide your baby with proper nutrition, it is even more important during flu season. Good nutrition will bolster your infant’s immune system. In the end, they’ll be able to resist or fight off the flu a lot more effectively. Most commercially produced formula provides the nutrition infants need.  If you breastfeed, produce your own formula, or feed your baby solids, make sure your infant is receiving enough vitamin A, C, D, E, and B as well as calcium, iron, and zinc. Talk to your pediatrician if you are unsure if your baby is getting their nutritional needs met. It’s important to clean and disinfect your home on a regular basis to eliminate germs that cause the flu. Choose a disinfectant formulated especially for killing cold and flu viruses, such as a spray or disposable wipes. Clean hard surfaces, like countertops, tables, faucets, light switches, and remote controls with the disinfectant. Wash blankets, towels, stuffed animals and other soft surfaces in hot water with non-chlorine bleach to rid those items of germs. Purchase alcohol-based hand sanitizer. After you've touched a door handle or something else in a public area, use it. In addition, use it again before you touch your infant as well as your phone or other gadgets that you use often."

      "If an idea captures your and won't let go you've got to pursue it. Great artists don't worry if it will sell, if it fits current artistic trends, or will take a long time to make. Great artists jump into their passions with open arms, trusting themselves to make it work. If you want a unique, refreshing artistic voice, then you need to trust your voice. It can be hard to embark on a project that feels weird, new, and experimental. But remember -- if you can't get passionate about the project, how can you expect your audience to feel passionately about it? There is a reason burgeoning painters spend time sculpting, and vice versa. All forms of art are intrinsically linked, and they share similar vocabulary and skills (color, shading, composition, etc.). By pushing yourself to approach art differently, you open yourself up to a wealth of new influences, techniques, and styles.  Push yourself to get out of your comfort zone -- this is often where you make the biggest breakthroughs and personal discoveries. This includes other forms of art, such as writing and music. Creative expression, whether with a paintbrush or a piccolo, is about getting your ideas out of your head and into the audiences. The medium you use to do that doesn't matter. Great artists are often great readers, using books and literature to push themselves to new ideas and philosophies. They are unashamed of their past, no matter what it is, and are confident using it for motivation and inspiration. Furthermore, great artists rarely say \"no.\" They keep their minds open to everything, becoming a sponge of influences that come together to make something incredibly unique, and incredibly you. For most artists, art is a form of communication. You create art because you want to share it with other people. Otherwise, you could just leave the ideas in your head. Exactly how you want to show your work and to who is your choice. You could try to get your work shown in galleries and put up for sale. You could try getting published. You might be more comfortable putting your work online and possibly selling prints of it. Or maybe you would rather just frame some of your best work and hang it up in your home for your family and friends to enjoy.  Ask for honest critiques, and try to accept them with grace. You will never catch everything, and your audience's opinion will help find areas to improve in. Ask people what they think about the art, and what it might mean. Does it match up with your own thoughts and ideas? Did you accomplish your goals with the piece? Could you better communicate them your goals, or are you happy with ambiguity and differing opinions? Constructive criticism is designed to help you improve your artwork, either the piece you're working on now or your future works. A person giving constructive criticism will usually point out both the flaws and the strengths in your piece and make suggestions on how you could fix the flaws. While it isn't always fun to hear, criticism is something you're going to have to deal with as an artist. Learn to identify when a criticism of your work is valid and use that information to focus on correcting your mistakes.",
      "Saying, \"I want to be a masterful painter,\" is a noble goal, but it is so broad it is hard to know where to start. Successful practice in any art form requires mastery of the smaller skills, almost all of which can be practiced independently of each other:   Painters must master drawing and sketching, color blending, shading, brush techniques, and composition.  Drawers and Illustrators need to draw, shade, color, and compose, and may want to learn the basics of digital illustration and animation.  Sculptors: Often learn a wide variety of techniques and materials, from ceramic to metalworking, and must be able to sketch and draft ideas on paper. Advanced study in your material and tools of choice, including more scientific research, is highly recommended.  Video Artists: Need to be fluent across the set, from lighting, audio, camera operation, and editing. Skill drawing (for storyboards) and animating are a big plus. Humans improve much faster through daily effort, and even 10 minutes a day can be better than 2 hours once a week. Find a way to make art part of your everyday routine, prioritizing it highly on your schedule. If you can't find time to make art every day, being a good artist will be exponentially harder.  Give yourself a cue each day to make things easier -- first thing in the morning, after dinner, before you exercise, etc. Coupling habits together makes them much easier to stick to. Reward yourself slightly after each session -- maybe you don't eat dessert until done, or go for a run once the page is finished. Tie a good feeling to your daily art practice. Missing days is okay -- it happens. Instead of beating yourself up or punishing yourself with more work the next day, just get back on track. Art should be fun, not punishment! Not all practice sessions are equally beneficial. Every artist has areas and skills that they aren't very good at, and the best artists run to these areas in practice. Remember, this isn't always about making a publishable piece. Once you give yourself the freedom to practice things you're bad at, you'll notice yourself making much faster improvements in all areas of your art.  Mindful practice is about finding mistakes and fixing them in order to improve. If you don't let yourself make mistakes, how could you ever improve. There is a difference between \"practice\" and \"performance.\" Once you realize that your sketchbooks and studies are there to help you get better, not to share with others, you can use them practice making your next \"real\" piece of art even better. A study is simply a test run of some aspect of your piece. For example, a sculptor doing a full length human body likely wouldn't launch into the replica without knowing her materials, style, and logistical concerns beforehand. To prepare, she might start studies in the following areas. Note that, though sculpture is the example, all good artists test before beginning:   Difficult or unusual sections: Hands are complex organs with many moving joints and bones. Practicing a few hands and figuring out how they will be held, is best done before adding them to the final sculpture  Logistic/Technical concerns: How is the sculpture going to stand up without falling? What base is being used, and how is the sculpture attached?  Stylistic Elements: If it is a melancholic or sad sculpture, how do you plan to capture that sadness? Smaller sculptures and sketching facial expressions will help figure it out. You could also try to replicate similar pieces or emotions. Say you love to make impressionist, brightly-colored portraits in the style of Vincent Van Gogh, or abstract, cubist paintings like Picasso. While neither of them look like anything you could ever see in real life, both men are masters of realistic portraiture. You need to know the rules before you can break them, and the ability to perfectly replicate what you see in front of you is the best technical exercise you can perform. Try out:  Sketching or drawing still landscapes Capturing the human body realistically, both still and in motion. Replicating your favorite paintings or works of art, teaching yourself the techniques of the masters.",
      "Every artist needs a portfolio -- the place where potential buyers or clients can see your work. Luckily, the internet is making it easy as website design spaces like Wix.com, SquareSpace, and Wordpress all have templates designed for artists portfolios. All you have to do is customize the name, color, and bio, then import images or videos of your art.  Purchase a custom domain name if you are looking for professional clients. A site like www.MyPortfolio.wordpress.com looks much less professional than www.MyPortfolio.com. When done, attach this portfolio to all your social media accounts to make it easy to find. Consider printing (or drawing/designing, for memorable flair) some business cards to get the word around. Contact small galleries near you to see if you can put some work up. Look into that restaurant or coffee shop that puts work on the walls. And, if all else fails, throw your own art show. All you need is a space to hang everything, some refreshments, and friends willing to come and support you.  Try to host shows with multiple artists when possible. That way, everyone brings their own friend groups so each artist can meet new fans. You never know if you can display your work unless you ask. Don't be intimidated -- they absolute worst thing that happens is the word, \"no.\" Consider hosting \"open studio\" session once a month, where friends and curious spectators can watch you work and talk about your process. Few, if any, artists are so skilled that they can't benefit from some kind of formal instruction. Art classes can help you get past problems with your work that you haven't been able to solve on your own, identify areas in which you could improve, or just give you some direction and a regular time to devote to working on art. There are courses available for all skill levels at colleges, community centers, local arts centers, and numerous other places.  Your teacher and fellow students are essential contacts as you build your career. They can point to new opportunities, team up with you for shows, and support your work in the difficult early years when you're still unknown. Never discount a connection or friend. In the word-of-mouth driven art scene, a wide, strong social network is king. It isn't always a ton of fun, but it is absolutely essential if you intend to be a professional. No one wants to champion your art but you. And, in its own way, this is a good thing-- you no longer have to hope the \"right\" person shows up in your gallery. Instead, hard work online can get your work into many corners of the internet, and even make some money.  If you make smaller, sellable art pieces, consider a shop on Etsy or eBay. Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest, with their large pictures and big art networks, are great places to share and see work. Pick 1-2 social media accounts to run and stick with those. Trying to work on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. all at once is impossible to do well without spending all day on the internet. Artists need to stick together, and many of the greats have come from collectives and groups. It is no mistake that many famous artists knew each other before striking it big, and some of the greatest moments in art (Paris in the 40's, NY in the 80's) come from shared creative communities. So go to local shows, enroll in classes, and collaborate with other artists. A rising tide carries all boats, so get out there and make some waves.  If you're struggling to find a community, look online. There are tons of forums, sites, and communities (like the famous DeviantArt) that allow you to showcase work.  Pay attention to your contemporaries, supporting their own shows and work. When you are first starting out, your best network will be artists in the same situation. If you don't make art a daily priority, then it's going to be really hard to be a good artist. That is just the reality of practice-- all the talent in the world doesn't help if you don't sit down and make art. Honestly, this may require some sacrifices in terms of work hours, salary, and living situation. But if you want to be a professional artist, none of this should matter. You get to make art every single day! Always remember, especially in the early years of practice, that all of your favorite artists went through the same process."

      "Oxytocin treatments during labor aren't safe for everyone. If you and your doctor are discussing the possibility of using oxytocin, talk to them about any health conditions or concerns you have, as well as any medications you're currently taking. For example, oxytocin may be unsafe for you if: You have kidney or heart problems You have a latex allergy You are taking certain other medications that might intensify the effects of the oxytocin, such as prostaglandins",
      "Say things like “I love you” to those you care about more often. Oxytocin not only contributes to feelings of empathy and compassion (two key components of love), it is also boosted when you verbally express these sentiments.  Similarly, tell friends and others in your life that you appreciate them by saying things like, \"I'm really glad we met,\" or \"It's great to have you in my life.\" Statements such as these will often lead to positive exchanges that give you both an increase in oxytocin. Touch of all sorts releases oxytocin into your brain, but different types of touch give bigger boosts. Hugs are especially powerful oxytocin boosters, especially when you're hugging someone you care about. Accordingly, get in the habit of hugging any loved ones you live with every day.  When meeting people in informal situations, consider suggesting a hug instead of a handshake. There is a considerable difference in the amount of oxytocin each of these acts will release. Massages are another way to boost oxytocin through touch. Hire a massage therapist or ask a loved one to give you a massage. Hugging is great, but an orgasm will usually give you an especially potent boost of oxytocin. This release of oxytocin can calm you down and it also increases feelings of trust between you and your partner. Simply imagining physical contact such as hugging or cuddling someone can give you a boost in oxytocin. This will be more effective when you imagine touching someone you have a physical and loving relationship with.",
      "Aside from countless other health benefits associated with meditation, you can give yourself an oxytocin boost by focusing on positive thoughts about someone. To do so, sit down somewhere quiet and free of distraction. Close your eyes and simply think complimentary or hopeful things about one person in particular. You may even want to focus on one mantra, such as “Sebastian is wonderful.” Simply repeat this thought to yourself over and over, while pushing away any other thoughts that arise. The oxytocin boosts associated with physical contact are not limited to contact with other humans. In fact, another surefire way to increase your oxytocin levels is by petting a dog. Always ask before petting a stranger's dog, of course. Note that you may find yourself talking to the person as well—you are more likely to have positive social interactions with the people around you when a dog is around. You can get massive oxytocin spikes by participating in moderately stressful activities. This is especially true when you share such an experience with other people. Classic examples include activities like riding a roller coaster or skydiving.  By experiencing something exhilarating together, you are quickly bonded to those around you. This occurs in part because of a flood of oxytocin released by your brain after an activity that feels dangerous. In fact, any sort of “adventure” with someone else can boost both of your oxytocin levels. Even a walk around the block with someone will have positive effects on your brain chemistry, as well as your feelings towards one another. If you're on your own and looking for an oxytocin boost, audio can help. Whether you put on some relaxing music or sing along to your favorite tune, both will positively affect your brain chemistry. Giving time or money to another person or organization can boost your oxytocin too. In short, being more generous will wind up making you feel more appreciated. Positive feedback loops form when people work together for a common interest and are grateful for one another's contributions.",
      "Make eye contact during conversation and otherwise give your full attention to the person you are speaking with. Keep your phone out of sight, square your body towards the person you are listening to, and indicate that you are listening with nonverbal cues like nodding. When you receive positive comments, you get an immediate oxytocin boost. In fact, any sentiments associated with giving or receiving love and admiration will increase your oxytocin levels. Meanwhile, people tend to exchange positive sentiments with those who feel favorably about them.  Get in the habit of saying positive things to other people when they come to mind. Not only will you give them an oxytocin boost, you'll make them feel more comfortable speaking affectionately towards you as well. People are increasingly using online tools such as social media websites to interact with one another. While it's important to balance online interaction with face-to-face interaction, you can get a boost in oxytocin by exchanging pleasantries online. Next time you get on Facebook, for instance, make a point of liking at least 10 posts and make a handful of positive, friendly comments on friends' posts. Eating with another person is a proven way to bond. It can also calm you down and provide the opportunity for conversation. Ideally, invite someone to join you for lunch or dinner and offer to cover the tab. Giving and receiving also boost oxytocin levels."

      "Using Other Phrases",
      "Saying \"Take Care\" In French"
    ],
    "document": [
      "\" Translating literally as \"watch/look out\" or \"take heed,\" this phrase is a bit less friendly than \"prends soin de toi\" As such, it is a great way to say goodbye to acquaintances or to interchange with \"prends soin de toi\" when you're looking for new vocabulary. Fais is pronouced \"fays,\" and faites is pronounced \"fehts.\"  Singular/Informal: Fais attention à toi → Look out (for yourself). Plural/Formal: Faites attention à vous → Look out (for yourself).  \"Fais attention!\" is also used to warn people of danger, both in speech and on road signs. You do pronounce the \"s\" at the end of the first word, since \"attention\" starts with a vowel. If you're saying \"take care\" to help someone get better or work through an issue or tough time, you have several other phrases at your disposal. Try out:   Tout le meilleur (Too leh meh-uhr) → All the best  Bonne chance (Bon shan-ce) → Good luck  Avoir la bonne santé (Av-war leh bun san-teh) → Have good health (clumsy, never used by french people, should be avoided)  Meilleurs vœux (Meh-uhr vo-eh) → I send my best wishes. \" If \"take care\" is how you sign off on a conversation, there are other options. Some similar phrases include:   À bientôt (ah bee-en-toe) → See you soon  À plus tard (ah ploo tar) → Until later (you can drop the \"tard\" for a less formal goodbye)  Je m’en vais (je men vase) → I’m outta here Because the expression is relatively new in French, it is still a little weird when it is used for letters, coming across as unprofessional and unlearned. Instead, use phrases like:   Bien à toi/Meilleurs voeux (Bee-en ah twah/Meh-uhr vo-eh) → Best wishes  Amitiés (Ahm-ee-teh) → Sincerely, Kindest regards  Avec beaucoup d'amour (Ah-vek bow-coo dam-or) → With lots of love  Grosses bises(Gross beez) → With love and kisses",
      "This is the informal, singular way to say \"take care\" in French. As such, it is only useful for talking to one person who you are familiar with. Warning: this is very rarely used and you will sound clumsy, awkward. To avoid this, add \"de toi\" at the end of the sentence (pronounced \"deh touah\") Pronounced \"pron swan.\" It sounds bit like a stereotypical French accent saying the English name \"Bronson.\" Try to barely pronounce the final \"n\" sound in soin. \"Prenez\" is the vous form of \"prendre,\" which means \"to take.\" The vous form is for second-person plural (\"you all\") and for the formal tense (anyone you would call \"sir, \"ma'am,\" \"Mr,\" or \"Mrs\"). You can use \"prenez soin\" just like you would use the English expression \"take care:\" It is more common to add \"de vous\" at the end of the sentence: \"prenez soin\" sound really weird. Pronounced \"pren-eh swan (deh vou)\" To be extra native sounding, you want a gravelly, guttural sound with the \"n' in prenez, like a stereotypical French accent. This is a simple and easy way to spice up your dialogue. Simply go from \"prenez soin de vous\" meaning \"take care,\" to \"prenez bien soin de vous\" meaning \"take good care.\" The change is subtle, but you can use it to mix up your phrases. \"Bien\" is pronounced bee-en \" The de allows you to add a person, place, or thing, changing the expression to \"take care of ________.\" For example, \"prends soin de ma mère\" means \"take care of my mom.\" You'll need to conjugate prendre to make the phrase work, changing the verb depending on who you're talking to. Though it is irregular, it is an easy conjugation:   Je Prends  Tu Prends  Il/elle/on Prend  Nous Prenons  Vous Prenez  Ils/Elles Prennent \" Just like in English, this is the longer version of the full goodbye. You'll need to conjugate the verb \"prendre,\" of course, to fit the subject of the person you're talking, as well as the subject.   Informal: \"Prends bien soin de toi.\" Translates literally as \"take good care of yourself.\"  Formal or Plural: \"Prenez bien soin de vous.\" Translates literally as \"take good care of yourself/yourselves.\" To convert \"take care\" into a question, simply add \"est-ce que\" and the subject. You end up with \"Est-ce que tu prends (bien) soin de toi?\" which translates to \"Do you take (good) care of yourself?\"  Est-ce que is pronounced \"es-suh-kuh.\" You can also use inversion to ask questions in French: \"prends-tu bien soin de toi?\""

      "Taking out a Screw with a Stripped Head"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Screw extractors are designed to help you remove broken screws. You can find them at home improvement stores for relatively cheap, and they will make the process easier. Screw extractors work best on screws with stripped threads and/or broken heads. Pick a bit smaller than the screw. Drill a hole down the center. If it won't drill, try using a smaller bit instead, such as a 1⁄16 inch (1.6 mm) bit. Be gentle and go slowly, as you don't want to break the bit off in the screw head. Push the extractor into the hole you've just drilled. Push down on it as hard as you can, and then use a hammer to tap it fully into the hole. As you push down on the extractor, use your drill or a screwdriver to turn the extractor counterclockwise. The threads of the extractor should catch in the screw, allowing you to twist it out. If it doesn't work, try tapping the extractor in harder, or apply a lubricant like Liquid Wrench to the screw. Let the lubricant sit for 30 minutes before trying to remove the screw. To remove a screw without a head, you can simply grasp the end of the shank with pliers. Turn the pliers to release the screw from the material, and pull out the screw.",
      "Sometimes, if you go up or down a size in your screwdriver, you can get the screw head to catch, even if it is mostly stripped. You can also switch to a flat head instead of a Phillips. If it doesn't turn on the first try, move on to the next size. You don't want to further damage the screw head. Cut a large rubber band so you have a flat long piece instead of a circle. Lay the rubber band over the screw head, and then try to take the screw out with a screwdriver. The rubber gives it extra grip, helping you remove the screw. Sometimes, a rusted screw will bond with nearby materials. Spraying or pouring a chemical over the screw, such as liquid wrench, oven cleaner, soda (like Coke or Pepsi), or even lemon juice can dissolve those bonds. Spray or pour it in, and let it sit for 10 minutes before checking it. You may need to reapply it several times or even wait a day for the chemical to do its magic. Drip a bit of superglue on the screw head. Place the bit or screwdriver on the head. Let the glue dry, then try removing the screw by pressing down on the screw and twisting it out. If the screw top is completely stripped, use a rotary cutter to slice a small strip across the top. Pull the screw out with a flat head screwdriver or bit. If nothing seems to work, use bits to demolish the screw. For instance, you can use a large bit to drill down into the screw, essentially destroying it. You can also use a bit to take the head of the screw off and then pull the shank out with pliers."

      "Preparing Fresh Amla",
      "Using Amla Powder"
    ],
    "document": [
      "A pinch of sea salt or Himalayan pink salt atop the fruit will bring out its sweetness and add depth. It also takes away some of the sour notes of the amla.  You do not need to peel the amla before slicing and eating it. Find fresh amla at an Indian grocery store when it's in season from December to April or order it from an online retailer. Slice the amla and lightly toss the slices with lemon juice and salt. Set the slices on a plate outside in direct sunlight for a few days until they’re completely dry.  Thinner slices will dry faster than thicker ones. You can use a food dehydrator if you have one instead of setting the slices in the sun. Bring water to a boil in a saucepan. Place the amla in the water with a pinch of turmeric and salt to taste. Let the fruit cook until it’s soft before removing from the heat.  Cutting small slits in the fruit before you boil it will let it soak up the turmeric and salt better. If you like amla a little crunchier, cook it for less time. The saltiness of the pickling neutralizes some of the bitterness of the fruit. Soak the amla in a brine in the refrigerator, making sure the brine completely covers the fruit to keep it preserved.  Serve it over rice or dal, which is an Indian lentil dish. Pickled amla has the same detoxifying benefits as kimchi, which is fermented cabbage. It helps improve digestion and eliminate waste and toxins from your body. Typically, amla chutney contains ingredients like cilantro, green chiles, ginger, garlic, and sea salt. Treat it like a salsa and use it to top steamed vegetables, meat or tofu, or rice. Buy it from a grocer or make it yourself at home.  Look for chutneys that have less preservatives and added chemicals. Chutney is also served with traditional Indian foods like idlis, dosas, and kebabs.",
      "The anti-inflammatory properties help your body digest food better throughout the day. Stir amla powder into a glass of water and drink it on an empty stomach when you first wake up.  Add lemon juice and honey for a more palatable flavor. You can buy premade amla juices. However, many of the ones you’ll find at the store have added sugar and chemicals. Putting amla powder on bananas, apple slices, or melons will disguise the bitterness of the gooseberries. Plus, you’ll get all the vitamins and fiber from the additional serving of fruit. Avoid putting amla powder on citrus or tart fruits like oranges, grapefruit, or pineapple. They will just enhance the sourness of the amla. Amla has tons of benefits, but it doesn’t exactly taste great. To avoid the sour bitterness, take 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of honey combined with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of amla powder. The sweetness of the honey disguises the amla.  This mixture is also known to help clear up congestion and cure colds. Use raw honey. Because it hasn’t been pasteurized, it has more nutritional benefits than regular honey. One of the best and easiest ways to disguise the tart taste of amla is to mix it into a smoothie. Start with your usual ingredients like bananas, almond milk, spinach, and ice, then add a dash of the powder before you blend it.  Pour your smoothie into a bowl instead of a cup for a trendy smoothie bowl. Top it with more fruit, shaved coconut, or granola. The amla powder will give your smoothie a slight brown hue."

      "You’re probably hilarious, so it might not mean anything when your friend laughs at your best jokes. But if someone laughs at every joke you tell, even the ones you know aren’t that great, it might mean that they’re into you. . If you want to test the water on this one, try telling a joke that you know is corny, then watch to see whether your friend laughs. If your friend is crushing on you, they’re going to notice everything good about you, from the way you look to how hard you studied for your history test. If you notice them giving you way more compliments than usual, they might be into you. Some people are just complimentary in general, so don’t read too much into a single comment. Remembering unimportant facts about you is a good indicator your friend is into you. If your friend is crushing on you, they’ll be paying attention to almost everything you say.  If you mention you love Skittles, for instance, and your friend brings it up a few weeks later, they might like you. Your friend might just have a good memory, so it doesn’t necessarily mean they have a crush. It’s natural to want to be helpful, especially when you like someone. If your friend is constantly offering to do little things for you, they might be wishing they were more than just a friend.  Helpful gestures don’t have to be a big deal. For instance, your friend might offer to grab you a bottle of water because you forgot to get a drink. If you think your friend has a crush on you, don’t take advantage of their desire to help you. This will make you seem insensitive and uncaring. Your friend might bring up the subject of your last crush or try to guess who you like as a way of testing the waters. If you say you don’t like anyone in particular right now, they might feel like they have a chance with you.  If your friend likes you, they might act jealous or annoyed if you are crushing on someone else, or they might get very quiet if the subject of your dating life comes up. Your friend will probably not mention having crushes on other people if they like you. Your mutual friends will probably be able to pick up on what’s going on, even if the other person hasn’t explicitly said that they like you.  Try saying something like, \"I've noticed Steph is acting a little different towards me lately. Do you think it's because she likes me?\" While you may be able to get some good feedback from another friend, the person may not be sure, or they may not want to get involved in the situations.",
      "If your friend is crushing on you, their body language will probably be more open, and they will usually stand with their body turned towards yours, even in a group.  If your friend has a relaxed posture, with their torso facing towards you, it’s a sign that they feel at ease. It may mean they like you or it may just mean they are comfortable being around you. Watch for signs that your friend's posture has changed around you. For instance, if they normally act relaxed, but now they seem stiff, it may be a sign that they are nervous because they have a crush on you. If your friend usually has their arms crossed or they stand with their body turned away from you any time you're around, they may not be crushing on you. However, if they only act closed off every once in awhile, it might mean they are talking to someone else or are busy. Eye contact is one of the most universal methods of flirting. If you’re hanging out with your friend and you notice they’re looking into your eyes, it may be a sign that they’re interested in you.  Some eye contact is natural during a conversation, so pay attention to whether your friend makes more eye contact with you than with other people. If your friend smiles at you before they break eye contact, it may be a sign that they're interested. If you want to show your friend that you like them, too, smile back!  If you notice that your friend is suddenly making more eye contact than usual, or out of the blue they won't meet your gaze, it may be a sign that they've started to see you as a romantic interest. If a person is crushing on you, they’ll often play with their hair, touch their lips, or rest their fingertips on their collarbone. This is usually a subconscious gesture that indicates attraction. If your friend usually shows up in sweatpants and an old t-shirt every time you hang out, but suddenly starts dressing like they’re ready for a night out when you’re around, it might be a sign that they want to look better in order to impress you. When a person has a crush, they often subconsciously mirror the other person's behavior. If you notice that your friend touches their face or crosses their legs whenever you do, it could be a signal that they are especially tuned in to whatever you are doing. If you and your friend regularly give each other hugs, you should be able to tell if they’re lingering with their arms around you longer than they normally do. This is a good sign that they have a crush on you.  If you and your friend don’t normally hug and they start hugging you, this may also be a sign they like you. People sometimes feel awkward when they realize they like someone. If your friend usually hugs you but suddenly stops hugging you, this might actually be a sign they have a crush on you, too. The more you like someone, the more often you’ll find excuses to touch them. If you notice that your friend constantly finds reasons to touch you, they probably like you.  Your friend might compliment the softness of your sweater, for instance, while touching your arm. If your friend suddenly becomes very physically affectionate, it could mean they like you. On the other hand, if the two of you touch each other often and your friend suddenly stops, they may be self-conscious because they like you. Some people are just naturally affectionate. If your friend frequently touches anyone they’re talking to, it may not mean anything when they do it to you.",
      "Spend some one-on-one time with your friend in a place without a lot of other distractions. Try to act relaxed and natural so your friend will feel comfortable opening up to you.  To bring up the conversation without seeming obvious, tell your friend how much they mean to you. Mention a few things you specifically like about them. This may make them feel encouraged enough to admit their feelings. If your friend tells you how much they value your friendship but doesn't say anything further, it may mean they want to remain your platonic friend. If you really want to know but they still haven’t told you, don’t be afraid to be upfront. Keep in mind that your friend will probably be caught off-guard, so let them know that they don’t have to answer right away.  Try saying something like, “Lately I’ve been getting the feeling that you want to be more than friends. I think it will be better for our friendship if we talk about it.” If your friend denies liking you, try to move on from the conversation quickly. Don't make a big show out of being relieved, in case they are trying to hide their true feelings. If your friend admits that they like you, but you don’t feel the same way, be gentle and kind but clearly let them know that you’re not interested in dating them. Say something like, “I am so glad you told me and that’s so flattering. I’m sorry, but I don’t have the same feelings towards you. If you’d like, I hope we can stay close friends. If not, I understand.” Your friend may feel hurt by being turned down, even if you are very kind about it. Give them some time to allow their heart and their pride to recover. After a week or 2, try reaching out to your friend to see if they’d like to join you and a few other friends to hang out. However, it’s probably not a good idea to spend one-on-one time together for a while, to avoid your friend getting mixed signals. In the best case scenario, your friend will admit they like you and you’ll discover that you share the same feelings! In this case, plan a few dates, have fun together, and tell all of your friends! It's natural to worry about harming the friendship if a romantic relationship doesn't work out, but keep in mind that it will be better to know for sure rather than wondering later if you missed a chance at love."

      "Avoid presuming that you know what will make him or her feel better. They may know of specific things you can do to be supportive and there's nothing wrong with asking. It shows your willingness to stand by his or her side while through the journey of grieving a lost sibling. For example, you can say \"I'm so sorry for your loss. Is there anything I can do to help you right now?\" Let him or her know that you are there if he or she needs someone to speak with. Talking about feelings can help process the death of a sibling. Be a sympathetic ear, to the extent that you can, if he or she needs to express the painful set of emotions.  He or she may want to talk about his or her relationship with the sibling while still alive. This can be a good way to memorialize the sibling. Avoid interjecting too much of your own feelings and experiences. You may have had a similar loss, but be mindful of being a burden with your own past. Your friend may need emotional space. You don't need to go into a lot of detail, especially if she hasn't offered the information freely, but by validating the event you can show her your willingness to engage with her in this difficult time. For example, you can say \"I heard about the loss of your sibling. I'm so sorry.\" Losing a sibling can be a powerful experience. A response of intense sadness and grief is often totally appropriate. Helping him or her understand that a strong emotional reaction is both \"normal\" and \"understandable\" is a good way of showing support.  For example, you can say \"It's okay for you to be sad right now. I understand. I would feel the same way.\" You can also tell him or her that it's understandable if they have specific painful feelings related to being siblings (like guilt). These emotions are understandable to experience, even if they are ultimately misguided. Unfortunately, sometimes the loss of a sibling can be overshadowed by the loss of a child. Parents can sometimes \"take the spotlight\" in the aftermath of these events. Surviving siblings are often referred to as \"forgotten grievers.\" If you think your friend or loved one may be getting overlooked, talk to other siblings, parents, or friends about providing support.  For example, you can say \"I'm worried about [name]. I think [he or she] is taking the loss really hard and needs support.\" Be mindful of other people's suffering. Avoid bringing this up to suffering family members if you're an outsider to the family. Talking to her other close friends may be a safer bet. Grief is normal, but sometimes this kind of loss can result in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, if the loss involved trauma. If he or she appears to be having a really difficult time coping with the loss, suggest that it could be helpful to speak with a professional mental health worker. For example, you can say \"You must have been really close to your sibling. Have you thought about talking to a professional who can help you understand what you're going through?\" In an effort to comfort someone without really knowing how, you may reach for the most familiar thing to say. However well-intentioned, offering up \"stock\" or \"stereotypical\" platitudes can simply make her feel worse. Rather than comforting, these statements can gloss over the pain of the moment and try to usher in a level of acceptance that isn't appropriate. For example, here are some phrases you probably want to avoid:  \"You'll feel better soon.\" \"Time heals all wounds.\" \"At least you still have your other family members.\" \"Everything happens for a reason.\"",
      "Unfortunately, the bustle of everyday life doesn't go away when you lose someone close to you. Help out by taking care of some of these daily needs. Ask him or her if you can help with groceries, flowers for the funeral, or anything else. Simple gestures like these will go a long way to comforting and supporting someone during this hard time. Bringing frozen meals over is a safe bet for someone who is grieving. This will show that you care and want to ease the pain of the grieving process by letting him or her focus energy on the family rather than figuring out what to make for dinner. If there are any responsibilities that have to do with the funeral, housing relatives, or providing transport for people, lend a hand with these tasks. These responsibilities can be a heavy burden when trying to deal with the weight of loss. You may not be able to do all of them for this person, such as talking to a funeral home director or providing a place to stay for visiting family, but any help you can manage will lighten the load. He or she may occasionally need a break from thinking about what's happened with a sibling. Take him or her to see a movie, pack a picnic, or do something else together that could be enjoyable. It doesn't need to be anything expensive or elaborate; the gesture and the company count the most. It's true that your friend or loved one may need concentrated support right after the death, but grief requires a lot of time and effort to process. If you want to provide comfort to the best of your abilities, understand that it may take months or even years to deal with the loss. Offer support at the beginning, but keep him or her in mind later as well. Many people's support will fall off after a while. If you truly want to help, be sensitive to the needs and the pain for as long as it takes.",
      "There are five different stages of grief that people go through following this kind of loss. Memorize these steps so that you can figure out where your friend is at in the process and try to help with each specific step. Remember that people are different and some do not go through the stages in order and can revisit past stages before reaching acceptance.  Denial is first. Denial of the reality of the loss is a normal reaction. It may seem like he or she doesn't realize the death of her sibling. It may not have set in yet. Anger comes next. Once the reality of the loss does set in, it's normal to experience anger over the loss. He or she may be angry at the sibling, at herself, or at someone else. Bargaining is third. This shows up as a desire to change the situation, such as wishing that he or she had done something differently. Depression is the fourth step. This is the stage where people mourn the loss and bid the person farewell. It's an essential step in the process of grieving. Acceptance is the final stage. After all of the stages of resistance to loss, acceptance is the stage where people finally come to terms. It's not happiness, but it is calm compared to the stages before it. The grief of losing a loved one is bad enough, but losing a sibling often creates specific painful responses. For example, someone may feel bad about how he or she treated her sibling in the past. A person may feel \"survivor's guilt\" over being left alive. When talking to your friend or loved one and doing things for him or her, be aware of these difficult issues associated with the loss of a sibling. If you notice that he or she is feeling these things, try to reassure him or her that it was not his or her fault. Grief does not always have a timeline and time does not necessarily heal all wounds. You can expect him or her to get better as time passes, but they may never make a full recovery. People respond differently to loss. Avoid pushing someone to move on. Allow the person to grieve and recover at his or her own pace. If you feel yourself getting impatient, it's better to back off and let someone else offer support than to pass those feelings on to her. It's perfectly okay for him or her to spend some time alone. He or she may want to dedicate time and energy to thinking about his or her sibling and processing all of the emotions that come up. If your friend or loved one says that he or she needs space, try to be understanding. Tell him or her that you're here if he or she does need someone to talk to or be around."

      "If your teacher allows you to pick your own seats, choose to sit next to a student you don’t know. Sitting next to a buddy of yours makes it extremely difficult to focus on staying quiet. It’s also helpful to pick a seat closer to the front of the classroom. Close proximity to the teacher will make it harder for you to chit chat as the teacher will likely remind you to quiet down. It’s also a good idea to look for a student who you know is very quiet, and sit next to them. Chances are they won't try to start a conversation in the middle of class like your best friend might. Pay attention to your peers, you'll probably notice at least one student who is reserved and rarely talks during class. Think of this student as your guide, and mimic their behavior in the classroom. If they are sitting attentively with their book open, you should be doing the same. Before you open your mouth, think to yourself “Is this something that can wait?” Or “Will my teacher be upset if I interrupt to say this?” Many students talk during class because they forget to filter their thoughts before letting them escape as words. Forgetting to filter your thoughts results in blurting out whatever it is you are thinking for the whole class to hear. Take the time to really think about what you want to say during class for relevance. If it is at all disruptive, like \"This subject is boring, is class almost over?\" do not say that out loud.  A good trick is to raise your hand every time you think of something to say. While waiting for the teacher to call on you, think about whether or not what you have to say pertains to what the teacher is discussing. If it’s not related to the lesson, put your hand down and remain quiet. Always raise your hand when you have a question about class. Not talking during class does not mean your questions about the lesson should go unanswered. If you find yourself with so many things to say that it’s almost impossible to stay quiet, write them down instead. Many students have a problem staying quiet when they think they have a funny joke or anecdote to share with the class, this is a great alternative to interrupting the class with your joke. It also helps if you're constantly thinking of things you'd like to ask your friend during class. Grab a piece of paper and jot down all the jokes you thought up and all the things you have to ask your friend, instead of speaking them. For instance, if you're sitting in class and remember that your mom said it was okay for your buddy to stay the night this weekend, instead of turning to ask them during class, take out your notebook and write \"Remember to tell Jimmy that my mom said it was okay for them to stay the night this weekend.\" Although it doesn't involve talking, texting what you have to say is never a good option. You should never have your phone out during class, it distracts you from the lesson and disrupts the class when the teacher has to stop and ask you to put it away. Leave your phone tucked away in a safe place like your pocket or locker. Sometimes it’s not that you can’t stay quiet, but that you can’t stop responding to talkative people. Politely tell the students around you before class that you can’t talk to them until class is finished. Then ignore their comments during the lesson. They will soon figure out that you no longer talk during class and will stop trying.  While out in the hallway before class, try taking your talkative classmates aside and say something like “I’m not going to talk during class anymore, so can we talk at lunch instead?” Ignoring comments made in class can be difficult, especially if someone says something that upsets you. If this happens, write it down so you can tell the person who said it later that it upset you instead of angrily responding and disrupting the class lecture.",
      "There is no shame in asking someone to help you stop talking. Try asking one of your friends to give you a cue whenever you start to talk in class. Maybe they can cough or tap your shoulder. Whatever cue you decide on, make sure it doesn’t involve them talking to you at all or it defeats the purpose. It may seem like your teacher is always yelling at you to stop talking, but they can be a great help if you ask them. Tell your teacher you’re having a hard time not talking in class, and see if they have any suggestions for things you can try. After class, tell your teacher something like \"I'm trying really hard to stop talking during your class, but I'm still struggling with it. Could you please help me?\" More than likely, your teacher will be delighted to give you some pointers on staying quiet. Put a sticky note on your desk and write something on it to remind yourself not to talk. Every time you get the urge to speak, glance down at your sticky note. Try writing something like “I can talk when class is over.” Or “Silence is golden.” . Just keep trying to stay quiet during class. It may take some time for you to learn these new techniques, but don’t give up! Set realistic goals for yourself, you might not be able to completely stop talking over night. To avoid frustration and getting discouraged, start by focusing on not talking at all through the first half of class. Once that becomes second nature, make your goal to not speak during the entire class. As you meet your goals, reward yourself with a piece of candy or 10 extra minutes of play time after school. Positive reinforcements like these will help you continue to keep up the good work."

      "Before you undergo a stem cell or bone marrow transplant, your doctor may recommend that you go through chemo, radiation, or both. Intense doses of chemotherapy and radiation will kill the cancerous cells, making it less likely they’ll multiply later.  If your doctor recommends intense chemotherapy, they may prefer you to have it on an inpatient basis, or in a specialized cancer center where you'll have more support. The side effects of intense chemotherapy might be more than you can treat on your own at home. If your doctor recommends you only undergo radiation before the transplant, they may recommend full-body irradiation. Instead of targeted irradiation, you would be placed under a machine like an MRI machine, and your entire body would be radiated. If the lymphoma has not yet spread to your blood or bone marrow cells, your doctor may be able to remove some of your healthy cells, then re-inject you with them after your chemo or radiation. Your doctor will need to perform blood and bone marrow tests to see if you qualify for this type of transplant. If the lymphoma has already spread, you can’t be re-injected with your own cells. Instead, you can undergo an allogeneic transplant, which uses the cells of a donor instead of your own. You’ll still need to undergo chemo or radiation first.",
      "Depending on your age, overall health, and the type and stage of your lymphoma, your doctor can tell you which chemo drugs are best for your treatment. Intravenous chemotherapy drugs are injected directly into your bloodstream. You may have several weeks of treatment, followed by several weeks to allow your body to rest. If you have severe side effects from the chemotherapy, you might be admitted to the hospital for a few days. Chemotherapy drugs administered through tablets tend to be less intense than intravenous drugs. Your doctor might prescribe this type of treatment if your body can’t handle the injection of chemo drugs, or if your lymphoma is at a low stage (stage 1 or 2). How and when you take them will depend on a lot of factors, so make sure you follow your doctor’s instructions exactly.  If your lymphoma is incurable, your doctor may prescribe chemo tablets to help treat your symptoms and make you more comfortable.",
      "If your lymphoma is only in 1 part of your body, your doctor might suggest external beam radiation. A machine directs radiation through the skin to the affected lymph nodes. Radioimmunotherapy combines external beam radiation with drugs that contain radioactive material. The drugs target the cancer cells, and their radioactive nature allows the external beam radiation to target cancerous cells more precisely (rather than lots of tissue around the tumors). It’s often used to shrink tumors near other organs. How and when exactly you need to take your immunotherapy drugs will depend on the exact nature of your cancer and overall health. Your doctor will tell you when you should take your drugs, the exact dosage, and when to have your radiation. If your lymphoma has progressed or spread significantly, your doctor might recommend you have a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. To prepare for this, your doctor might suggest you undergo full body irradiation to kill as many cancerous cells as possible.",
      "If you have Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, steroids taken with your chemotherapy might help treat it. Your doctor will be able to tell you, depending on previous treatments, your overall health, and the current stage of your cancer, whether it’s a good option for treatment. If your doctor decides steroids are a productive addition to your treatment plan, they might prescribe them for you intravenously. In that case, they would be administered to you at the same time as your outpatient chemotherapy. Depending on the dosage you need, your doctor might prescribe steroids in pill form instead. Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking them exactly – to work with the chemotherapy you’ll need to take them at specific times."

    ],
    "document": [
      "Separate a strand of your hair that doesn’t often show in whatever style you most commonly wear your hair in. Clip back the surrounding hair so that it doesn’t get in the way or get dyed accidentally.  Try a section near your ear for an easily accessible and often hidden strand. Separate a strand that’s at least an inch wide for a more accurate representation of what a larger quantity of hair will look like once dyed. Choose a strand that includes some gray hairs if you aim to cover grays with this dye.  You may perform this test by cutting a smaller strand of hair off to dye it, but note that this will only test for color results, not allergic reactions. Use an applicator brush, comb, or your gloved fingertips to apply the mixed hair dye from your bowl to your separated strand of hair.  Make sure to work the dye through the hair strand thoroughly from root to tip as you would when dyeing normally and according to your instructions. Try to apply to roots as close to the scalp as possible without getting dye directly on the skin of the scalp. If this is your first time dyeing your hair, apply dye to the middle of your hair strand and leave it in for 15 minutes before you apply to the roots and ends. Dye processes more quickly at the roots of hair due to heat from your scalp, as well as at the ends due to dryness, so this application may help to create more even color.  If you’ve dyed your hair previously, apply the current dye to your strand of hair at the roots down to where your previous dye color shows and leave it in for 15 minutes before adding color to the rest of the strand. This will help even out possible differences in color between previously dyed hair and undyed roots. Leave the dye in for 30 minutes or whatever duration your specific instructions recommend.  Take care to keep the dyed strand from touching any other hair, your skin, or clothes during this time. You can wrap your dyed strand in tinfoil or plastic wrap to protect it if you wish. Note that this can also accelerate the dyeing process and result in stronger color due to the heat insulated within. Rinse out the dye from your strand of hair with warm water until the water runs clear, then blow dry or let it air dry.  Don’t use shampoo on your hair right away, but you may use a small amount of conditioner after the rinse if you wish. Try to keep the strand isolated during rinsing and drying so you can more accurately compare and determine the results.",
      "Wait another 24 hours after your strand dries to determine the results of the test. This will allow any allergic reactions to fully develop, and let you observe the color of the dyed strand in different lights and get used to the color.  If you know you are not allergic to the ingredients in your particular dye, you can perform the full dye on the rest of your hair right after the strand test, though waiting a full day can still be beneficial to help you get a better idea of the color. During the 24-hour period, test the condition of your hair by feeling its texture compared to your non-dyed hair and stretching out an individual hair to see how it behaves. Damaged hair will feel dry or coarser than normal, and will not resume its normal shape or length after being pulled.  To do a more accurate allergy test, you should perform a separate patch test by applying a small amount of dye to your inner elbow and observing your skin after 48 hours. If you notice any redness, itching, swelling, or pain with either a strand or patch test, you should wash off the dye immediately and not use it again. Look at your dyed strand when it is fully dry. If the color is darker than you wanted, leave the dye on for a shorter period of time or select a lighter shade when you dye your full head of hair.  The color on your hair strand may turn out darker if your hair is dry and brittle from excessive heat exposure or previous dyes. You may want to treat dry hair for a few weeks or months before you do a full dye. Color can also turn out darker if your hair is currently a lighter shade or if you’ve had it previously bleached or permed. Observe your fully dried hair strand to see if the new color is lighter than you want or expected. If so, leave the dye in for longer or select a darker shade of dye when you treat your full head of hair.  Your hair may not take the color as well if it has been recently shampooed or if you have previously colored your hair using henna, which can leave a residue that prevents dye from working as well. You may want to leave your hair color in longer, and apply it when your hair has not been washed in a couple of days. Hair dye also may not bind to your hair as well if you’re taking certain medications such as thyroid treatments, certain hormone therapies, or chemotherapy. You should apply dye when you are not taking these medications if possible, and consult a doctor or pharmacist to be sure that hair dyes will not interfere with the performance of any medication. Look at your dyed strand of hair when it is dry to see if it is a different tone or color than you were expecting. You will likely want to purchase a different shade for the full hair dye if this is the case.  If the color is too red, yellow, or “brassy,” try a dye with “ash” in the name of the shade (like “ash blonde” or “ash brown”) to neutralize it. You can mix the ash shade with your current shade to achieve the desired color. You may want to do another strand test after mixing the two shades.  If the color is not covering gray hair, you may need to leave the dye on for a longer period of time (see your specific dye instructions) or apply a cover or heat to your hair while the dye sits. Replicate your exact process during the strand test when you use the full amount of dye on the rest of your hair.  If you weren’t happy with the strand’s color, do another strand test with a new shade, mix of shades, or a different time period/heat application to achieve the desired results. If you do another strand test, isolate a different strand of hair than the one you used for the first test.",
      "Pull on the plastic gloves provided in your dyeing kit to protect your hands from the chemicals in the dye. You should leave these gloves on throughout the strand test.  If you don’t have gloves included with your dyeing materials, purchase any disposable latex or latex alternative gloves from the store. It’s important that you avoid contact of the dye with your skin. Many products contain dyeing agents that are toxic and can stain the skin. If you do get dye on your skin, rinse with warm water as soon as possible. For more stubborn stains, use olive oil, baby oil, or a gentle soap or laundry detergent. Squeeze 1 teaspoon of hair color and 1.5 teaspoon of developing cream into a plastic bowl and mix together thoroughly with a plastic spoon or applicator brush if you have one.  It’s best to use a disposable bowl or cup and spoon, as the dye can stain the bowl and utensil permanently. Follow your specific dyeing instructions if they suggest different quantities of color and developer. You need only a very small amount for one strand of hair.

      "Teachers assign notes so that you will be familiar with the topic being discussed in class. If you do the assigned notes before class, you’ll already know many of the background details. Then you can focus your note-taking on key concepts. Read through your notes from the previous lecture before class as well. This will help you get back up to speed on where you last left off in the class. If your teacher provides outlines, PowerPoint slides, or even a basic summary of the upcoming lecture, use it to your advantage.  Think of it as the framing for a house, which you will then complete and furnish with your note-taking. It may be tempting to just print out that lecture outline or slideshow and figure you can skip note-taking during class -- or just jot down a few things on the printout here and there.  But it is much better to use these materials to structure your notes. This is the best way to process information, which is after all the goal of note-taking. Many students are more comfortable typing than writing, but there are still reasons to consider the tried-and-true method of putting pen to paper. Some studies indicate that students who hand-write notes are more able to comprehend and recall lecture material than those who type. It can be easier to fall into transcription mode on a laptop. This is when where you try to type everything said instead of actively discerning what is most important to write down.  Writing things down by hand can help you achieve greater focus.  On the other hand, using a laptop or other electronic device makes it easier to format, save, edit, share, and read notes (with no worries about messy handwriting). Note-taking aids available on laptops are nearly endless, such as: “notebook layout” formatting on Microsoft Word, etc.; software that connects a recording of the lecture to your notes; note organization programs that let you unite materials of various type and formats, such as emails and PDFs; and collaborative note-taking platforms that allow you to team up with others to take notes in real time.  These may be lifesavers or distractions for you. Only you can judge what works best. Some instructors and institutions ban the use of laptops in class, so don’t discount the need to know how to write notes by hand. Choose a spot in the class where you will have few distractions. Then you will be able to pay attention better and take better notes. Find a spot where you can see and hear the lecturer clearly. You should also be able to see the board clearly.  Show up to class a little early to ensure you get your pick of seats. If you find yourself distracted by noisy fellow students, an air conditioning vent, or an unfortunate glare on the projector screen, discreetly move to a new seat if you can do so without causing a significant disruption.  Otherwise, do your best this time and find a new spot for the next time. If you take notes by hand, bring extra pens or pencils and paper.  If you take notes on a laptop or other electronic device, make sure it is sufficiently charged and ready to go as soon as class begins. Some people prefer using loose note sheets so they can lay them out on the table or floor when studying, while others find bound notebooks more tidy. Make sure your notes are clearly labeled for future reference. Write the date of the lecture and the topic at the top of each page. If you have multiple pages of notes, include page numbers as well. This will help you keep your notes in order. The more orderly your notes are at creation, the easier they will be to understand, revise, and study. One option is the outline format, especially if the lecture is clearly structured and/or presented in such a manner. In this format, you’ll have section headings. Underneath each section heading, write down ideas in bullet form and supplementary ideas with indented sub-bullets. This is much better than just writing down everything as a new point. Be warned that lecturers are not always organized about following main points with subpoints. Keep in mind that you may have to reorganize your notes after the lecture.",
      "In order to take better notes, you need to be an “active listener.” This means that you don’t just record what is said. Instead, you should engage with the material and determine the essential elements of what is being said.  For instance, instead of spending time writing down every detail of Theodore Roosevelt's various foreign policy actions, strive to establish key concepts of his overall foreign policy and identify the examples as support.  This way, you have already begun the process of learning and understanding (or, in other words, studying). This necessity of active engagement is one reason why many experts advise against recording lectures.,  If you do insist on recording lectures, or have a legitimate need to do so. Ask the professor beforehand if it’s okay to record. The lecture is considered the professor’s intellectual property. In addition, some institutions have specific policies regarding recording. Don’t waste time easing your way into note-taking mode at the beginning of class.  Be ready to go from the very start.  Lectures often begin with an explicit preview of what will be covered, or at least implicit “leads” about what is to follow.  Listen carefully to the opening of the lecture for context clues that can help your organization and discernment of what will be most important. Don’t pay attention to students who arrive late or who are not yet ready to take notes. Every instructor organizes each lecture into some sort of outline, even if it's implicit and loosely followed. The information that is included on lecture slides will give you a solid idea of how to keep your notes organized. The lecturer will use vocal patterns, hand gestures and other indications to emphasize important parts of the lecture. Start observing these patterns and gestures in order to discern what is essential information..  Recognize main ideas by identifying signal words and phrases that indicate something important is to follow. Your instructor is not going to send up a rocket when she states an important new idea or gives an example. But she will use signals to convey what she is doing. Every good speaker does it, and you should expect to receive these signals. Examples include:  There are three reasons why... First... second... third... The significance of this is... The impact of this is... From this, we can see…   Learn to identify other clues as well.  When making a key point, the lecturer may speak more slowly or loudly; repeat a word or phrase; take a longer pause before resuming speaking (perhaps even to take a drink of water); gesture with his or her hands more demonstratively; stop walking around and / or look more intently into the audience; and so on. Shorthand writing is a way to use shortcuts so that you don’t have to write every single word. You can also write notes more quickly, an essential skill when listening to a classroom lecture. But when taking notes, don’t use true shorthand like a stenographer. This requires lengthy transcription. Instead, develop your own set of shortcuts, abbreviations, symbols, sketches, etc. Even if no one else knows what your shorthand means, you’ll know what you mean.  Use abbreviations and skip unimportant words to take notes efficiently. Only record the important words that you need to get the idea of the point made. Skip words like \"the\" and \"a\" that do not convey additional meaning to the lecture content. Create abbreviations to help you write things down quickly, such as drawing arrows for increase/decrease or to show causation, and especially for terms used over and over again (e.g., IR for international relations). Paraphrase everything except formulas and specific definitions or facts that will likely be required verbatim on the exam. Underline, circle, star, highlight, or otherwise identify key examples, definitions, or other important materials.  Devise your own marking code to indicate each type. Try drawing diagrams or pictures for concepts you can't quickly describe or immediately understand.  For instance, draw a pie chart to roughly indicate the relative strength of political parties in a particular election instead of writing these details out. Make sure your letters and words are adequately spaced and legible so that you can read them later.  Few things are more frustrating than being unable to read your own handwriting, especially when trying to study for a biology exam. Don’t try to cram as much as possible onto each sheet.  Give yourself lots of white space on your page. More spaced-out writing allows plenty of room for revision and annotation later. This style is also easier to read and digest the information when studying. It is easy to zone out as the clock ticks near the end of the class period. Other students may be starting to gather up their materials and whisper to their friends about the latest gossip.  However, the conclusion of the lecture is just as vital as the introduction in laying out the big picture and key themes and concepts. If there is a summary at the end of the lecture, pay close attention to it. You can use it to check the organization of your notes. If your notes seem disorganized, copy down the main points that are covered in the summary. It will help in revising your notes later. During lecture, as well as at the end of the lecture, make sure to ask questions about points that you don’t understand.  When other students ask questions, write down the questions and the instructor's answers.  This additional information might answer questions you have as well.  If you are self-conscious about holding up the class by asking a question (and annoying the students who already have one foot out the door), ask your professor after class. You’ll likely find other students doing the same, and can listen in on their questions as well. You can also bring a list of questions to your professor’s office hours.",
      "Do your review within 24 hours after the lecture. By this time, you may have already forgotten 80% of the lecture material.  Build upon what you have learned, instead of having to re-learn the material. Think of your in-class notes as your draft copy, and the revision as your edited copy. Create a new version of your notes. This will be helpful especially if your notes are sloppy, disorganized, or borderline illegible.  Don’t just copy down your notes as you originally wrote them. Make this part an active process of revision.  Use the clues you picked up during the lecture regarding structure and key concepts to reorganize what you wrote down. Fill in weak spots with material from the textbook. When you are revisiting your notes, you should also spend time to highlight or underline important parts of the lecture. Use different colored highlighters or pens to color-code recurring concepts. Marked-up notes will be valuable when you begin to study for the test. These allow you to quickly and efficiently recall key parts of each lecture. If you have missed a class due to illness or another reason, you should be sure to get notes from a classmate. Talk with the instructor as well so that you understand the material.  Don’t rely on a notes-for-sale service. Most universities have a policy against using these types of notes.  Remember, using purchased notes is not “active learning” that aids in understanding and retention. If you have a physical or other documented disability which makes note-taking difficult, discuss options with your professor and your institution’s student services.  Various options, including perhaps special lecture guides, note-taking assistance, permission to record lectures, or tutoring, will likely be available.",
      "The Cornell Method is a way to take notes that involves first taking notes and then developing questions from those notes. Divide your sheet into two sections by drawing a vertical line about 2.5 inches from the left margin. Continue this line until about two inches from the bottom of the sheet. Then draw a horizontal line two inches from the bottom edge. For laptop users, there are programs that can format your word processor in Cornell Method style. In the largest section of your now-divided page, take notes on the main ideas of the lecture as you go. Leave ample space for later revisions. Add examples, diagrams, charts, and other material that the instructor discusses. The left-side section of your page is used for generating your own questions from the lecture notes. These questions may help clarify points, definitions, and so on. Review your notes within one or two days. This will ensure that your recall of the information will be stronger.  You can develop potential test questions from this material. What do you think the instructor is going to ask on an exam? When you are studying your notes for an exam, cover the right-hand side of the page. See if you can answer the questions that you’ve included on the left-hand side. Use the bottom section of your page to provide a summary of this page’s notes. This will help you recall the important points for this portion of the lecture."

      "x = -b ± √(b2 - 4ac)      ---------------------                2a We obtain the expression:x = -4 ± √(42 - 4•1•1) / 2 You should get two x values. As shown above, we obtain two answers: x = -2 + √(3) or x = -2 - √(3) Plug the x values you obtained into two polynomial expressions as the constants. These will be your factors. If we call our two answers h and k, we're writing two factors like so:(x - h)(x - k) In this case, our final answer is:(x - (-2 + √(3))(x - (-2 - √(3)) = (x + 2 - √(3))(x + 2 + √(3))",
      "In this example, a is 6 and c is also 6.6 * 6 = 36 We're looking for two numbers that are factors of the a * c product we identified and also add up to the b term (13).4 * 9 = 36 4 + 9 = 13 Let's use k and h to represent the two numbers we got, 4 and 9:ax2 + kx + hx + c 6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6 Organize the equation so that you can factor out the greatest common factor of the first two terms and the last two terms. Both factored groups should be the same. Add the Greatest Common Factors together and enclose them in parentheses next to the factored group; the result will be your two factors:6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6 2x(3x + 2) + 3(3x + 2) (2x + 3)(3x + 2)",
      "As with the decomposition method, this is going to help us identify candidates for the b term. In this example, a is 8 and c is 2.8 * 2 = 16 This step is identical to the decomposition method - we're testing and rejecting candidates for the constants. The product of the a and c terms is 16, and the c term is 10:2 * 8 = 16 8 + 2 = 10 Take our two numbers from the previous step - let's call them h and k - and put them into this expression:((ax + h)(ax + k))/ a Here, we'd get:((8x + 8)(8x + 2)) / 8 In this example, we're seeing if (8x + 8) or (8x + 2) can be divided by 8. (8x + 8) is divisible by 8, so we'll divide this term by a and leave the other one as is.(8x + 8) = 8(x + 1) The term we're saving out of here is what's left after dividing by the a term:(x + 1) In this example, the second term, has a GCF of 2, since 8x + 2 = 2(4x + 1). Combine this answer with the term you identified in the previous step. These are your equation's factors.2(x + 1)(4x + 1)",
      "You will use the equation solver, also known as the [Y = ] screen. Once you've entered your equation, press [GRAPH] - you should see a smooth arc representing your equation (and it will be an arc since we are dealing with polynomials). Since polynomial equations are traditionally written as ax2 + bx + c = 0, these are the two x values that cause the expression to equal zero: (-1, 0), (2, 0) x = -1, x = 2 If you cannot identify where your graph crosses the x axis by sight, press [2nd] and then [TRACE]. Press [2] or select \"zero\". Slide the cursor to the left of an intersect and press [ENTER]. Slide the cursor to the right of an intersect and press [ENTER]. Slide the cursor as close as possible to the intersect and press [ENTER]. The calculator will find the x value. Do this for the other intersect also. If we term our two x-values h and k, the expression we will be using is:(x - h)(x - k) = 0 Thus, our two factors must be:(x - (-1))(x - 2) = (x + 1)(x - 2)",
      "In this case, we can see that 27 and 12 are both divisible by 3, so we'll separate that out:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4) To use this method you should be able to take the square root of the terms evenly. (Notice that we'll have left out the negative signs - since these numbers are squares they may be products of positive or two negative numbers)9x2 = 3x * 3x and 4 = 2 * 2 We'll take the a and c values from our step above - a = 9 and c = 4, then find their square roots - √a = 3 and √c = 2. These are the coefficients for the factor expressions:27x2 - 12 = 3(9x2 - 4) = 3(3x + 2)(3x - 2)",
      "The standard format for the quadratic equation is:ax2 + bx + c = 0 Start by ordering the terms in your equation from highest to lowest power, just like this standard format. For example, take: 6 + 6x2 + 13x = 0 We will re-order this expression so it's easier to work with by simply moving the terms around:6x2 + 13x + 6 = 0 Factoring the polynomial will result in two smaller expressions which can be multiplied to produce the original polynomial:6x2 + 13x + 6 = (2x + 3)(3x + 2) In this example, (2x +3) and (3x + 2) are factors of the original expression, 6x2 + 13x + 6. Multiply the factors you identified. Then combine like terms and you're done. Start with:(2x + 3)(3x + 2) Let's test it, multiplying the terms using FOIL (first - outer - inner - last), obtaining:6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6 From here, we can add 4x and 9x together since they're like terms. We know our factors are correct because we get the equation we started with:6x2 + 13x + 6",
      "Using the expression format ax2 + bx + c = 0, identify the a and c terms and list out what factors they have. For 3x2 + 2x - 8, that means:a = 3 and has one set of factors: 1 * 3 c = -8 and has four sets of factors: -2 * 4, -4 * 2, -8 * 1, and -1 * 8. You'll be filling in the constants for each expression into the space you've made:(  x    )(  x    ) For the a term in our example, 3x2, there is only one possibility for our example: (3x   )(1x   ) Let's say we chose 8 and 1. Write it in:(3x  8)(x  1) Depending on the signs in the original expression, it's possible to figure out what the signs for the constants should be. Let's call the two constants for our two factors h and k:If ax2 + bx + c then (x + h)(x + k) If ax2 - bx - c or ax2 + bx - c then (x - h)(x + k) If ax2 - bx + c then (x - h)(x - k) For our example, 3x2 + 2x - 8, the signs must be:(x - h)(x + k), giving us the two factors:(3x + 8) and (x - 1) A quick first test to run is to see if the middle term is at least the correct value. If it is not, you may have chosen the wrong c factors. Let's test our answer:(3x + 8)(x - 1) By multiplication, we arrive at:3x2 - 3x + 8x - 8 Simplifying this expression by adding the like terms (-3x) and (8x), we get:3x2 - 3x + 8x - 8 = 3x2 + 5x - 8 We know now that we must have identified the wrong factors:3x2 + 5x - 8 ≠ 3x2 + 2x - 8 In our example, let's try 2 and 4 instead of 1 and 8:(3x + 2)(x - 4) Now our c term is a -8, but our outside/inside product (3x * -4) and (2 * x) is -12x and 2x, which will not combine to make the correct b term of +2x.-12x + 2x = 10x 10x ≠ 2x Let's try moving the 2 and 4 around:(3x + 4)(x - 2) Now, our c term (4 * 2 = 8) is still okay, but the outside/inside products are -6x and 4x. If we combine them:-6x + 4x = 2x 2x ≠ -2x We're pretty close to the 2x we were aiming for, but it's the wrong sign. We're going to stick with the same order, but swap which one has the minus:(3x - 4)(x + 2) Now the c term is still okay, and the outside/inside products are now (6x) and (-4x). Since:6x - 4x = 2x 2x = 2x We can now recognize the positive 2x from the original problem. These must be the correct factors."

      "When you are getting a girl turned on using words it's important that she can hear your voice; don't try to get a girl hot and steamy over MSN, IM, or through texting. It can be done, but your words will have a much better effect if the girl you are talking to can hear the sexy tones in your voice. Try to use your deepest-sounding voice when you talk to your girl. Studies show that men with deep voices have more sexual partners and that females are more attracted to men with deep voices. Now, that doesn't mean you should lower your voice if it sounds unnatural, because that won't turn your girl on. But if you're always in the higher pitched level of your voice, try to go down to the lower level when you're talking with your girl. When you start talking to her, it's important to set the mood for the entire conversation by saying things like \"I can't stop thinking about you,\" or \"I've been wanting to hear your voice all day.\" This will help establish closeness, and let her know that you're feeling intimate. Make sure you’re alone and in a comfortable, sexy environment; you may not want to turn her on in public.  Other things to say are: \"I never knew it until I spent time away from you, but I missed you today,\" or \"You look stunning, as usual.\" Keep it short and sweet; a very elaborate compliment might come off wrong or be misinterpreted by her. Don't compare her to other women. Even if what you're saying is that she's smarter, or prettier, or more fun to be around, avoid the comparison. She doesn't even want you to compare her to other women, because she doesn't want you to think about other women. She wants you to think about only her. If she thinks you may be thinking about other women, it's a turn-off for her. Ask her something that will give her a chance to give a long answer, like \"So tell me about what you did today,\" or \"What exciting things do you have planned for the weekend?\" This will get her talking and will show her that you care.  Asking her a good question will show her that you're interested in what she has to say. Girls want to be sexy and interesting; for her, a good conversation is a way to set the tone. If she answers with a short answer, pepper her with more questions, showing her you care and really want to know. You want to get her on a roll, talking about things she's interested about, all while you're doing a good job listening. Be funny and playful, if you can. Girls love guys with a sense of humor, along with guys who know how to have fun. If you're making her laugh and keeping her on the tips of her toes, it'll be easier to turn her on. Look up and practice some jokes you think she might like, or start developing your own inside jokes with her that you can lean on when you know you need a laugh. If she asks you how your day was, let her know that you were thinking about her. Add a slight twist by complimenting her features. Don't make it too smutty though. Something like \"I couldn't stop thinking about you and your sexy smile\" does the job.  Keep the conversation going by asking questions about her and showing interest in her answers. The way that you start turning her on is by dropping plenty of little compliments. Make sure you think of little things to say just about her to make her feel special. Girls like it when you notice something about them that they also like. So if you know she likes the color of her eyes, compliment the color of her eyes (\"I love the way your eyes shine when you smile\"). If she likes her hair, say something like \"Your hair looks so smooth and comfortable, do you know how pretty it makes you look?\"  Start making the compliments slightly more sexy. If she is saying things like \"Stop!\" or \"You don't mean that\" while giggling, keep giving her the sexy compliments. You're definitely on the right path. Make sure that the things you are saying are sexy and romantic, not dirty and gross. You don’t want to come on too strong when you just start talking about what you want to do; you need to build up anticipation first.  You will need to come up with your own suggestions, but an example might be: \"If we were together, I'd run my fingers slowly through your hair while we kissed. I'd massage your back while I kissed your neck. I would lie next to you and trace my fingers over the soft curves of your beautiful body.\" etc. Be creative. Using lots of imagery and imaginative words can also help. Here are some other compliments that you can use: \"I thought about you when I woke up today. Just like I thought about you when I went to sleep last night. You know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about us, together, curled up in bed. That makes me happy.\" Something else you might say: \"You give me goosebumps. Every time you touch me I go crazy inside, because I know it's only you who can do that to me. No one else does that. Even a smile from you is like a punch in the gut, but in a good way.\" In your own way, make her feel like the sexiest woman alive. Get her thinking sexy thoughts about you and it's guaranteed that she won’t stop thinking about you when the conversation is over. This is the most important thing when it comes to turning your girl on; you don’t want her to feel like a piece of meat. While you try to turn her on with your words, make sure you let her see that you wouldn’t talk to just any girl this way. Let her see how lucky you feel to be with her.",
      "One of the most basic things you can say when you want to turn up the heat are these simple words: “I want you.” You can add other variations, but saying this makes the girl see how much you want to be physically close with her and may be enough to turn her on. Look her in the eyes and show that you’re not shy about saying what you want and need. Here are some other things you can say:  “I want you so bad right now.” “I’ve been wanting you all day long.” “I’ve never wanted you so badly in my life.” “That dress you’re wearing makes me want you more than ever.” As you move forward, you can compliment your girl’s body in a less-PG way. As long as you’re sure she’s playing along and that she would welcome compliments about parts of her body other than her face, you can start to take it up a notch by complimenting the parts of her body that turn you on. Just make sure you’re not offending her and that your comments are welcome. Here are some things you can say:  “Your chest looks amazing in that dress.” “Your legs are incredible.” “I love the way your hips are moving.” Now that you’ve described what you want to do to your girl’s body, you can go a step further and tell her what you’d like to do to her body. You can be a bit more graphic if you want, but in general, just say enough to have her imagine you having your hands all over her body, which should be more than enough to turn her on. Here are some things you can say:  “I want to run my hand down your thighs.” “I can’t wait to kiss the nape of your neck.” “I want to caress and kiss every part of your body.” \"I want to run my hands through your hair while I kiss you.\" Now, as you continue to turn your girl on with your words, you can tell her what you wish she would do to you. This would paint a sexy image in her mind and will have her turned on in no time at all. Of course, make sure she has done many of these things before so you don’t surprise her or come off sounding too graphic or explicit. Here are some things you can say to her:  “I want you to take my shirt off.” “I want you to kiss my chest and shoulders.” “I want you to get on top of me and start kissing my neck.” If you want to turn your girl on, then you should have no shame about telling her how turned on you are just by the sight of her. She’ll be turned on just by the idea that being around her is making you turned on. Here are some ways you can tell her how she makes you feel:  “I am so turned on just by being around you.” “You make me so excited.” “My whole body is tingling just from looking at you. You have no idea how good you make me feel.” Another way to turn your girl on is to tell her some fantasies you have about being with her. They can be related to role-playing, can be about explicit things you’d like to do to her or would like her to do to you, or can be about a place where you’ve always wanted to hook up. Don’t be afraid to tell her what you’ve always dreamed about and see if you can make it come true together. Let her reveal her fantasies, too. This can turn both of you on even more. Though turning your girl on with words is best done in person, you can leave her feeling sexy even after you’ve said your goodbyes by sending her a sexy text message later on in the day that shows her that you’re still thinking of her and her body. Keep it sweet and simple but also make sure there’s enough subtext to get her turned on and ready for your next encounter. Here are some things you can say:  “I can’t stop thinking about what happened last night. I can’t wait to see you again.” “When I close my eyes, all I see is your gorgeous body.” “I had such an amazing time with you last night. I can’t wait to have you in my arms again.”"

      "You can counteract the negative impact of being a scapegoat by cultivating healthy relationships. Plus, when you spend time around people who treat you fairly, you will stop accepting anything less.  Identify the relationships in your life in which you feel valued, encouraged, and supported. Make an effort to enrich these relationships by showing appreciation for these people and dedicating more of your time to them. Make new friendships through support groups, professional organizations, or interest groups in your community. Lean towards people who appear emotionally healthy and don’t blame you for their problems. Keep in mind that it is possible that you do not know what a healthy relationship looks like. This may be something that you will need to work on and a therapist can help you to develop the ability to recognize healthy relationships. Boundaries are the limitations where one person ends and another begins. In scapegoating relationships, these lines are all blurred. Stop allowing yourself to be scapegoated by setting firm boundaries. For instance, you might say to your business partner, “I will no longer tolerate being treated this way. If you want to continue having me as a partner, you will need to stop blaming me for the business failing.” When your boundaries are violated and others try to put you back in the scapegoat role, speak out. Show them that you are unwilling to be the scapegoat by reasserting your boundaries.  You might say to your scapegoating sibling, “No, I will not pay for your court fees. I told you that I will not be held responsible for your financial troubles.” Keep in mind that after changing your boundaries, people will likely test your boundaries. They may try hard to make you give in, but it is important to hold firm in your boundaries. If others refuses to respect your boundaries, you may have to make the tough choice to cut ties. Decide whether it is best to minimize contact or cut contact completely with the offenders.  Estrangement is a painful reality, but it may be necessary to help yourself get unstuck from the role of scapegoat. If the scapegoating happens in your family, you might cut ties. If it’s happening at your job, you might try to switch departments or transfer to a new employer. Work with your therapist to decide the best route for handling family members, partners or close friends who insist on blaming you.",
      "If you are often marked as a scapegoat, your self-talk may be belittling and unhelpful. You may catch yourself repeating internally the same claims others make about you. Boost your self-esteem by shifting your thoughts in a more positive direction.  Spot negative thoughts and learn to reframe them. For example, you may have come to believe, “I don’t deserve happiness.” Rephrase this positively by saying, “I deserve happiness and fulfilling relationships.” Pay attention to how you talk about yourself. You may even want to ask friends and family members to point out when you are speaking negatively about yourself. This will help you to notice the negative self-talk and correct it when it happens. If you are an easy mark for scapegoating, you may have developed the tendency of dwelling on the negatives. Start bringing your attention to the positive strengths you have to offer the world around you.  Make a list of good qualities, such as “helpful,” “compassionate,” “great listener,” and “intelligent.” Pull out your list when you find yourself playing into negative, self-defeating thought patterns. If you are having a hard time coming up with things to add to the list, then as friends and family members to help you. They may think of things that you would not have considered adding. You set the standard for how others should treat you by having a positive relationship with yourself. Perhaps others discount your positive qualities or treat you unfairly. But, this doesn’t not have to be how you see yourself. Begin to see yourself as worthy of fair treatment by treating yourself with compassion. Self-compassion means recognizing when you are feeling negative and being gentle on yourself. Remind yourself that you are only human. Give yourself a hug or soft caress. Say soothing phrases like “There, there” or “You are in pain now. But, you’ll be okay.” If you have been struggling with fear, self-doubt, or a sense of obligation to do other things, then you may have put some of your goals and dreams on hold. To start building your sense of self-worth, it is important to make your goals and dreams a priority. Start taking steps towards achieving a goal or dream that you have.  For example, if your goal is to run a 5k, then start a training program to help you get ready for it. If your goal is to earn a college degree, then fill out an application (or a few) for schools and programs that interest you. Anxiety and depression are common in scapegoats. It can be challenging to promote a positive self-esteem when you have been stuck in this role for most of your life. Reach out to a counselor or therapist who can help you overcome the victim role and recognize your untapped potential.  You might work with a therapist individually and/or with others to stop scapegoating behaviors. Search for support groups in your area or online for people in dysfunctional families or relationships. It’s likely that others in these groups will have taken on the scapegoat role. Sharing your feelings and concerns with the group may offer some release. You may also hear about effective strategies for developing your identity so that you are no longer such an easy target for scapegoating.",
      "Being the scapegoat to others can translate to being the victim of emotional bullying. Years of being picked on and manipulated by others has likely shifted your identity of who you are as a person. In order to stop being an easy target, you must admit to what’s happening and acknowledge the pain it causes.  For instance, being the scapegoat may have caused you to experience anxiety, depression, self-doubt, relationship turmoil, and even addiction. Think about the true impact being the scapegoat has on your life by identifying who has used you as a scapegoat and why these people are important in your life and for your sense of self-worth. Be honest with yourself about the negative consequences. It may help to journal about it. Cry, if you need to. Or, lean on a supportive friend. As hard as it may be to swallow, you have to accept that you are being scapegoated by others because you allow yourself to be. A major step towards overcoming scapegoating is to stop playing into the victim mentality. Just because others are trying to make you the victim, you don’t have to see yourself as one.  Consider what you may have been getting out of playing the role of a victim. For example, you might enjoy the attention, feelings of validation, sense of security, sympathy, and lowered expectations that come with playing the victim. Develop a new story of who you are that doesn’t involve being a victim. For instance, when something negative happens in your life, resist the temptation to connect it to people not failing to support you. This takes the control away from you and gives it to them. Instead look for some aspect of the problem in which you had control and brainstorm a solution from there.  You may also turn your attention to things you feel grateful for and people you can help. This may help you to feel more empowered. You are stuck in the scapegoat role because you are harboring negative feelings about others and yourself. Strive for forgiveness and you may be able to finally release the negative emotions that have been keeping you as the scapegoat.  Forgiveness doesn’t mean you aren’t holding others responsible for scapegoating, but letting go of the pain so you can move on. You can forgive yourself and others through rituals, such as by writing a letter. You can write a letter forgiving yourself and/or others for what you have done. Then read the letter out loud to yourself a few times and hang onto the letter to review whenever you need to remind yourself of the forgiveness. Light a candle and do several minutes of deep breathing. Bring to mind the pain you feel from the scapegoating. Picture the sensations and feelings you have attached to being the scapegoat (e.g. shame, anger, guilt, resentment, etc.). Write down all the thoughts and feelings you have. Imagine the negativity falling away from you. Take several more deep breaths. Blow out the candle as a symbol of letting go of the negativity for good."

      "If you are showing signs of potential hypothyroidism, your doctor can perform a simple blood test to confirm the diagnosis. Normally, your doctor will check for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 (one of the hormones released from the thyroid); sometimes T3 is also tested for.  TSH is a hormone that is made by your brain that travels to your thyroid gland (which is in the middle of the front of your neck) and tells it to make thyroid hormones. There are a number of different forms of thyroid hormone in the body termed T4, T3, etc. T4 is the main active hormone, so this is the one that is tested. A blood test is the definitive way to diagnose hypothyroidism, and it is the only sure way to know whether or not you have the condition. If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, the good news is that the treatment is generally quite simple. Most people are prescribed synthroid (Levothyroxine), which is a thyroid replacement hormone (synthetic T4) to get your levels back into the normal range. Speak to your doctor to obtain a prescription for this medication if you have been officially diagnosed with hypothyroidism on your blood tests.  Synthetic T4 hormone should be taken on an empty stomach, ideally an hour before breakfast. Note, however, that hypothyroidism treatments may not take immediate effect. Your doctor will need to pay close attention to your thyroid levels over the first few months to determine the correct dosage of medication. After being diagnosed and receiving initial medical treatment, you will need to go in for regular blood tests to ensure that your thyroid levels are normal. If they continue to fall outside the normal range (being either too high or too low), your doctor can adjust the dose of your medication to ensure that your thyroid levels do fall within the normal range.",
      "One of the most common signs of potential hypothyroidism is fatigue, and/or a recent drop in your energy levels. Because the thyroid is directly related to your metabolism, hypothyroidism correlates to a slower metabolism which can lead to a feeling of fatigue and sluggishness. Hypothyroidism may also cause you to gain weight, again because your metabolism is slowed down below its normal level. If you have been gaining weight lately for a seemingly unexplainable reason, it is possible that this is related to hypothyroidism. Another potential consequence of hypothyroidism is an intolerance of cold weather, meaning that you feel less able to handle being out in the cold. When your metabolism is slowed (as it is in hypothyroidism), you cannot generate the same internal heat to keep yourself warm. Hypothyroidism can lead to signs such as drier, thicker skin (from the glycosaminoglycan deposits in your tissues); a lack of sweating (due to decreased metabolism); fewer, coarser hairs on your body or eyebrows; and/or brittle nails. If you are noticing any of these things, especially in conjunction with other more common signs, and symptoms such as fatigue and weight gain, book an appointment with your doctor to have your thyroid tested. For some, hypothyroidism can manifest as a depressed mood. For others, it can lead to unusual snoring and/or fitful sleeps with awakenings during the night (as sometimes hypothyroidism can lead to concurrent sleep apnea). Hypothyroidism can also lead to constipation. If you are having bowel movements fewer than three times per week (over a period of at least three weeks), or significantly less than your normal, consult your physician. This may or may not be related to hypothyroidism; either way, it is something that is beneficial to speak up about as your doctor can help you to manage this problem. Sometimes hypothyroidism can cause you to be short of breath, particularly during exertion. If you are finding it harder than normal to catch your breath walking or working out at the gym, it may be a sign of thyroid abnormalities. (If it is not hypothyroidism, unexplained shortness of breath is still a concern that should be evaluated by your physician.) Hypothyroidism can manifest in a variety of different ways, and varies from person to person. Signs that occur less frequently (but may still be indicative of hypothyroidism) include:  Mild swelling around the eyes Menstrual irregularities in women Mild high blood pressure (this will require a doctor's evaluation) Elevated cholesterol (this will require a doctor's evaluation) Memory loss  Cognitive dysfunction (memory, concentration) Hoarse voice Leg swelling Slow heart rate"

      "A good way to discourage bad behavior is to reward good behavior—a principle known as ‘positive reinforcement.’ Animals generally tend to repeat behaviors for which they get rewarded, so the use of positive reinforcement teaches your pet to demonstrate good and desirable behavior.  There are several ways to make good behavior desirable to your pet, such as verbally praising him, giving him treats, and rewarding him with extra playtime.  Positive reinforcement is most effective when administered immediately after the good behavior. Immediate reward will help your pet make an association between behavior and reward. Positive reinforcement also works when used hand-in-hand with making bad behavior undesirable. Positive reinforcement avoids the use physical punishment. By emphasizing and rewarding good behavior, a pet who learns what to do through positive reinforcement is usually happier, more resilient, more confident, and better behaved than a pet who is physically punished. If your pet realizes that certain behaviors have undesirable consequences for him, then he will likely stop doing that behavior. Examples of undesirable consequences include inattention and deterrent devices.  Species-specific punishment, such as hissing at a cat, can make bad behavior less desirable without physically punishing or yelling at your pet.  Not showing affection towards your pet as he is performing the bad behavior is another way to make the behavior undesirable. Trying to correct your pet’s bad behavior without knowing why it is happening in the first place can be ineffective and may actually end up causing more harm than good. The root of the bad behavior may be improper human handling (e.g., bad training, lack of human handling, mistreatment) or medical (e.g., hormonal imbalance).  Conditions such as kidney disease or bladder incontinence can cause your dog or cat to demonstrate inappropriate urination. The bad behavior may also be rooted in inadequate socialization at an early age—your pet may not have learned the ‘checks and balances’ of his behavior. If you suspect that the bad behavior goes deeper than simple misbehaving, consider taking your pet to your veterinarian for a thorough medical workup.",
      "Just like cats, dogs will also do things that they shouldn’t. Upside-down mousetraps and deterrent devices are very effective at discouraging a dog’s bad behavior (e.g., getting into a trashcan). Withholding a treat when a good behavior is not performed is another undesirable consequence, and is especially useful when training your dog. Meeting bad behavior with inattention is another good way of making your dog’s bad behavior undesirable. Keep in mind that inattention will not always be a practical way to handle bad behavior, especially if that behavior results in physical injury. Your cat can certainly cause your love to wear thin if he is scratching up your furniture or attacking you. Rather than reprimanding him with harsh words or physical punishment, you can try other ways to make his bad behavior undesirable. For example, if your cat is scratching your sofa, you can make your sofa undesirable by placing orange peels by the sofa (cats don’t like the citrus smell) or putting double-sided tape on it.  If your cat is attacking you by playing too roughly, you can give him a time out. By not giving him attention, he will realize that his behavior is not rewarding, and will learn not to play roughly with you. If your cat likes to jump up on countertops or tables, you can place an upside-down mousetrap on the surface that will flip upward when he steps on it. This will be upsetting enough to get your cat to stop this bad behavior, but will not injure him. If your bird tends to bite, you can communicate through your body language that this behavior is unacceptable. For example, if your bird bites you when he is perched on your arm, you can rotate your arm to throw him slightly off balance. Creating unbalance without causing him to fall will be just enough to let him know that he should not bite you. If he is perched on your hand, you can unexpectedly and slightly drop your hand to throw him off balance. Discouraging your horse’s bad behavior can involve the use of direct (your hand) or indirect (your lead rope) pressure. For example, if your horse makes a habit of invading your personal space, you could use a lead rope or your hand to apply pressure to his body—the pressure will not hurt him, but will make him uncomfortable enough to step back. Due to a horse’s size, the risk of serious physical injury can be far greater with a horse’s bad behavior than a dog or cat’s bad behavior. If the bad behavior poses a physical danger, consider contacting your equine veterinarian or equine veterinary behaviorist for guidance on addressing dangerous bad behavior.",
      "This cannot be emphasized enough! Physical punishment has few benefits, if any, and many negative consequences. For example, your pet may become fearful and wary of you. Depending on your pet’s temperament, he may actually become more aggressive if you physically punish him.  The bad behavior may also become worse.  Examples of physical punishment including hitting, whipping, choking, and using devices that choke.  Physical punishment can injure your pet.  Physical punishment can also quickly escalate to animal abuse.  Although physical punishment is rarely warranted, it may be appropriate for horses who are especially dangerous and aggressive.  Physical punishment may also be warranted in situations in which the animal may other injure himself, you, or others. This is crucial to maintaining a good relationship with your pet when he misbehaves. Whichever type of pet you have, yelling at him is not an effective method of reprimanding him for bad behavior. Your pet will likely become fearful and wary of you, and may even hide from you if he can. Rather than yell him, you could let him know that he has misbehaved by saying ‘no’ in an authoritative voice. Reprimanding your pet after he has done something wrong is ineffective because he will not know why you are reprimanding him. This can cause your pet to become confused and maybe even fearful of you, both of which can hurt the relationship you have with him. It is recommended to issue your reprimand  immediately —within 1 to 2 seconds of the bad behavior. For example, if you come home one day and notice that your cat has scratched up your furniture or your dog has chewed up your shoes, it is too late to reprimand him at that point. If you do not reprimand your pet each time that he does the bad behavior, he will likely not understand that the behavior is bad. For example, if you do not give your cat a time out each time that he plays roughly, he will not associate his behavior with an undesirable consequence, and may keep on doing it.  It is very important that you reprimand bad behavior 100% of the time that it happens.  Another way to be consistent is to use the same cue or action each time you reprimand the behavior. Some pets may demonstrate behavior because they are afraid of a certain situation, and not because of willful misbehavior. Reprimanding fear-based behavior will not only make your pet’s fear worse, but may cause him to become increasingly aggressive.  If your pet has fear-based bad behavior, you should promptly remove him from the situation that makes him fearful. If possible, prevent repeated exposures to the fearful situation.  If preventing the fearful situation is not possible, you can gradually re-expose your pet to the situation to decrease his fear and lessen his fear-based behavior. Your veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist can provide helpful guidance on how to do this. Stereotypies are abnormal behaviors that can develop when an animal is an abnormal environment. Stereotypies are often repetitive and typically do not perform any function. An example of a stereotype is cribbing—when a horse bites down an inanimate and stationary object and sucks in air. It can be difficult to stop your pet from engaging in stereotypes. It is best to seek the expertise of your veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist to correct the stereotypical behavior. Your dog or cat will not learn anything from you rubbing his face in his urine and feces. This is  not  an effective method of reprimand. Your pet may end up fearing you and might even hide from you when he has to go to the bathroom. Your dog or cat may also end up thinking that  you’re  the one with bad behavior."

      "There are a few things you can do to make sure your cleaning area is ready for you to begin the process of cleaning your diamonds. Start by adding a stopper to your sink to ensure that your diamonds do not fall through and end up going down the sink drain. It would be a major hassle for you to have to take apart the pipes to retrieve your diamonds. Additionally, you’ll need a medium sized bowl to work with. You can put the bowl in the sink and fill it with hot water. This will be the base for your cleaning solution. Pour half a cup of the window cleaner into the warm water in the bowl in the sink. Mix the cleaner with the water and this will create your cleaning solution. Be sure to use enough cleaning solution that it will be powerful enough to clean your diamonds. You’ll need roughly at least a 1:5 ratio of cleaner to water in order to be effective. Dip the diamonds into the cleaning solution in the bowl and let the jewelry remain there for a minute or so. Then, take a clean toothbrush and dip it in the warm cleaning solution as well. Wet the bristles in the cleaner and use the toothbrush to gently scrub and clean the diamonds.  Remove the diamonds from the window cleaning solution, and scrub them carefully with the toothbrush. Repeat this process several times until the diamonds sparkle and shine. Be careful not to drop the diamonds or scrub too hard with the toothbrush. Make sure to get into the cracks and difficult to reach places where dirt and oil can get trapped to really clean the diamond jewelry. Use rubber gloves for this process to protect your skin from the cleaning solution and from the hot temperature of the water. Once you finish gently scrubbing the diamonds with the clean toothbrush, dip them back in the cleaning solution. Then, use hot water from the sink’s faucet and rinse the gems individually in the stream of water – always being careful not to drop them.  When you are done rinsing, pat the diamonds dry with a soft chamois towel. This will help remove any remaining residue or excess water. Then your diamonds should be as bright and beautiful as the first day when you bought them.",
      "Take your diamond jewelry off when you are performing arduous tasks. Diamond jewelry can suffer from wear and tear over time. The best thing you can do to counter this is to be mindful about when you wear your diamonds and when you don’t. Try to take your diamonds off before doing things like washing the dishes, going to the gym, working outdoors, or bathing. If you aren’t wearing the diamonds regularly and you want to store them for safe keeping, make sure that the diamonds aren’t touching each other. Diamond is one of the hardest materials on earth, so it’s quite easy for these gems to scratch other jewelry or other diamonds.  Wrap each diamond individually in tissue paper to keep it safely separated from any other item it may scratch. You can also keep each diamond in its own jewelry box container, or a jewelry box that has separated areas for different jewelry items. In order to keep your diamonds safe and secure while you are traveling, be sure to use a travel case intended for jewelry items. These items are typically made out of leather or another sturdy fabric and keep your jewelry safe while you are on the go.  Typically, these types of case are either hard-backed with zipper enclosures, or they roll up to keep the jewelry items stationary. Remember to wrap diamonds and individual diamond items in tissue paper to prevent scratching or other damage.",
      "Usually when you purchase an expensive piece of diamond jewelry, you can take it to the jeweler or jewelry store you bought it from for a regular cleaning. The jeweler should be able to clean your diamond jewelry with their professional equipment to get your diamonds looking like new again.  Most precious gems can be cleaned for free once every year by the store from which they were purchased. You should check with the store about this policy at the time of purchase so you know how often you can plan to get your diamond jewelry cleaned. You can also call after you’ve made your diamond purchase to inquire about this policy and how it applies to your specific jewelry. You may need to bring proof of purchase (like a receipt) with you to get the free cleaning. If you have antique diamond jewelry or aren’t able to clean your diamonds for free at the jeweler you bought them from, you should be able to bring your diamonds to any major jewelry store and pay for a cleaning for your diamond jewelry.  Depending on which jewelry shop you choose, getting a smaller piece of diamond jewelry should cost between $20 and $50. Perform weekly cleaning maintenance to minimize the need for professional cleaning. Since getting your diamond jewelry cleaned can be a bit of a hassle, and even expensive if you don’t have a free option offered from your jeweler, doing a bit of weekly maintenance can be quite beneficial for you and your diamond jewelry. Make a mixture of gentle cleaning solution by adding a few drops of dish soap to a glass of water. Soak the diamond jewelry in the glass with the cleaning solution for one minute and then use a clean toothbrush to remove any excess dirt or oil."

      "The needle will have a cap on it when you push it onto the end of the syringe, or should if it's a fresh, clean needle. Push the needle down on the syringe so the needle stays on and won't come off. Take the cap off the needle and have it ready to draw fluid into the syringe. You won't be able to get medication into the syringe if you have the cap still placed over the needle. The aluminum cap protects the opening of the bottle and keeps the liquid from leaking out, such as if the bottle is tipped on its side or upside down. Use your fingernails to remove the cap. Never use a knife or sharp object because you will compromise the rubber cap and invite contamination. Before you do so, draw the same amount of air into the syringe as you want to draw from the bottle. This makes it easier for you to draw in the contents. Then, you can poke the needle into the rubber cap. The rubber cap will act as a vacuum to keep air out of the bottle, and when the needle is pushed through, this vacuum will not be disrupted. After you have pushed the air in your syringe into the bottle, raise the bottle up so that it is almost vertical above the syringe, and slowly pull back on the plunger. Draw the fluid into the syringe up to the desired amount. It's important to raise the bottle above the syringe to allow gravity to draw the fluid in, and so that you're not drawing in air instead. Lowering the bottle moves the liquid to the bottom (via gravity) and introduces the \"air\" component of the bottle. Removing the needle then ensures that liquid won't drip out. Store the bottle in a place where it's cool and dry and won't get damaged, like in a cooler or toolbox meant for storing your cattle medicating equipment. Flick your finger against the barrel for any bubbles that don't automatically float up. Slowly and carefully push the plunger to eject the air bubbles. This especially important if you are going to administer IM or IV injections.",
      "Because intramuscular injections are more painful than a SQ injection, efforts must be made to reduce the pain that a cow will feel when the needle is put in. To lessen the pain then, most veterinarians firmly thump the heel of their hand against the cow’s neck two or three times prior to introducing the needle. It's highly recommended you follow this procedure. Thumping the cow’s neck with your hand desensitizes the nerves so when the needle goes in, the cow is less likely to feel the needle going in and become startled. Hold the syringe in your dominant hand (right, if right-handed). Identify the injection triangle and select an area near the center. Then, get ready to put the needle in at a perpendicular angle to the surface of the skin. Keeping the needle perpendicular to the skin surface and a using firm, thrusting movement, push the needle through the skin into the muscle. This must be done immediately after the neck has been thumped a few times. The cow may flinch at this point, so be ready for it to move around a little in the chute, or a bit more if it's not used to human contact. Check to see if you have hit a vein or artery. To do this, withdraw the plunger of the syringe a small amount and look for blood back-flow. If you find blood going into the syringe, you’ve hit a blood vessel. You will have to withdraw and try a different site about 1 in (2.5 cm) from this site. Once you have checked that you have not hit a blood vessel, you can administer the medication. Slowly depress the plunger until the cow has received the correct dose. If you are giving more than 10 mL IM, be sure to give no more than 10 mL per injection site. After you have removed the syringe, press the spot with your fingers for a few moments to keep the spot from bleeding.",
      "Needle size is measured in ‘gauges’. The gauge of a needle is inversely proportional to its diameter, so the lower the gauge, the bigger the needle. For instance, a calf's skin is thinner than that of an adult cow, so a finer and higher gauge needle can be used instead. Use the finest gauge possible to make sure that the cow feels as little pain as possible, but not so fine that risk of breaking the needle is significant.  To give an injection to a calf weighing less than 500 pounds, an 18-20 gauge (g) needle with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) length is ideal. For larger animals weighing over 500 pounds, you will need a 16-18 g needle with of 1 ½ inch length. Breed can also play a part on determining needle gauge. Black Angus cattle tend to have thinner hides than Herefords, for instance, so you won't need a 16 g needle to pierce the thinner hide of an Angus cow, versus the thicker one of a Hereford. You will need a shorter needle for subcutaneous injections, and a longer needle for intramuscular and intravenous injections.  You won't need a needle longer than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm), for SQ injections because you only need to penetrate the skin. For IM and IV injections, needles that are around 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) or more are best. It is acceptable to use the same needle for up to 15 injections as long as it remains sharp and straight. Always change to a new needle when drawing from a different bottle of medication because using the old needle may introduce contamination. Never attempt to straighten a bent or burred needle because it is much more likely to break on you or break off in the process of injection. Burred needles are also to never be straightened, but simply tossed into a bio-hazard bin.",
      "It is much easier and safer to give injections to cattle that are restrained. You can use a head gate or squeeze chute (also called a crush) to restrain the cow. No matter what method of restraint you use, make sure that the cow is restrained well enough that it will not be able to injure you or someone else. A squeeze chute or cattle crush is a narrow stall with adjustable sides wide enough for 1 adult cow. The panels prevent the animal from moving. It may also have a calming effect on the animal. There’s also a gate in the front and back of the chute to keep the cow still. This makes the neck easily accessible for injections. Always read and follow the directions on the label of the medication or vaccination for the dosage and route of administration. The drug manufacturer is obliged by law to print instructions on the injection bottle as well as warnings, information about the targeted microorganisms, and other important details. If there is an option to choose between an intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SQ) injection route, always go for the SQ as it is less invasive, which means it is less likely to damage valuable carcass meat. However, some drugs need to be given by IM injection to be properly absorbed. The required site for injection, particularly in beef cattle, is a site called the \"injection triangle.\" This triangular area is located on either side of the cow’s neck and contains few vital structures (like blood vessels and nerves). The injection triangle is broadest at the shoulder and tapers up towards the ear. The retail value of meat from this site is lower than the rump, so you are less likely to lose money if you are planning on selling the meat. The landmarks for finding the triangle are:  The upper boundary is located below the spinal column following the line of the neck crest. The lower or angular boundary runs along and above the jugular furrow, which is located in the middle of the neck. The posterior boundary (the one closest to the rear of the animal) follows the line above the point of the shoulder, which angles up towards the top-line or top of the shoulder. The difference between the 2 is that with a syringe, you manually control how much of the drug gets injected into the cow. The dosing gun dispenses pre-set volumes of medicine for administering them to more than 1 animal.  A syringe is made up of 3 parts: the body (that contains the drug), the plunger (that fits snugly inside the barrel), and the needle. Syringes are plastic and you use them no more than once or twice before they need to be thrown away. Plastic syringes come in 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 20, 35, and 60 cc (1 cc = 1 mL) sizes. Use the syringe size required for the dose you are giving. A dose in a syringe should only be used for 1 animal. A dosing gun or pistol syringe has a glass barrel (loaded with multiple doses) with a plunger that has a thick rubber washer at the end to form a vacuum, a needle, and a handle-trigger that is the same as that on a caulking gun. Some guns have the option of attaching a bottle. Dosing guns come in 5, 12.5, 20, 25, and 50 mL sizes. This is if you have more than one medication or vaccination to give. The next shot should be administered in a place that is at least 4 inches (10 cm) (about a palm’s width) away from the first shot site. If you keep putting medication into the same spot, the cow’s body will have a harder time absorbing it. The medications could also react and become ineffective, or they could cause an adverse reaction that may kill the animal.",
      "Giving an IV injection takes a lot of skill and practice. It is a specialized technique not often administered to cattle by the owner. If you cannot perform the IV injection properly or don't know exactly how it's done, contact your veterinarian and have them perform the procedure for you. You can do this by running your fingers down the side of the cow's neck (it will be below where the invisible injection triangle would be) above the dewlap. You will feel the jugular vein throbbing. Once you have located it, press down on the lower part of the vein to make it bulge out. This will help you better locate the vein when giving the shot. Air bubbles, if injected into the jugular vein, can cause a serious health risk, if not death. If air is present in the syringe where the medication has been injected, hold the syringe upright and tap it using your fingers, until the air bubbles go up. Disperse the bubbles further by slightly depressing the plunger until all the air bubbles have noticeably gone out. A little medication will come out of the needle as you do so. Slowly, but firmly, insert the syringe into the bulging jugular vein. You will know if you have correctly hit the jugular vein because just a slight pulling of the plunger will draw blood into the syringe and mix with its contents. This is a good sign, unlike for SQ and IM injections. Very slowly press down on the plunger so that the fluid gradually goes into the cow’s vein. Once you have given the required amount of medicine, gently remove the needle. Hold your hand over the spot and press against it for a few moments to reduce the bleeding that will occur when you give this type of shot.",
      "If you are right-handed, hold the syringe in your right hand (and vice versa if you are left-handed). Identify the injection triangle and choose a spot in the center of this imaginary triangle. Using your left hand, pinch some of the animal's skin between your 2 forefingers and thumb. Lift this piece of skin straight out and away from the neck to form a \"tent.\" The tip of the needle can be placed under your thumb. Where you place the tip of the needle depends on what you are most comfortable with and where you are least likely to poke yourself. Take care not to touch the plunger (if using a syringe) or trigger (if using a dosing device). Using the forefinger of the hand holding the syringe, guide the needle into the center of 1 side the tent. This ensures you only insert the needle halfway instead of all the way into the skin fold, and reduces the chance of hitting muscle or a blood vessel. Once the needle is in at the required depth, release the skin and depress the plunger or squeeze the handle of the syringe with your syringe hand. Apply slow, steady pressure to the plunger. Once the injection is complete, withdraw the needle, cap it, and place the syringe on a dry, clean surface for future use, such as if you are planning on giving injections to more than 1 animal. Press and rub the injection site with your hand for a few seconds so that the spot does not bleed too much and to insure the injected fluid does not leak out too much. An SQ injection should not bleed nearly as much as an IM or IV injection, if at all, but there is greater risk of injected fluid leaking out. This leakage might be profuse if the skin is really tight or too much fluid is injected into 1 site."

      "Everyone enjoys a funny story. But it's hard to elicit laughs from a meandering or vague anecdote. Instead, you should strive to have several crisp, well-worded stories ready to tell at parties and other social events.  Think of the most amusing or odd stories from your life. These should be your go-to stories in conversations. Consider the likely audience for your anecdotes. If your goal is to see witty in conversations at an accounting convention, stories related to accounting might be appropriate. However, if you’re looking for witty stories you can tell anywhere, using common experiences such as school or parents or pets or children are best, since more people will be able to relate to them. The same basic story can either be confusing, boring, or gut-busting. In order to make sure your story brings the laughs, you’ll need to polish it.  To get an idea of what makes a story funny, study the humorous phrasing and selective exaggeration employed by autobiographical humorists like David Sedaris.  Begin outlining your story. Try to remember details. Revise your anecdote crisp, clear, and humorous. Then work on memorizing and fine-tuning your verbal delivery so that it comes across as funny in person as it does on the page. If other people join the conversation, feel free to make fun of them.   Make fun of celebrities, singers or politicians. Just make sure that the other person is not a great fan of the celebrity your choosing to pick on. Don't go over the top. Don't make fun of someone's appearance, family situations, sexuality or disabilities (if any) unless you know it is something they are quite open about. Even then, even though they make self-deprecating jokes, they might not want to hear it from other people. Few things come across as wittier in a conversation than clever wordplay. Even if wordplay doesn't come naturally to you, you can improve with practice.  Know your vocabulary. Most wordplay depends on having a wide vocabulary. Consider vocabulary-building books, smartphone apps, and games, like crossword puzzles, to improve your command of words.  Know the types of wordplay. Spoonerisms (“It's roaring with pain” instead of “It's pouring with rain”), malapropisms (“dance a flamingo” instead of “dance a flamenco”), puns (“She had a photographic memory but never developed it”), and portmanteaus (“Chrismukkah,” a combination of “Christmas” and “Hanukkah”) can all be wittily inserted into conversation if used well.  Study examples of good wordplay. Everyone from Shakespeare to George Carlin to Kanye West employs wordplay in their writing and performances. Keeping your audience in mind, consume examples of good wordplay to help you understand how to employ it yourself.",
      "Before you can be witty, you need to improve your \"conversational intelligence.\" No matter how witty you are, launching into a conversation with a humorous story or a joke can come across as overbearing. Practice the \"Observe-Ask-Reveal\" method of being a conversationalist.  Begin by making it clear that you're interested in conversation. In social situations, its important to look approachable by giving nonverbal cues, such as adopting open body language and smiling.  Get a conversation going by engaging in strategic small talk. Every conversation needs to start somewhere. Begin with innocuous questions or comments about things around you to get a conversation going. Are you outside? What's the weather like? Are you at a party? What kind of food is being served? If you're speaking to a stranger, pivot from small talk to personal introductions and let the conversation develop from there. In order to know what the person you’re talking to will find amusing, you need to know more about them.  Most people are happy to talk about themselves, provided you give them the opportunity. Avoid \"yes\" or \"no\" questions. Instead, keep them open-ended. For example, when someone tells you their occupation, ask their favorite part of their job. When in doubt, ask \"Why?\" Let your conversation partner know you're genuinely interested in what they have to say by maintaining eye contact and subtle interjections like \"Really?\" \"Yeah?\" and \"Uh huh.\" Avoid interrupting your conversation partner, even if you think of something to say. Too often, if you’re trying too hard to be witty, you’ll neglect to listen, because you’re trying to think of your next comment. In order to be witty, though, you need to pay close attention to what your conversation partner is saying. Listen attentively to your conversation partner's words.  Don't interrupt. Even if something your conversation partner says sparks an idea for a comment, don't speak until there's a natural break in the conversation. Even the best comments, if made in the form of an interruption, can come across as rude. Note the rhythm of the conversation. Witty banter depends on timing. Listen closely to understand your conversation partner’s speech patterns so that you’ll know when to jump in with a comment. If you miss the moment, an otherwise witty rejoinder will fall flat. Once you know more about your conversation partner, you can begin to decide what you have in common and what might be the best mutual topic of conversation.  Think of amusing experiences you’ve had that relate to your conversation partner's interests. At the appropriate time, bring your experiences into the conversation.  Sometimes, all it takes is one experience. For example, if the person you’re talking to enjoys fishing but you’ve only been fishing once, think about what novice mistakes you made that your conversation partner might find amusing. Know your audience. British author Somerset Maugham once said “quotation…is a serviceable substitute for wit.” Indeed, cultural references — from books, songs, films, television, politics, etc. — can provide a shortcut to wit. However, in order to ensure your references don’t fall flat, you need to know your audience. For example, if you’re talking to a Baby Boomer, inserting a Beatles lyric into the conversation likely will be more effective than referencing a Taylor Swift song.",
      "People often want to be witty because they think they aren’t good conversationalists. But insecurity is the enemy of wit.  Good delivery often is the difference between a comment eliciting a laugh and falling flat. If you seem nervous or timid, your witty comment will not come across as well.  It’s important to remember that your perception of yourself is often inaccurate. You’re probably not as awkward as you imagine, and by letting yourself feel insecure, you’re actually hampering your ability to be witty. Paradoxically, the only way to overcome insecurity in conversation is to have more conversations! The key is engaging in low-stakes interactions (banter with a barista while you're waiting for your latte) as often as possible so that in high-stakes conversations (talking with the coworker you'd like to ask out) you're able to be witty. If face-to-face interactions make you nervous, try practicing your stories, puns, and other newly developed wit skills on social networking websites. Giving yourself a chance to work on your wit when you have more time to think might help you build your confidence so that you can be more relaxed during in-person interactions. As you become more confident, you’ll not only be able to move on when an attempt at wit falls flat, you’ll also know when to stop trying to be witty.  Shakespeare said “Brevity is the soul of wit.” Once you believe you’re witty, you won’t feel the need to try to make every comment witty — an effort that is bound to annoy or bore your conversation partner. Likewise, as you gain more confidence in your wit, you’ll learn when to quit. It’s always best to end a conversation on a high note."

      "This is the end of your line and the part that will be doing the knot tying.  Designate the end of your rope before you start. This is the rest of your line that would run up toward a reel if you were fishing, or a cinch if you were rock climbing. Basically it is all the middle section of your rope. The turn is when the end of the rope – the tag end – passes completely around the standing line. Some call this a wrap.",
      "You can tighten the loop by pulling the tagline with your right hand and end 1 with your left hand. End 1 will be next to the bigger loop at this point.  This will create a knot on top of your larger loop. End 1 should be able to slide back and forth enabling you to adjust the loop to the appropriate size. If you have ever tied a tie before, it's a similar concept to the tightening of a tie. To continue tightening your knot, pull end 1 through the large loop from behind. Imagine a tie that has already been tied. If you were following instructions to make a tighter fisherman's knot, you would take the bottom of the tie and stick it in through the top of the knot that is holding your tie in place. Once you've done this, pull the line upwards once again. This will proceed to make another small loop on top of the larger loop you just pulled your rope through. Make sure you pull it through the loop from behind. Pull the loop to tighten it using your left hand. Just like you tightened the first knot, tighten this knot by pulling the larger loop from either side. If you plan to undo your work and try again, then you probably shouldn't pull too hard or it will be hard to untie the knot.",
      "The end in your left hand is end 2, and the end in your right hand is end 1. End 1 will be doing the knot tying, so recognize this as the tag line.  Make sure you give yourself plenty of slack. It's helpful to have a lot of string or rope to work with as you learn. You want to cross them so that end 2 lies over end 1. The end of the tagline (end 2) will be behind the loop you have created and pointing downwards. You can leave a short tail or a long tail depending on how much rope you have. To start, make sure that you have at least 6 inches (15 cm) of rope to do the tying. This means that you should have 6 inches (15 cm) of rope above where you crossed it. You've crossed your two lines, so one line should be dangling over the other. Take the dangling piece and start to wrap it around the other piece. As you do this, the part of rope that you originally crossed will start to form a loop. So instead of wrapping that dangling piece (end 2) around end 1, pull end 2 through the loop and up to the left. This will create a smaller loop on top of the larger loop underneath. Keep the loops loose so you're able to get the line through the hole. Using your right hand, pull end 2 through the smaller loop. You should enter the smaller loop from the back and pull up to the front."

      "If your dog appears to be itching itself more than normal but you're unsure whether it has sarcoptic mange, this simple test can help. To start, take one of your dog's ears gently in your hand. Hold the loose, floppy part of the ear between your thumb and index finger. If you're worried about the possibility of getting bitten by your dog's mange-causing mites, you may want to wear disposable gloves for this test. Use your thumb and index finger to rub the dog's ear from both sides. Use slow, steady movements and don't squeeze too tightly. While you do this, keep your eyes on the dog's hind leg on the same side as the ear you're rubbing. You're looking for a movement in the dog's hind leg like it's trying to reach up to scratch its ear. If you see this, your dog may have sarcoptic mange. In this case, you should wash your hands and take the dog to a veterinarian at your earliest convenience. This test (called the pinnal-pedal reflex test) works because, in the vast majority of sarcoptic mange cases, mites are present in and around the dog's ears. When you rub the dog's ear, it feels the irritating itching sensation caused by the mites and tries to scratch itself. While the test does confirm your dog is itchy and sensitized, it does not confirm the cause. Sarcoptic mange can be very difficult to definitively diagnose. The pinnal-pedal test may lead to a presumptive diagnosis of scabies, in which case treatment should begin as soon as possible. If your dog responds to the therapy promptly, that is considered confirmation of the diagnosis.",
      "Sarcoptic mange usually causes frantic itching. The dog may relentlessly scratch or chew at its skin to relieve the itch. The dog's skin, irritated from the constant scratching and biting, can easily become infected. The itching can even be so severe that it distracts the dog from necessary behavior like eating, drinking, and resting. Severe cases of sarcoptic mange that result in secondary infections from bacteria or yeast can cause a white, crusty surface to form on the dog's irritated skin, though this does not occur in all cases. In addition, dogs with severe secondary infections will also often suffer weight loss, run a fever, and/or have enlarged lymph nodes. Localized demodectic mange, the least serious variety, usually results in one or two \"thin\" or bald patches in the dog's hair. Usually, this small patch will not appear inflamed or irritated and will not cause serious itching. If a case of localized demodectic mange does not go away on its own, it may eventually spread to the rest of the dog's body, resulting in generalized mange. The dog will develop numerous thin or bald patches over its body. Existing patches may grow to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. The skin in the patches may become red, scaly, and/or crusty. This skin irritation can cause the dog to scratch at its skin, which can sometimes lead to more serious infections. These secondary infections will lead to similar symptoms as those in sarcoptic mange cases — fever, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, etc. Some select cases of demodectic mange cause a condition called demodectic pododermatitis. This occurs when the mites that cause mange become deeply embedded in the dog's feet, where they are very difficult to remove. This condition most often presents itself in the form of swollen, irritated feet. It is usually worst around the nailbeds and often accompanied by a secondary infection. One of the ways to detect a case of mange on your dog is to find mite bites on yourself. When the type of mites that cause sarcoptic mange come into contact with a human, they can cause red bumps similar to mosquito bites. Luckily, these almost never become serious. However, seeing these symptoms after being around a dog that can't stop scratching itself is a strong indication of sarcoptic mange. Note that humans cannot get the type of mites that cause demodectic mange. Itching or patchy hair loss are also symptoms of other underlying health issues, such as allergies, hyperadrenocorticism  (Cushing's disease), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and parasite infection. Therefore, it is important to consult your veterinarian about the problem in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment.",
      "Dogs can contract two forms of mange — sarcoptic mange and demodectic mange. Though both can be serious, the two forms of the disease differ somewhat in the symptoms they present (see Part 1) and have different causes. Sarcoptic mange is an infection by a specific kind of mite that is passed along from other infected animals. Demodectic mange is caused by a different kind of mite that is normally present in a dog's skin. While most dogs live in harmony with these mites, sometimes the mites can proliferate and cause hair loss and irritation.   Although both sarcoptic and generalized demodectic mange can lead to itching, it's important to distinguish the two — the mites that cause sarcoptic mange lead to immediate, severe itching, while the mites that cause demodectic mange cause patches of irritated skin to develop, which then may become itchy.  While sarcoptic mange itself can't kill a dog, the dog's health can deteriorate quickly if it gets a serious infection or stops eating or sleeping, so, in this case, immediate veterinary care may be needed. This should be obvious — a dog with a bad case of sarcoptic mange will appear profoundly unhealthy. Sarcoptic mange is sometimes referred to as scabies.  Demodectic mange may also be called Demodex. Localized demodectic mange is characterized by hair loss in one or two spots. If unresolved (possibly because of suppressed immunity, allergies, or endocrine issues), the condition may spread, resulting in a proliferation of bald patches that may become irritated and infected, which lead to itching and scabbing.  Localized demodectic mange is most common in puppies. In about 90% of cases, localized demodectic mange disappears on its own without treatment in a month or two. However, in a fraction of cases, the disease may develop into the more serious generalized demodectic mange. While dogs do not inherit demodectic mange per se, is thought that those that develop generalized demodectic mange usually inherit their weakness to the disease genetically. Pododermatitis is a third type of demodectic mange; in some cases the dog may have the classic symptoms of demodectic mange, while others may have foot infections only. Treatment of pododermatitis can be long and complicated, often involving administering antibiotics and frequently dipping the dog's feet in a medication called Mitaban. Because treatment is difficult, spotting this condition early is critical.",
      "If you think your dog has any sort of mange, you should consult your veterinarian. Only a trained, experienced vet can run the proper diagnostic tests to determine the type and severity of the mange. Depending on the diagnosis, the vet will then prescribe the proper medication to treat the mange. Because mange is almost always easiest to treat before it becomes severe, seeing your vet as quickly as possible is important to ensure your pet is back to normal as soon as possible.  Cases of sarcoptic mange require a veterinarian more urgently than demodectic mange. Because the severe itching from sarcoptic mange can make a dog miserable (and, more importantly, quickly lead to health problems), early diagnosis and treatment is essential. The exception to this general rule is for very minor cases of localized demodectic mange. Because these usually clear up on their own, a veterinarian is not always necessary, though you may want to consult with one for peace of mind anyway, and to rule out other conditions. In cases of mange (especially sarcoptic mange, which is contagious), any objects that have recently come into contact with the dog's hair or skin should immediately be washed or replaced. This includes its bedding, collar, leash, harness, doghouse, and any brushes or cleaning products. The need for cleaning is especially urgent if you have other pets who don't have mange yet. For fabric objects, launder with bleach or borax and dry at the highest possible setting. For hard objects and surfaces, use a hospital-grade disinfectant. Repeat daily as needed until the mange subsides. As noted above, dogs who get bad cases of demodectic mange sometimes have a weakness in their immune system that they've inherited from their parents. Because of this, owners of dogs that have had long, severe, or difficult-to-treat cases of demodectic mange are usually encouraged not to breed their dogs. For dogs that have had minor, localized cases of demodectic mange, breeding is sometimes considered acceptable, especially if the mange occurred when the dog was young and cleared up on its own.  It's worth noting, however, that some veterinarians will recommend against breeding dogs that have had any sort of demodectic mange. If you're unsure of whether it's wise to breed your dog, talk to a vet who knows you and your dog for advice. Usually, a vet like this will be able to recommend a course of action that takes your needs into account as well as the health of any future puppies. Because sarcoptic mange is highly contagious, quarantine is essential for making sure that other pets and animals don't catch the aggravating disease. If your dog has sarcoptic mange, immediately separate it from other animals. Don't let it sleep, feed, or play near them. If you think a neighbor's dog has sarcoptic mange, don't let your own pets go near it. Once the mange has completely disappeared, the dog may be allowed to mingle with other animals as normal. Note that no form of demodectic mange is thought to be contagious to other animals or humans. In very rare cases, the disease may be contagious to other dogs. However, quarantine measures usually aren't taken even when symptoms are severe. Sarcoptic mange is highly contagious and usually passed from one infected dog to another. Often the infected dog shows few, if any, signs of the disease. Sarcoptic mange may be passed from a mother to her puppies, and is common in overcrowded conditions where dogs are poorly maintained, such as puppy mills, boarding kennels, and shelters. However, a dog might be exposed to mites even if it doesn't come into contact with a mangy animal: mites can survive four to 21 days away from their host in temperatures between 50-59 F (10-15 C), and two to six days in temperatures of 68-77 F (20-25 C).  A dog could catch mange from an object that has recently been used on an infected animal, such as a blanket or towel. Likewise, if grooming salons do not practice regular sanitation of clippers, towels, and caging, this could also lead to the spread of the disease.  Since wild animals like coyotes and foxes can also get sarcoptic mange, exercising in wildlife areas may also expose your dog to scabies."

If you fall into one of the following categories, you may want to talk to your doctor about taking special precautions when traveling. Risk factors include:  Being older than 40 Being overweight Not taking anticoagulant medication as prescribed A genetic blood clotting condition Having cancer or receiving cancer treatment Being pregnant or a recent delivery or c-section Taking hormone therapy or birth control pills Smoking A recent major surgery A broken bone in a lower body extremity (ankle, foot, leg, etc.) Consider an injection of anticoagulant medication if you have cancer, had a recent surgery or have thrombophilia. Depending on your medical history and condition, one of the steps that could help is to take an anticoagulant medication such as heparin. An injection of heparin can thin your blood and make it less likely to clot during the long flight. Ask your doctor whether this is a good option for you. Doctor-recommended compression stockings are a good lifestyle change if you are at risk of blood clots or have an upcoming flight. You should ask your doctor or pharmacist about the appropriate type of stocking, which may be a graduated compression stocking. They should go all the way up to your knee and can help improve circulation when used alongside regular exercise. An aisle seat will allow you to move your legs a little bit more during the flight, which will help improve circulation and reduce the risk of blood clots. Book your flight early so you can be sure to get an aisle seat. You may also be able to pay a little more for a row with extra leg room. If you can afford it, this may be another option to give yourself more space to stretch out. People who travel on flights longer than four hours are at an increased risk of blood clots. If you can take a vacation or attend an event a little bit closer to home, you will reduce your risk. See if you can meet friends, family or colleagues somewhere a little closer, perhaps less than a four-hour flight away. If a long trip is absolutely necessary, consider breaking it up with stops in between and give yourself time to rest, relax and walk about for a day or two between the legs of your trip. If it is not possible, you should at least give yourself a few hours of rest between flights. In this time, you should walk around and stretch.",
      "If you have been seated at a window seat and are at risk of blood clots, you should tell the flight attendants. Ask one of the flight attendants if they would be able to move you to an aisle seat. If you have carry on baggage, you should place it in the overhead container. Avoid putting anything at your feet, since it will reduce the amount of room that you have for stretching your legs. You should avoid alcohol both prior to your flight and during the actual flight, since it could put you to sleep and cause you to be immobile for a long period of time. A blood clot could form while you are sleeping in an uncomfortable position. If you take a sleeping pill, you could fall asleep and get a blood clot. As such, avoid the temptation of taking a sleeping pill. Instead, you could try taking very short, ten-minute naps. Bring a water bottle with you. When you finish it, ask the flight attendant to refill it for you. If you rely on the small cups of water they give you during the flight, you will not get adequate hydration. To improve circulation, it can help to take off your shoes. It will be easier to stretch your feet and toes without shoes. If you have a habit of crossing your legs, you should avoid it during a long flight. Crossing your legs will reduce circulation to parts of your legs, which will increase the risk of a blood clot.",
      "Flex your toes back towards your chest. Then, point them towards the ground. Repeat this exercise six to eight times for one set of foot stretches. Every once in awhile, say every half hour, you should perform this foot stretch. Every so often, you should do a simple toe stretch by pressing your toes to the ground and then raising them up to the ceiling. Complete five to eight repetitions. You can do the toe stretch after doing your foot stretch. Grab your knee and pull your leg up to your chest. Hold it for 15 seconds. Then, let it back down to the floor. Repeat the movement on your other side for one complete repetition. Complete 10 repetitions during your flight. Every once in awhile, you should press the balls of your feet to the ground. Press down to the floor to increase the circulation to your lower legs and feet. Roll your right ankle in a clock-wise direction. Then, roll it in a counter-clockwise direction. Once you have rolled it in each direction, you have completed one repetition. Complete six repetitions per foot. Engage your core and lift your legs off the ground. Try lifting them 6 inches off the ground. Hold them up for 30 seconds or as long possible. Relax, and place your feet back on the ground. Repeat this exercise six times. Whenever you see the seat belt sign go off, you should take the opportunity to walk up and down the aisles. Walk slowly to ensure safety. Take your time and just stretch your legs by walking up and down the aisles. Every 20 minutes, walk up and down the aisles for a couple minutes (this is another reason why it's a good idea to get an aisle seat)."

    ],
    "document": [
      "When you bring a new dog home, it is important to let her explore her surroundings. Let her wander inside, or in a fenced-in backyard for some time alone. If she has a crate or other bed, allow her to explore it privately. This will help her feel comfortable in her new home. Dogs are inherently pack animals. When you bring a new dog into your home, you are inviting him into your pack. Allow him to assimilate by establishing a structure. This will make his transition a comfortable one.  Feed your dog at the same time(s) each day. Walk him at roughly the same time too. Be consistent with how you discipline him. It will provide a great source of comfort to a new pet for her to have her own things. The most essential items are food and water bowls, toys, and places to rest.  Food and water bowls should not slide around on the ground. Toys should be safe for dogs. Places to rest can be anywhere for your dog to take a break and be alone, like a crate, dog bed, or just a quiet room with some of her toys. It is important for your pet to meet everyone that he will be living with. You don’t want to overwhelm him, so it is best to do these introductions one at a time. Allow him to smell each person and get used to them. Try placing one piece of dirty laundry from each member of the household near the dog’s crate or where he sleeps. Just like humans, dogs like to feel loved. Studies have shown that pets that receive daily affection have longer life expectancies than those who do not. But petting and playing are not the only ways to show affection to your dog.  Include your dog in daily activities. Allow her to help out with chores by training her to hand you things that you need. Praise your dog when her behavior meets your expectations of her.",
      "Take note of your dog’s symptoms, and exactly when they began. Try to be as specific as possible. Once you can determine the problem, you can begin to  comfort him.  Things to look for include: loss of appetite, lethargy, and vomiting. Use an online “symptom checker” for dogs to help determine possible causes. Call and speak to your vet. Relay the symptoms over the phone and determine the best course of action. If your dog is eating grass, she may have an upset tummy. Eating grass can tickle her throat and tummy and may induce vomiting. This can be very comforting for dog’s with gas or upset tummies. Especially if your dog has diarrhea, dehydration can be a serious concern. Comfort your dog by offering him plenty of water.   Try offering him water straight from a hose or faucet, or water with ice cubes. This might spice things up for him and help him to get more water down. You can obtain an electrolyte powder for animals from any farm store. Mix this with water for additional prevention or treatment of dehydration. You can check to see if your dog is dehydrated by lifting up his lip and examining his gums. If healthy, his gums should be covered with a shiny film. If your dog is very dehydrated, get him to the vet right away. Dehydration can lead to organ damage or even death. If your dog as an upset tummy, feeding rice to your dog can give her some comfort.  Boil one cup of white rice in one quart of water, until mushy. Drain some of the water, and feed this rice water to your dog. This is both soothing to the tummy and hydrating. Feed her some of the mushy, drained rice. You can mash it with a fork for a softer consistency. You can also mix with other food that she likes. Just like in humans, OTC medicines like bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) can soothe diarrhea or stomach symptoms.   Give 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds, or 1 tablespoon per 15 pounds. Do this every two hours.  Ask your vet before giving your dog medicine, especially if they're already on medication. Pepto-Bismol should never be given to dogs with bleeding disorders. OTC medications should never be used on dogs who are pregnant or nursing. Never give Pepto-Bismo to cats! It is not abnormal for a dog to have an upset tummy or other illness once in awhile. However, if your pet is seriously ill, she may need to be seen by a professional.Contact your vet in the event of:  Vomiting or diarrhea persisting more than 24 hours Seizure Difficulty breathing Moaning with pain Trouble urinating",
      "While you may feel compelled to comfort your dog with snuggling, treats, and petting, this can actually reinforce the fearful behavior. Instead, do your best to behave normally, treating your dog as you always would, and pretend not to notice her fear. This may be difficult and seem cruel, but petting and feeding your dog treats when she is afraid is in fact rewarding the behavior you are trying to stop. If your dog cannot see (or hear) outside, it may help him to forget about what's happening. Close any windows, curtains, or blinds to help comfort your dog. Take him to an area of the house where he’s less likely to be disturbed. The sound of music may help to drown out distressing sounds. What’s more, studies have shown that classical music can have a very calming effect on dogs in stressful situations.  Begin with something classical, like Mozart. Experiment with different types of music to see what your dog enjoys. If your dog has a crate, allow her to lie in it during the storm. If no crate is available, create a cozy den with blankets and dog items. Place some laundry that smells like you in the safe area to add a soothing effect.  If using a crate, it may help to drape a blanket over it. Leave the door to the crate open so she doesn’t feel trapped. Don’t close your dog in a room. Allow her to have some space without feeling trapped. \" A thundershirt is a snug garment designed to target calming pressure points. This has a similar effect to swaddling a baby, and can be very calming to your dog when he's distressed.  Place the garment on your dog. Use the velcro straps to tighten. This can also be used to calm him in the car. Engage in fun activities that your dog likes. This will keep her mind off the storm and help her to cope.  Toss a ball. Wrestle with chew toys. Try playing toys that dispense food or treats. If your dog’s anxiety is severe, schedule an appointment with his vet to talk about it. Ask about prescription anti-anxiety medication options.  You may try the dog versions of Xanax, Klonopin, or Diazepam. Most commonly, these are used for separation anxiety, but can also be used for severe noise-induced distress. Follow the instructions your veterinarian provides."

      "See if he wants to do anything special. He may want to have a relaxing day with the family or go out and do something. Take what he says into consideration as you plan his birthday.  If he doesn’t mention anything specific, it’s still okay to plan something fun for him! Asking your dad ahead of time also shows that you haven’t forgotten his birthday and will let him know you truly care. For a more laid-back approach, let your dad have some down time on his birthday. Rather than him doing household chores or yard work, volunteer to do them instead so he can relax. Give him a book or his favorite movie and tell him to rest. He’ll be sure to appreciate it! Light candles and keep his slippers right next to the door so he can relax immediately when he gets home. for a milestone birthday. If your dad is turning 40 or 50, consider taking a trip together to celebrate his milestone! Think about where your dad has always wanted to visit. Whether you get there by car or plane, surprise him on his birthday with tickets or a hint of where you’re going!  Take a day trip in the car somewhere nearby if you only have the day to spend together. Plan the trip in advance of his birthday, especially if you’re going for a prolonged period of time. Remember you and your dad will have to request off for work and places to stay. for an unexpected celebration.  Who doesn’t like a good surprise? Communicate with your family and friends to help prepare the event. Make different plans with your dad on the day of the party to lure him into the surprise. If everyone has kept quiet about the party, he’ll have no idea it’s coming!  If your dad’s birthday falls on a weekday, plan the party for the weekend after since more people are available then. If you throw a surprise party on a different day, still plan on doing something special with your dad on his actual birthday! For a more formal and intimate event, have relatives you’re close with come enjoy dinner as a family. You can eat in or go out to your dad’s favorite restaurant. Have fun conversations and share loving memories about your dad. If you’re out to eat, don’t forget to tell the wait staff that it’s your dad’s birthday. They may come sing and celebrate or they could bring out desserts!",
      "Get up early enough to prepare food and surprise your dad while he’s still in bed. Make him his favorite meal and put some extra effort into it. If he usually has eggs, make them into the eyes of a smiley face and make a smile out of bacon. If he eats oatmeal, put extra goodies in it like fruit with sugar and cinnamon. Don’t forget to wish him a happy birthday right away. If it’s a weekday and your dad has to work, bring a lunch to his place of business and spend time with him. Go when he has a lunch break so you aren’t interrupting his work or distracting his coworkers. Ask a family member to take you if you need help getting there. Hang streamers and blow up balloons to fill your house with color and celebration. Purchase a happy birthday banner or make one yourself with pieces of construction paper. When he gets home, he’ll be surprised by the amount of work you’ve put in. or dessert. Either purchase a box of cake mix or make one from scratch. Decorate the cake with icing and candles once it’s finished. If his favorite dessert is a pie or something else, make that instead. Call your local bakery to ask for a specialty cake. Many bakeries can customize a message in the frosting for a more professional look. Take the time to sit down and enjoy each other in a cooperative or competitive game. It doesn’t matter whether it's a board game you both love or a video game you can play together.  Puzzle and strategy games help promote conversation and problem-solving. Don’t be too competitive. Have fun with your dad. Going for a long walk is a great way to spend time outdoors and to talk to your dad. Hold conversation and listen intently to show that you care about his day. Find a nature trail near you or walk around your neighborhood. Treat your dad to a meal at his favorite restaurant. Tell him to get whatever he wants on the menu. Let the wait staff know that it’s your dad’s birthday. You never know if they have special deals, if they’ll come out and sing to him, or if they’ll give him free dessert! Your dad probably has a favorite meal that your family makes at home. Take some time to learn and prepare the meal for him. Cooking your dad a meal will show him how much you care. Ask your dad to cook with you to spend time together in the kitchen.",
      ". Fold a piece of construction paper in half to form the basic card shape. Write a poem or a message for your dad inside in your neatest handwriting. Decorate the outside of the card with other pieces of paper, glitter glue, or a picture of your dad.  Practice the message you plan on writing on a separate piece of paper first. That way, you can make sure the spelling is correct and you’ll know exactly what to write. Find printable templates for birthday cards online. Record yourself talking about the reasons you appreciate him and wishing him a happy birthday. Do a dance, sing a song, or just do something that will make your dad smile.  Include others in your video talking about what they love about your dad to make a commemoration for him. Post the video as private on YouTube so you can view the video anywhere and at any time without posting it to the public. Be attentive for the months leading up to his birthday. Listen for the phrases “I wish I had…” or “I really could use...” so you have an idea of what he could use. He’ll be happy that you paid attention to what he was asking for. Make sure to stay aware of his purchases up until his birthday. If he needed something specific, he may have gotten it for himself. If your dad likes to golf, buy him golf balls or a new club. If you and your father enjoy doing a certain hobby together, buy him something that you both can use.  If your dad is a handyman, purchase him a tool he doesn’t have. A new tie is a classic gift that a dad will appreciate. Does your dad have a favorite sport? Does he like a specific band? Purchase 2 tickets so you can go with him to spend time together. If the event isn’t on the day of his birthday, give him the tickets as a present and tell him what you’ll be going to. Even if you don’t enjoy an event that your dad would like to go to, he’ll appreciate you spending time with him."

    "document": [
      "Go to your local craft store to purchase paper for your covers and the subsequent album pages.   Create your covers with a decorative heavy paper. The cover sheets should be made of heavier paper like cardstock and should have distinguishing details like patterned paper. Create the album pages with solid sheets of paper that are one color. Sheets should have measurements of 12x12. Divide the 12x12 sheets evenly in half to create two sections of 6x12 pieces. On each 6x12 piece, use a ruler to measure 3 sections that are 4 inches in length. Fold the 6x12 piece against each of the three 4-inch lines and press it firmly to make the folds smooth. Measure and cut the heavy cover pages into two 4x6 cut pieces. Take both of the 6x12 inch sections of paper at their short ends and secure with tape. Fold the paper up like an accordion to discern where the album’s front and back covers will be. The heavy decorative paper from earlier will act as the front and back covers of the album. Place glue at the corners and sides of the page and place them firmly at the front and back of the album pages. Arrange photos on the remaining open pages of the album, placing them on available sheet: front and back. Do not glue photos onto the pages. Instead use photo mount squares on each of the photo’s corners to ensure that they are secure on their respective pages. Make sure that the ribbon is long enough to wrap around the entire length of the album when tying it. Use super adhesive glue to secure the ribbon on the back cover of the album. Tie the ribbon’s ends into a simple bow.  Use your creativity to add designs. Use a glitter marker or a gold permanent marker and fill the cover with different drawings or words that have to do with who you’re creating the album for. Add stickers to the front and back if you desire to or even additional photos. As an added personal touch, glue a metal label holder to the front cover to write a name or date.",
      "Brown paper bags can be bought at either your local grocery store or at a craft store. For the pages, be sure to have at least 3-4 bags to use. Place them so that the side facing up alternates: one side opened, the next side closed. Form the folded bags into a book. Use a hole puncher to punch two holes into the folded paper book: one at the top left corner and one at the bottom left corner. Thread ribbon into each of the holes and bring the ends together in the front of the album. Tie a bow out of the ribbon. Tape or glue the 4x6 photos into place. One photo should fit squarely on each page, front and back. A great way to arrange them is chronologically, but you can also get creative and place photos together that are similar in color. Use leftover wrapping paper or decorative scrapbook paper to add design to the covers. Place dots of glue on the corners of the paper and place firmly and smoothly against the covers.  Write on the front of the book with a colorful marker to use cursive penmanship as a way to name it. Place another photo on the front cover to give a hint of what the album will be about and the kinds of photos it holds.",
      "Have at least 10 printed wallet size photos, 10 blank 3x5 index cards, a ribbon or binding material, a felt tip pen marker, and a hole puncher. Turn the blank index card so that it is on its longest side in landscape position.  The wallet sized photos will be placed portrait style on the cards. Stick the photo to the right sides of your blank index cards. Use this space to write about the people in the photo, the date of the event, or just a title for the photo. Decorate the front with markers or keep the look sleek and clean by placing a simple monogram on it by using stencils for lettering. Place the hole at about ½ an inch from the very bottom and very top of the book. Through those holes, thread a ribbon and tie it into a bow."

      "A smart buyer knows that they have the inherent bargaining edge if they choose to use it: being willing to walk away. A person who isn't willing to walk away from a deal — at any point in the negotiation process — is likely a person who will overpay for their car. A smart dealer may try draw out the process, making you feel like you've invested a good amount of time in a car, and that walking away is the same thing as abandoning that investment. Don't fall for that trap. Know that any time you spend researching or negotiating, even if the negotiation falls apart, is an investment in itself and will eventually pay off. Car dealerships know that they can generally make money off of people who decide to lease a car. The prevailing myth that leasing a car is always bad isn't quite accurate; if you plan on keeping the car for less than three years, it's an okay deal. But if you want to hold onto your car for a good deal of time, paying that lease will usually leave you worse off than if you negotiated to buy the car. If you do decide to take a car on a test drive, keep your emotions in check. Dealers know that people get emotionally attached to cars when they take them for a test drive. When a customer is emotionally attached to a car, they are far likelier to overspend because they are less willing to walk away from a bad deal. Some things you can do during a test drive to control your enthusiasm:  Ask the salesperson for quiet, if necessary. During a test drive, a good salesperson will keep talking about all the features and amenities of a car, trying to convince you it's the best deal. They're trying to get you emotionally attached, do not fall for this trick. If the salesperson won't give it a rest, ask them for silence point blank. Bring your somebody else with you on the drive. Your companion will help you remain analytical and focused on the task of extracting the best possible value for the car. They could also be another BS radar, if the salesperson tries to pull a fast one. Take your time and nitpick. If you're going to buy this car, you should very well feel comfortable in it. Don't rush the drive and ask questions that you want answered. Wait for clear answers. Better yet, tell the salesperson up front that you're prepared to walk away if they bring out a four-square worksheet. A four-square worksheet is a clever mechanism the dealership uses to massage the numbers, getting you to agree on an inflated price. It's a three-card Monte trick the dealer uses. Don't get scammed. on the final out-the-door price. Dealers will try to \"sweeten the deal\" (ostensibly for you, but really for them) by adding on services, perks, etc. onto the price that you initially agreed on, making you feel bad about or guilty about not accepting because it's \"agreed on.\" Don't get fooled by this. You can say something like: \"I'm only prepared to negotiate on the final out-the-door price. If we can agree on a number, I expect that number to be the final number, not the starting point for another negotiation.\" Not all salespeople are slimy and wily, but a lot work in the car industry. Knowing the tricks of their trade will help you be prepared when you sit down to negotiate.  Don't fall for the guilt trick. Don't feel guilty for refusing an offer that you know is bad. A salesperson might make you feel guilty for \"wasting his time\" after taking a test drive. This is their job. Don't feel guilty. They certainly don't, their priority is to make a sale. Know that salespeople will start negotiating with an achingly, ridiculously high number. It's their way of \"breaking\" you, and making you feel like the number they're willing to come down on is actually a good one. If you know the invoice price (the price the dealer paid for the car), don't be afraid to walk away from an insultingly high bid. Know the commission structure. After a \"holdback,\" the salesperson gets about a 10% to 25% cut of the difference between the sales price and the invoice price. The higher the total sales price of the car, the more money the salesperson makes in commission. Decide exactly what kind of car you want to buy. Locate several dealerships in the area that have that make and model of car. Phone each one of the dealerships up and tell them that you're planning on buying such and such a car at 5 PM from the dealer that gives you the best price. Tell them you're not negotiating, aren't willing to come into the office until the price is agreed upon, and that you want an out-the-door prices (taxes, everything included). The dealer may not want to play this game with you, but they'd be missing out on an opportunity to sell a car (something a dealer hates to do). Assure them that if they can give you the lowest possible offer, you'll take their offer. If you're buying a used car from a private seller or even a dealership, ask to take the car to a trusted mechanic to check for performance, accident history, or even water damage. Buying with peace of mind will help you find the best deal. Check if the car was reported stolen, scrapped, or ever recalled before you buy. You can get a full history report at CARFAX.com. Or if you live in the UK, go onto autotrader.co.uk, then \"Get A Vehicle Check\". You will have to pay a fee, but it is worth paying to know the truth about the vehicle you are considering purchasing. Don't put your guard down until you've driven the car of your dreams off the lot. Make sure you understand any contract you're reading, and don't be afraid to ask questions. A lot of the time, a dealership will try to add on $10 a month or even hidden fees to wring extra money out of your purchase. Don't be gullible and trust that the salespeople necessarily have your best interests at heart. If the dealership tries to \"pack payments\" by surreptitiously increasing your interest rate, for example, know that the dealer may be subject to heavy fines, as is it illegal. If you believe you are a victim of packing payments, contact a lawyer.",
      "If you can, try to go on a day/time when the dealership is closed so you can browse freely and not be bothered by any sales pitches or arm twisting. If salespeople do approach you, tell them you have no intention of buying, and are just doing market research, and would prefer to look undisturbed. If they continue to hassle you, walk away and go to another dealership: you probably don't want to buy from a dealership that doesn't respect the customer's wishes. This is called the \"invoice price,\" and it's relatively easy to get on the internet. Arming yourself with the invoice price lets you haggle starting low and going up, as opposed to starting high and going down. It's a much better position to be in. Make sure you find the invoice price with all the available features you want. The invoice price doesn't mean much unless it actually matches the features of the car you're trying to buy. Use websites such as Autobytel.com, VINSnoop.com and PriceQuotes.com to shop for quotes that you can use as bargaining chips when you actually decide to negotiate in person. Many dealerships will also have an online branch that will get you a quote in a couple days; use them! For the best possible bargain, it's essential to have your financial game plan laid out before you set foot on the dealership. This includes:  Knowing your credit score if you intend to finance. You can get a free report once a year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies. If you haven't done so already, get your credit score. Shopping around for a loan from a bank or credit agency.  Getting a loan directly from the dealership can be a bad idea. Get a loan secured before you walk into the dealership; the dealership might be able to beat the price, and if they can't, you know you'll be able to finance your car another way.",
      "Doing your homework, like most things in life, is a good idea, especially when purchasing something as expensive as a car. Often, this means knowing what you want to get out of your car. Make a list of what you're looking for in your new car. Some criteria include:  Age Appearance Performance Safety Reliability Size Comfort Fuel efficiency Cost Resale value Transmission type Engine size Miles/kilometers per gallon Current mileage (if car is used) Color. What aspects of your would-be car are you willing to budge on, and which aspects do you need to find in your would-be car? Many people say they want safety, reliability, and mileage in their car, when in fact they're looking for performance, comfort, and appearance. Be honest with yourself; it will make the buying process much easier. The smell. The feel. The touch. Buying a new car can be like a religious experience, but it can burn a hole in your wallet if you're not careful. Carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of buying new based on your situation:  The advantages:  Freedom of choice. You can buy the car of your dream vs. being limited to the cars that are available. Better financing. If you do decide to finance on a new car, your financing rates could be better than if you bought a used car. Getting new features. New cars are stocked with new cutting-edge features such as interactive touchscreens on the dashboard, additional sensors and reversing cameras. Knowing what you're buying. When you buy new, you have an excellent idea of exactly what you're getting; there shouldn't be any uncertainty lurking the background about the car's history.   The disadvantages:  Spending more money. This one's a no-brainer. You spend more money on a new car than you do on a used one. Immediate depreciation. As soon as you drive the car off the lot, it loses about 11% of its value. This is informally called the \"lemon effect.\" Higher insurance costs. It'll cost more to insure that brand new convertible. Ambiguous information for model year. Is the model you're buying a workhorse or a defective wreck? You can't really know until later on — sometimes much later on. Used cars are a great deal for many people: they're relatively cheap and the consumer has idea of what to expect out of the car. Still, there are some disadvantages associated with buying used. Know them before you pull the trigger.  The advantages:  Cost. Buying that car fresh off the lot sure can be expensive; buying a similar car from a classified listings can be drastically cheaper. Better insurance rates. Insurance companies know that drivers of used cars tend to be more cautious and price their insurance accordingly. Less depreciation. Your car will depreciate less if you buy used, because the initial depreciation was so drastic.   The disadvantages:  Higher dealer markup. Dealers know that they can make a killing on used cars. Buying a used car usually means a significant dealer markup. Higher financing. It usually costs more to finance a used car. Higher/more maintenance. Used cars usually need to be maintained more often and for more money. Unknown mechanical and accident history. When you buy a used car, you don't necessarily have any information on who drove it, how often it was serviced, or whether it got into any accidents. Give yourself a budget, regardless of how much you're spending or what kind of car you want to get. Your budget will keep you from overspending and will tell you when and why to walk away from a bad deal. Take your criteria identified above and the budget that you've made for yourself and start looking. You can look at dealerships, car websites, or classified postings, among others. A couple of things to remember as you begin shopping:  Use the internet. A car salesman's worst dream is an educated buyer: a buyer who knows what they want, does not want to be impulsive, and is aware of what's available based on their budget. Searching around on the internet or in the newspaper can help you achieve this. Save your preliminary results. Saving the results of your research will give you a reference point as you continue to shop, especially if you choose to go to a car dealership. Dealers will have artificially high prices that you can spot if you've done your homework."

      "Can you turn your eyelids inside out? Can you shred like Hendrix on guitar? Everyone's good at something, so take the time to sharpen up with a little practice and show the world what you've got! Musical performances can make for amazing viral videos, but there's no limit here — for instance,  videos of incredible sports moves, martial arts skills, Rubik's cube-solving, and much more can all achieve viral success.   Examples: \"The Evolution of Dance,\" \"Chocolate Rain,\" etc.  Viral Tip: For the best chance at  success, try to limit yourself to things that people can't see from anyone else. For example, being able to dunk on a regulation hoop is pretty amazing, but it's something people anyone who watches basketball has seen before. Being able to dunk over a friend's head, on the other hand, is a lot rarer and more impressive. \" Believe it or not, some of the biggest viral stars in the world are people who simply record themselves playing video games, then share the footage with their live commentary added in. These types of videos, which are called \"Let's Play\" videos, are a form of entertainment that's rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years, so you'll already have a built-in audience if you're able to put out funny, well-made content.   Examples: YouTube channels like Markiplier, PewDiePie, etc.  Viral Tip: If you gain popularity with a Let's Play channel, convert your viral success into cash! For example, some Let's Play-ers make revenue-sharing deals with advertisers, others get sponsored by established video content providers, and still others use digital payment systems like Patreon to take donations from their viewers. There's no beating a cute animal for working your way into your audience's hearts. Cute animals have an almost universal appeal — there's something about watching a baby puppy take its first steps, for instance, that can warm even the coldest hearts. If you have an adorable pet or you happen to stumble across a heartwarming interaction at the zoo, take your phone out and start recording!   Examples: \"Sneezing Panda,\" \"Otters Holding Hands.\"  Viral  Tip: Recording a funny or cute animal video often requires a little more luck and patience than it would take to capture a young relative doing something funny, for instance. It's difficult to predict exactly how animals will behave, even when they're well-behaved, so be patient and keep your camera running! DIY and \"How-to\" videos are immensely popular online. Though these types of videos may not be as likely to get you the internet super-stardom that funny Let's Plays or meme videos are, they can bring their brand of popularity. For instance, the YouTube channel \"DaveHax,\" which contains short how-to videos for basic crafts, routinely gets hundreds of thousands of views per video (sometimes even several million.)   Examples: \"Life Hack\" videos, \"WonderHowTo\" videos, etc.  Viral Tip: For maximum popularity, you'll want to address problems that lots of people have a hard time dealing with. For example, common computer performance issues like slow loading times, bad Wi-Fi connections, and so on are among the very most common customer support issues. It's amazing how quickly pop culture that seems cutting-edge at the time becomes embarrassingly dated. Older music, fashion, TV shows, and so on can be absolutely cringe-inducing with a decade or two of hindsight. Unearthing an old, forgotten gem of retro cheese and uploading it to the internet can be an unorthodox path to viral success, but it's one that can truly pay off if you hit the jackpot — consider how the practice of \"Rickrolling\" became a cultural touchstone based off of a decades-old music video by Rick Astley.   Examples: \"Rickroll\" videos, \"Super Bowl Shuffle\" clips, \"Everything Is Terrible,\" etc.  Viral Tip: Though every decade has its fair share of cheese, for many, the neon-soaked 1980s take the cake. Try watching forgotten 80s junk-cinema classics like Miami Connection for a taste of just how corny the Reagan years seem today.",
      "No matter where you come from, what language you speak, or how you were raised, there's a good chance that you'll chuckle at a video of someone in a scary mask popping out of a trashcan and scaring his friend. Pranks and practical jokes (especially ones that involve physical humor) have a universal quality because almost anyone, anywhere can enjoy them. On top of this, they're very easy to shoot — a simple cell phone camera will usually do the job.   Examples: \"Extremely Scary Ghost Elevator Prank in Brazil,\" \"Drive Thru Invisible Driver Prank.\"  Viral Tip: Use common sense and stay safe when you're shooting your prank. Don't try to shoot anything that could conceivably leave anyone hurt or in jail. See our article on simple pranks for a few ideas to get you started. Simple monologues are some of the easiest viral videos to shoot — all you need is the camera in your computer or laptop and a funny idea to get you started. Most of the most popular viral monologues are funny (sometimes accidentally), so stay away from serious speeches and political diatribes for the best chance of going viral.   Examples: \"Leave Britney Alone\"  Viral Tip: The biggest difficulty with monologue videos is that there's not much for your audience to look at besides your face and whatever is right behind you. This means you'll have to be creative to keep your viewers' attention — use humor or an emotional performance to separate yourself from the pack. In the age of the viral video, you don't necessarily have to be able to belt like Whitney Houston to become a music sensation. Giving a funny lip sync performance over a catchy song is an easy way to get your video noticed online. If your performance is ridiculously over-the-top, all the better!   Examples: \"Numa Numa Song,\" countless Let It Go lip syncs.  Viral Tip: Remember that you don't have to lip sync for the entire song — a thirty-second lip sync of the funniest part of the song can be hilarious, but a four-minute video of the entire thing can be a little much. Don't be afraid to tug at your audience's heartstrings when you're chasing viral success. Cute or heartwarming videos can be immensely popular, and one of the easiest ways to capture pure, undistilled cuteness is to turn the camera on your family. Record something truly adorable (like, for instance, a relative's enthusiastic welcome home after serving a tour of duty abroad) and you will score big with grandmothers everywhere.   Examples: \"Charlie Bit My Finger,\" \"David After Dentist,\" etc.  Viral Tip: If you have young children in your family, you may be sitting on a comedy goldmine. Kids often aren't afraid to act silly, stupid, cute, and earnest the way that adults can be, so keep your camera rolling on any young ones. Can't think of a good idea for your viral video? Put your own twist on an idea that's already popular! At any given moment, there are usually at least one or two video memes experiencing popularity on sharing sites like Youtube, so hop on board before the trend grows stale — simply add your own unique charm to the existing formula.   Examples: Countless \"Harlem Shake\" videos, Downfall spoofs, \"Keyboard Cat\" mashups, and many, many more.  Viral Tip: If you want to get popular off of an existing meme, your best bet is to put your video out as soon as possible. The popularity of video memes usually burns bright, but short. For example, the \"Harlem Shake\" video craze of early 2013 peaked in mid-February with millions upon millions of daily views. However, by as early as the start of March, viewership had fallen drastically.",
      "While feature-length movies are typically beyond the time and budget constraints of most viral video producers, shorts offer a more attainable target. There are no rules here. You can go for a dramatic narrative, a simple comedy setup, or even take an experimental approach by stringing together images and textures without a traditional storyline — it's all up to your vision as director.   Examples: Five Second Films, SNL Digital shorts, etc.   Viral Tip: Sometimes, the key to achieving viral success with a short film is to make it a really short film. For example, the \"Five Second Films\" YouTube channel, which makes humorous clips that run just five seconds in length, has millions of subscribers. These videos are a step above and beyond basic staring-into-the-webcam lipsync videos. Good music videos pair a memorable concept with a catchy song for potent results. Though it's by no means easy to plan, choreograph, and shoot an awesome music video, the results speak for themselves: as of 2014, seven of the eight most-viewed YouTube videos of all time are music videos.   Examples: \"Autotune the News\" videos, \"Here it Goes Again\" by OKGO, etc.  Viral Tip: While you don't necessarily have to make a music video for your own original music to go viral, be prepared for difficulties if you make one for someone else's music — song copyright holders are quick to issue takedown notices for content they believe uses their material unfairly. People everywhere love seeing amazing feats of strength, intelligence, and creativity. Though you'll have to literally be the best in the world at something to break a world record, if you're willing to pick a very narrow category, it may not be that big of a stretch to break the record, so get creative!   Examples: \"Guinness World Record: Most Shirts Worn at One Time,\" \"Tightest Parallel Park Record Broken,\" etc.  Viral Tip: You don't necessarily have to break a record on your own — records like \"Biggest Sock Hop,\" for instance, recognize community organizing rather than one person's individual skill. Viral videos don't necessarily have to be of real people and places. If you're skilled with animation software (like, for instance, Adobe Flash), you can put your skills to use by making cartoons, animated gags, music videos and more. Best of all, animation allows you to depict things that would be impossible to actually shoot with a camera, so you're free to be as creative as you like.   Examples: Potter Puppet Pals, Charlie the Unicorn, etc.  Viral Tip: Don't know how to animate? See our Adobe Flash articles to start learning about one of the most popular animation programs in use today.",
      "Being shot in crystal-clear, high-resolution video as opposed to grainy cellphone footage never hurt a viral video's chances. If you want your video to look as good as possible, be willing to make the investment in professional equipment (or borrow a friend's.) Consider browsing our photography articles for technical information on how to get your shots looking amazing. You don't necessarily have to break the bank to get great-quality footage. For instance, a good-quality voice recorder and an HD camcorder, which is all you'll need for basic videos, will run you about $500. The longer your video is, the greater you'll have to fight to keep your audience's attention. Thus, it's much easier to make a short video go viral than a long one. This isn't just common sense — academic research has found that the majority of videos that go viral are under three minutes in length. Some of the most successful videos ever, like the world-renowned \"Charlie Bit My Finger,\" are much shorter. There's no disputing that YouTube is the most popular video-sharing platform in the world (official data from Alexa, an online statistics company, puts YouTube as the third-most-visited site in the world behind Google and Facebook.) However, it's not the only place to upload your videos. Hosting sites like DailyMotion, Vimeo, and more sometimes offer attractive features to video providers. For instance, DailyMotion is sometimes ranked higher in terms of video quality than YouTube. If you're interested mainly in making very short clips, consider joining Vine, a video sharing app meant for videos up to about six seconds long. Vine has its own active user base, so it's possible to become a viral Vine sensation entirely outside of YouTube (though you'll ultimately be able to reach fewer people.) As a very general rule, people like viral videos that make them feel good about themselves and/or the world more than they like pessimistic ones (though there are, of course, plenty of exceptions.) Academic research has found that, while viewers typically prefer content that evokes a strong emotional response, \"happy\" content tends to get shared most of all. A look at the top 10 most-viewed YouTube videos of all time seems to confirm this: the only one that isn't a music video is \"Charlie Bit My Finger,\" which is certainly lighthearted and funny. Of the music videos, about six or seven would generally be classified as lighthearted, depending on your personal tastes."

      "Your self-evaluation may be what your manager basis your performance review on, or it may simply be a tool to assess how you feel you're progressing. Either way, it's important that you think carefully about what you want to say about your work.  You should never rush through a self-evaluation. That appraisal may end up in your personnel file, or it could be reviewed when you're up for a promotion, so make it count. You shouldn't need weeks and weeks to plan a response, but you may want to take at least a day or two to look back on everything you've done in the last year. Your self-evaluation shouldn't be a giant pat on your own back. It should be an honest assessment of your performance over the last year, factoring in both the good and bad aspects of your work.  Avoid false modesty and take credit for your achievements. By the same token, though, make sure you don't inflate your performance assessment either. Try to frame your shortcomings as learning experiences. For example, you might say, \"I lost three customers this year; however, in the process, I learned more efficient ways of keeping customers satisfied with our performance, which will help keep future customers with us.\" In any self-evaluation, it's a good idea to begin by acknowledging what is expected from someone working in your position at your employer. This helps establish a baseline by which your performance can be evaluated.  If using an open-ended format, spend a few sentences addressing what your position entails. Then address how you actually meet (or fail to meet) those responsibilities, and suggest ways you might improve your work. For example, you might start by writing a sentence or two on what's typically expected from your position. Then spend the rest of the paragraph talking about how you meet, fail to meet, or exceed those expectations. If using a structured or checklist format, your evaluation should already include some general markers of what's expected of your position (usually included in the questions). Rate your work based on how well you actually meet those expectations. Include performance competencies for both your professional skills and your behavior in the workplace, no matter what format you're using. Your self-evaluation should include some aspects of your performance that need work. You shouldn't be self-loathing in your assessment, but you should be able to realistically identify things that you could be doing differently.  If you're not sure about how to write about areas of improvement for yourself, ask a trusted colleague or manager how to proceed with this part of the evaluation. The key is to write about your shortcomings as a learning experience. For example, instead of saying \"I lose a lot of clients,\" you might say, \"One area in need of improvement is managing ongoing client relationships. I've learned from experience that ______ is the best approach.\" Talk about specific instances where you struggled with a project but managed to learn something valuable (ideally after succeeding with that project). While different employers use self-evaluations in different ways, one thing is common: you can use this space to talk about what you want for your professional future. Don't be pushy or demanding, but offer hints of where you see yourself in the next few years at that company.  Talk about the aspects of your current position that you find most exciting. Suggest some different ways that you can focus more time and attention on the things that excite you. Ask about being included in meetings that deal with those exciting job elements, or request time and/or funding to enroll in some type of continued education or training opportunities. For example, you might say, \"Because of my interest in _____ at my current position, I think I might find working in _____ highly rewarding. I believe my skills could significantly help the _____ department. Use these discussion points to subtly hint that you'd like to take on more responsibility at your workplace. Over time, taking on more responsibility could lead to a promotion or a raise.",
      "Before you begin an employee's performance appraisal, you'll need to decide how to review that employee's work. There are several different ways of organizing/structuring your appraisal. Three of the most common include:  Open-ended: Rather than using a rating scale, an open-ended appraisal is an open-ended written evaluation that can include any thoughts that the appraiser chooses to include. This format is preferable if you only manage a small number of people. Structured response: The structured response appraisal is a middle-ground between open-ended and checklist evaluations. It consists of a series of topics/questions within a set of performance parameters, which you fill in according to the employee's performance. Remember that these responses need to be based on observation of results, not speculation of motive or attitude.  Checklist: The checklist appraisal is generally used by managers with a large number of employees to evaluate. It consists of a list of performance appraisals and a numerical ranking of how a given employee performs in each category (for example, on a scale of 1 to 5). Ranking employees in groups against others can be an effective way to recognize low performance. Many company automatically terminate the lowest 10 percent if no improvement is made. It can be very easy to confuse accomplishments and achievements with activities. Activities are what workers perform on a day-to-day basis by coming to work; accomplishments are the results or outcomes of an employee's activities and hard work.  As you assess an employee's performance, you'll need to distinguish between that employee doing their job and actually accomplishing things for the company. Make a point of praising good work on the employee's part, but have concrete accomplishments to praise.  You should especially praise good work if the employee is doing the work of multiple people. Many employees get saddled with extra work after downsizing, yet they never get recognition for that extra effort.  Focus on the entire reporting period (most likely a year). Focusing on one bad incident from the last month and ignoring the last 11 months of flawless work is unfair and unhelpful for most employees. It may seem obvious, but a performance appraisal is only valuable to the employee if it provides specific feedback on areas that need improvement. It should also address specific things the employee is doing well, and provide encouragement in all areas of performance.  Dedicate time to each individual objective being reviewed. Be honest and fair in your assessment, and don't play favorites among your employees. Support every score on the evaluation, whether good or bad, with written comments and feedback.  Make sure your criticism (if any) is constructive. It's not helpful to tell someone they're bad at doing something; instead, tell them how to improve that aspect of their job. As a manager, ask and focus on how you can help employee reach goals. In other words, be people-oriented to achieve high standards, rather than process-oriented. Focus on each employee's strengths and weaknesses, and be sure to give your employee new performance goals for the coming year.  Let employees know that improvement can lead to benefits like a salary increase or a promotion to a better position. If the employee has areas that need to improve, you'll need to give that individual the tools to improve their performance. The best goals are called S.M.A.R.T. goals, an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.  Specific goals should use exact language and target the precise aspects of performance that need improvement. For example, instead of saying \"Make better sales calls,\" you might suggest that the employee work on their tone and pitch with customers. Measurable goals should be easily tracked. You should have a clear indication of what needs to be done, how much change needs to be made, and when it needs to happen by. Attainable goals are realistic and feasible for an employee to accomplish. Rather than expecting an employee to single-handedly turn the company around, you should expect that employee to improve their sales numbers, for example. Relevant goals link the employee's performance with quantifiable results that relate to their function in the workplace. For example, a customer service employee may be asked to increase the number of disgruntled callers they're able to keep as customers. Time-bound goals have a specific start and end date. For example, a time-bound goal might be to improve customer satisfaction ratings within the next six months. Even the most critical performance appraisal should end with something positive. As a manager, you'll have to evaluate the work an employee has done to find something positive you can commend.  It's typically easier to take critical feedback if the review ends with something positive. Think about everything that employee has done over the last year, including how that employee interacts with other colleagues, to find something positive you can praise. While annual reviews are very common, some managers like to follow up with employees between those big reviews. These may be done quarterly or at the mid-year point, but the goal is to evaluate each employee's progress so that the employee isn't blindsided by more criticism during the next annual review.  You can follow up with employees through formal performance appraisals, or informally through a one-on-one conversation with each employee (if this is feasible). Praise improvements and corrective changes the employee has made. Give them credit for all their hard work. Point out any performance aspects that have not improved with your recommendations or have gotten worse since last year's review.",
      "Before you begin reviewing an employee's performance, you should double-check that employee's description in your employment files. If the position's requirements or functions have changed at all in the last few years, that description will need to be updated.  It would be unfair to the employee to evaluate them based on outdated position descriptions. Recognize the work that employee has done and the work they're expected to do this year, not in years past. Update the description to include any special skills or knowledge required to do the work and/or any specific tools or equipment needed. In addition to reviewing the position description, you should also review the essential performance functions of that position. These functions will help you identify your own expectations for that employee. Performance functions vary by job, but they generally include:  Accountability: This covers whether the employee is reliable and consistent. Accountability may include punctuality, ability to meet deadlines, respect for the organization and its employees, and ability to meet or exceed performance expectations. Production standards: These should be objective, measurable accomplishments performed within specific time frames. For example, a person picking stock in a distribution center might be expected to pick 100 pieces an hour. Job knowledge: This may include the employee's professional skills, ability to assist coworkers, and willingness to continue developing their knowledge and abilities. Required knowledge might also include operating, maintaining, and instructing others with special tools and equipment. Communication: This may include communication skills, or it may cover an employee's ability to work collaboratively and seek feedback from other employees. Interpersonal relations: This generally deals with how the employee treats their colleagues, and whether the employee is tactful and respectful of others. Customer service: If the employee's position involves customer service, you may want to include evaluations on patience, approachability, reliability, and the employee's commitment to following up with customers as needed. As you prepare to assess an employee's performance over the past year, it's important to review what you (or perhaps another manager) said about that employee last year. There may be significant improvements made, or the employee's performance may have gotten worse; either way, you should know in advance where things stand. Look into performance reviews for the past three years, especially noting whether such reviews have been performed by other people. Note any employee comments about past reviews. The best way to begin a performance appraisal is to document the work that a given employee has done. Take note of both what the employee has done in their position and how they did it, whether the things you document are good or bad. Reviews should be as objective as possible based upon viewable, measurable results. If subjectivity is required, note justifications in the review.  In order to complete a performance appraisal, you will need to decide on some type of measurable, quantitative method of documenting and evaluating performance.  Any time an employee commits an infraction, it needs to be documented in that employee's personnel file. These infractions should be reviewed and compiled during that employee's performance appraisal.  Tie any performance praise or infraction reprimand with specific rules and policies at work. Make sure all rules and policies are enforced equally for all employees. An important part of the appraisal process for many employers is seeking feedback from each employee's coworkers and from the employee himself or herself. This allows managers to get a better feel for how an individual views their job and how that employee's coworkers view their performance.  Ask an employee's coworkers how that individual performs at work, both independently and in collaboration with others. You should specifically ask about both the accomplishments of that employee and any areas that their colleagues believe need improvement. Remember that co-workers' comments are always subjective and often based upon their relationship with employee. Rather than relying upon single interviews, indicate the use of 360-degree appraisals. Your employees should not go into their performance reviews feeling blindsided. If there are elements of an employee's performance that need improvement, let that employee know in a casual (yet professional) way. Likewise, if an employee is doing a good job, give that person praise when you see them at work. The employer should have written history of any reviews and feedback, with evidence that the employee understands the reason for a negative comment and the expectations for improvement."

      "Sometimes, you may be tempted to pluck the inner edges of your eyebrows. However, when you pluck your eyebrows in this area too much, it widens the space between them. In turn, that makes your nose look wider. By not plucking your eyebrows too much, you'll make your nose look slimmer. If your eyebrows are naturally far apart, you can fill in this area a bit with an eyebrow pencil. When outlining and filling in your eyebrows, draw the line slightly inward on the inside of your eyebrow. Sometimes, just by drawing attention elsewhere, you can make your nose seem smaller. For instance, use a bold lipstick like a dark red on your lips, and people will tend to look there rather than your nose. Similarly, you can highlight your eyes by lining the top with eyeliner and adding a bit of shimmery eye shadow. You can also add contouring to your cheeks to draw attention away from your nose. Apply darker lines where there should be a shadow (in the hollow of your cheek) and highlighter along the top of the cheekbone, then blend them together. The farther you can get your arm out, the slimmer your nose will look. That's because closeup pictures actually distort your nose and make it look bigger. In fact, looking at selfies can give you a bit of a complex if you're not careful; when checking out yourself in a picture, keep in mind the camera may be widening your nose! You can use a selfie stick if your arm doesn't reach quite far enough. The closer you get to the edge of the lens, the more distortions you're likely to get. Aim to put your nose as close to the center of the picture as you can to keep it from looking larger. In addition, try to make sure your chin and forehead are about the same distance from the lens, which will help limit distortions, as well. Putting your nose in profile means you're not seeing it head on. Because of that, it will look slightly smaller in pictures, as you're seeing the side rather than the front.",
      "Put 1 line down the center of your nose, starting at the bridge and going down to the tip. Then, put a line down each side of your nose, running from near the bridge down to the front part of the nostril.  Apply the concealer you use to spot treat your face. If you don't already use concealer, try picking one that matches your skin tone perfectly. To check the color in the store, apply it to the inside of your wrist to see if it matches.  These lines don't need to be perfect, as you'll be blending them in. Dab at the concealer with a blending sponge to blend the lines into your nose. Keep going up and down it until the lines are gone and your nose looks mostly smooth. If you want, you can set this makeup in place up by going over it with a setting powder in a similar shade. Dip a triangular sponge into your bronzer, using the thin end. Set it on one side of the bridge of your nose and run it down to the tip to create a very thin line. Don't worry if you mess it up! You're going to be blending it in anyway. Do the same on the other side.  The closer the lines are together, the thinner your nose will look. Bronzer should be a shade or 2 darker than your skin tone. Pick a bronzer that's matte and in a cool color; it shouldn't have red or orange tones in it, as that will make it look harsh. Dab the lines you've created using the narrow end of a blending sponge, moving down them. Make sure the lines are blended in really well, as you just want a shadow effect, not actual lines. You can also use a blending brush for this purpose. If you do, work in the brush over the lines in small circles. It helps to blend it up into your eyelids, just under your eyebrows, as that's where the shadow falls on your face naturally. Basically, you're going over the light lines you created earlier with the concealer. Use a blending brush to run it gently over your nostrils and then down the center of your nose from the bridge.  This helps blend in the dark lines. Highlighter powder should be 1-2 shades lighter than your skin tone.",
      "Make a surprised \"O\" shape with your mouth, keeping the \"O\" fairly tight. Place an index finger on either side of your nose, one on each nostril. Push each nostril in about halfway toward your nose; you need to still be able to breathe through your nose for this exercise. Turn your head upward. Breathe deeply and blow air out through your nose, flaring your nostrils as you do.  Do this at least 3-5 times in a row to get the full results and repeat it several times a day. It make take a couple of weeks up to several months to see results! Smile as widely as you can; do a big, goofy grin. As you do, push the bottom of your nose upward. Alternate between smiling and going back to your resting face, pressing on your nose the whole time. This exercise may feel kind of goofy, but smiling that wide can also put you in a better mood!  This works the muscles around your nose, which may help slim it. Do 2 sets of 15. Use your index finger and thumb to grasp the bridge of your nose. Then, press up on the bottom of your nose with your other index finger. Keep these in place as you stretch your upper lip down. Alternate between relaxing and pulling your lip down.  This exercise may seem a bit odd with so many fingers on your nose, but it can help work the muscles around your nose! Try 2 sets of 15."

      "If there's anything labrador retrievers love more than food, it is spending time with you - playing, snuggling, or simply following you around.. Don’t neglect your lab if it wants to play or cuddle up next to your feet while you watch TV. Your labrador retriever has not lost its pack instinct. Most likely, your lab views you as the leader or one of the leaders of its pack. So if you neglect your lab, it will be affected emotionally. All dogs are territorial. Your lab is no exception. It's natural for them to bark at anything and everything, but when conditioned properly, they aren't so ferocious. Make sure that you spend some time at home and out in public training your lab.  If you have several dogs, you'll need to gradually introduce your new labrador retriever into the mix. Place them in a room or outdoor space divided by a fence of some kind. Let the dogs get a sense of one another. They learn a lot by smells, so give them 30 minutes or more to just take in their new companion. Next, let them get closer, but keep them on a leash. Do this several times, limiting their exposure to the other animal to half hour increments. Only when you are confident that they won't attack one another should you let them roam freely. Have them play together outside. Let them bond.  The same rules apply to people. If your labrador retriever is going to get used to being around a lot of people, it needs to be introduced into these environments in a safe way. Keep your lab on a leash. Have surrounding people/strangers pet your dog and be kind to them. Tell them to offer their hand to your dog. Dogs love to smell people's hands in order to assess their scent. Do this frequently. Eventually, your lab will learn that people can be trusted. Generally, your labrador retriever will play well with children. However, if you have younger children, you will have to keep tabs on what they're doing with the dog at all times. Make sure the child isn't hurting or threatening your dog in any way or this may result in a physical altercation. Your dog isn't vicious. It doesn't hate your child. It might just feel threatened by it. If it scratches or bites, it is simply reacting instinctually to a threat. Do your best to limit this threat. Be present when your child plays with your labrador. Typically, your lab's favorite toy will be a tennis ball. This probably speaks to their inner \"retriever\". Since your lab was bred to fetch wild game, it makes sense that it would enjoy playing with something that is meant to be retrieved. You can find a myriad of other toys at any pet superstore. Dog toys are a great way for your dog to play and to burn off excess energy without having to go outside and run around. Teach it how to walk on a leash also. Labrador retrievers are an intelligent breed and are often easy to train - especially, when they are younger. A trained dog is more confident and better behaved. In addition, a dog that will listen to voice commands is safer in the event it is ever off-leash. When training your labrador retriever, be sure to reinforce positive behavior rather than chastise for negative. Never hit your labrador retriever. You are trying to build a trusting relationship with your dog, not create a neurotic and scared animal. Dogs that attack people or children without heed are often the product of cruel environments. Don't let your labrador retriever be one of them.",
      "Your labrador retriever has a huge appetite. It loves to eat, so it may carry its food bowl around with them, beg for food, or eat unconventional things. This is normal. The exact quantity of food you give your lab depends on which food you're offering and how many calories it contains. Follow the feeding guidelines on the food packaging, and increase or decrease the amount depending on whether the dog loses or gains weight on this ration.  If your dog is more active than most dogs, then you should increase its food intake accordingly. For instance, if every morning you and your furry friend go for a 5 mile jog together, you should consider giving it more food than usual. Obviously, you don’t want your labrador to become obese. If you cannot easily feel its rib bones anymore, then you are probably overfeeding it. At the same time, you should not be able to see its rib bones from afar. Your lab will get very thirsty after exercise and will need to quench that thirst. It will drink more or less water depending on how active it has been and how hot it is outside. Do not limit your dog's water consumption. Unlike food, your dog will regulate itself. Dehydration can be fatal, so don't take any chances. You lab needs a lot of exercise in order to stay healthy. Walk your lab up to three times a day and if you can, take it on long walks of a couple miles or more. If you have a backyard, make sure that it is big enough for your dog to run around. Small backyards are not suitable for big dogs like labs. Whether your lab lives outside or inside, make sure that it has a space it can call its own. Include a large, durable dog bed. Your lab will paw at the bed constantly to get comfortable. Cheap beds will rip easily and can cause quite a mess. Giving your labrador its own bed will also help you train it to stay off of yours, if you are so inclined. Labradors are a short-haired breed that come in brown, black, and gold. For most of the year, your lab will remain fairly low maintenance. During the summer, you’ll want to brush it regularly — weekly is best — to remove loose hair from its coat. Brushing your lab will also help remove dirt and spread natural oils throughout. Don’t bathe your lab too often. The natural oils in your lab's fur can even help fend off fleas and ticks. Bathe your lab 3 or 4 times a year or whenever its stench gets too strong. Every 2 to 3 months, you should trim your labrador’s nails. If you take your dog on frequent walks, the hard pavement will naturally file its nails down. You can trim them at home or have a vet do it. In general, you can train your lab to sit still to have its nails trimmed. Just offer it a treat after every successful trip to your at-home doggie nail salon. Eventually, your dog will welcome it. Be sure to use proper dog nail trimmers. Human nail clippers won't work effectively. Secure your dog's foot in place and then quickly clip off the nail. Do not clip too close to the base of the nail. Doing so can be very painful and cause bleeding. Make sure that the nail does not curve back into the dog's paw or is too sharp to cause accidental damage. Your Labrador's ears can become breeding grounds for bacteria if not cleaned regularly and properly. Check the dog's ears regularly for any excessive or smelly discharge, and seek veterinary advice if you notice anything amiss. If you want to clean the ears, use a specific product designed for the purpose. Do not use a Q-Tip to clean inside your dog’s ear. One sudden jerk could seriously damage your dog’s ear canal The more active your lab is the more likely it'll have dental issues. Gum disease, loose teeth, cracked/fractured/broken teeth, root abscesses, and tartar build-up are all problems you’ll need to be on the lookout for. Take your dog to the vet for teeth cleaning 1 or 2 times a year. Routine trips to your vet can also help combat terrible breath. Since you are on the receiving end of so many slobbery kisses, this issue has probably crossed your mind and therefore is just one more reason why you should have your lab's teeth cleaned.  Vets suggest that you brush your dog's teeth daily or at least several times a week. Purchase a speciality toothbrush and toothpaste from your local pet shop/superstore or your veterinarian. Several kinds of toothpaste are available, many of which come in tasty flavors - e.g. liver, chicken, and peanut butter - that your dog will enjoy. Introduce the brush into your dog's mouth gently. Use your fingers to lift your dog's lips in order to expose their teeth. Work the brush in circles and go from tooth to tooth. Its back teeth will be the most difficult to get to, so save them for last. Make sure that you brush both sides of each tooth. Reward you dog with a treat afterwards. Every dog needs certain core vaccinations on a regular basis. It is a good idea to take your dog to the vet at least twice a year for routine exams to monitor its health and to establish a good relationship with your veterinary staff. If your pet should get hurt or is not acting normally, it is always a good idea to visit the veterinarian for an exam and medical care if needed. Your vet will also prescribe necessary medicines (topical and supplemental) to help ward off parasites like fleas and ticks. As your dog ages, you may see such health issues as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, or seizures. Your labrador retriever may also experience eye problems. If any of these are happening to your dog, immediately contact your vet and talk about possible treatment solutions or medications. An elderly dog with any such conditions should see a vet every two months or as advised by your vet."

      "Between the price of tickets and the cost of snacks, seeing a movie in theaters can be pricey. Instead of spending a lot of money going out, have friends over for a movie night. Have people bring over DVDs or take advantage of your Netflix account. If you're into seeing movies as they come out, newer movies are often available to rent online. You can rent the newest releases using a service like Amazon, so you can see new movies shortly after they hit the theaters. Board games are a cheap way to entertain guests. If you're broke, but want to do some socializing over the weekend, bust out a deck of cards or some of your favorite board games. Have friends over for a game night.  If you're low on money for snacks, make some baked good or other snack foods using the ingredients you currently have in your kitchen. You can also encourage friends to bring over their own snacks and drinks for the night. Going out to eat is fun, but it gets pricey. If you and your friends want to get together for a meal, why not offer to host a potluck? Everyone can bring their own dish and you can all share. This will cut down on spending for everyone involved.  Instead of going out and buying ingredients to make a dish, go through your fridge and pantry. Challenge yourself to make something without spending any money. If you really want to make the night about saving money, you can make a rule that no one buys ingredients for their dish. This can be a fun challenge that will keep everyone's spending in check. If there's a show you watch regularly, you can have a standing invitation to have your friends over each night the show airs. You can also host a party where you marathon watch your favorite TV shows on Netflix. Staying in and unwinding in front of the television allows you to socialize without spending too much money. As with a movie night, invite everyone to bring their own drinks and snacks. Try to whip appetizers and sweets using only the ingredients you currently have in your kitchen. A swap meet can be a fun event where everyone saves money and reduces clutter in their home. Encourage everyone to go through their closets and find clothing and other items they no longer need. Then, you and your friends can all trade items. This can be a fun way to socialize, cut down on clutter, and gain new things you may need. Encourage people to bring drinks and appetizers to the event. This can make it more fun and prevent you from having to spend on refreshments. If all your friends are going out to an event, but you can't afford it, this can be disappointing. However, you don't have to feel left out just because you can't, say, afford a movie ticket or a ticket to a concert. Make your place the spot for the after party.  For example, say all your friends are going to a concert. If the invitation is extended to you, say something like, \"I can't really afford that right now, but thanks for the invite. I would love to see you guys, so if you want to come hang out at my place afterwards, that would be great.\" Oftentimes, an event will get out early. Your friends will probably want to stay out and socialize, but bars and other places can get pricey. People will probably appreciate you giving them somewhere to go afterwards.",
      "Oftentimes, you go out without the intention of spending money but end up getting hungry. Social events often revolve around food. You may, for example, go to a free concert thinking you won't spend a time, only to be tantalized by the smell of the hot dog stand. You may go hang out at a friend's place and end up pitching in for pizza even though you planned on not spending money. Eating before a social event can help you resist this temptation.  Have a big meal before you go out. Stick to healthy foods that won't leave you hungry later, like whole wheats, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins. This can also be helpful if you're trying to lose weight. You will fill up on healthy foods and won't waste calories on junk food. If you do end up spending a little money socializing, try not to do so at a bar. Bars are notorious for having high prices. The cost of alcohol at a bar is much greater than it would be simply buying alcohol at a store. If your friends want to get drinks, suggest you have drinks at someone's place rather than out at a bar. Even free events can have unexpected costs, so watch out for these. Try to eliminate hidden costs when you can. You may, for example, have to pay for parking at a free concert. You can eliminate this cost, however, by taking public transportation. It's not easy having to budget while wanting to be social. Your friends may sometimes struggle to understand the issue. Try to encourage them to lighten up and spend.  If your friends are trying to pressure you into spending money, say something like, \"I know you guys want me to have fun, but I'm really trying to save right now.\" It can sometimes help to explain your financial situation. For example, \"I'm trying to pay off my credit card right now\" or \"I really need to save up for that new car.\"",
      "If there's a community center in your area, try taking a trip there. Community centers offer provide entertainment options, like movies and games, for free. You can get a group of friends together and make a trip to your community center. Community centers sometimes host free events, like free carnivals. Look up the calendar to your local community center online and see if there are any events happening. In addition to going to events with friends, free events can be a great way to meet new people. Are you currently a student? Are you under 18, a senior citizen, or a member of a well known club or organization? If so, you may get free or discounted admission. Check what kind of specials local establishments offer. There may be certain days of the week you can get into a museum, amusement park, or other attraction for free or very cheap. If you live in a city with a lot of museums, many museums offer free admissions to locals certain days of the week. If you're looking for a way to socialize for free, get a bunch of friends together and go to a museum on one of these days. You can find your city or town's event calendar online. You can also do a quick online search for free events in your area. Not everyone costs money. You can often find free art galleries, concerts, or festivals. If there's a free event coming up, this is a great way to socialize on a budget. Are you a member of a local gym? Are you on the board of a local theater? Do you have a membership at a local art gallery? If so, you may be able to get you and a guest in for free. For example, if you have a gym membership, see if you get any guest passes. If you do, get a group of friends together to go swimming. If you want to go out without spending money, take advantage of the natural beauty in your area. Enjoying the outdoors is always free. Get a group of friends together for some outdoor activities.  Go to the beach with friends. Get a group together for a hike through the woods. Have a picnic at a local park. Go for a bike ride through your town or on a nature trail."

    "document": [
      "A vocalist's range consists of all the notes between the highest and lowest notes they can sing. Within that overall range, they may have specific areas or keys where they are most comfortable singing. Your vocalist should be able to provide this information to you. If they're unsure, you might have to rely on trial and error to find the best transposition. Find the highest or lowest note, whichever is giving the vocalist difficulty. Adjust the note up or down until it falls within your vocalist's range. Then count the number of steps or half-steps between the original note and the new note. If you have both high and low notes that are outside your vocalist's range, you may have to transpose the song into two different keys to make it work. The key in which the song is played will be transposed just as the notes are. If you are transposing into a particular key, you'll already know what key it's in. If you're just moving up a step or two, you'll need to work it out.  If you're unsure about the key, you can use a chromatic circle to find the relation between the keys. These are readily available online. Move counter-clockwise around the circle if you're moving the notes up, and clockwise if you're moving the notes down. For example, if you started in D Major and went up one whole step, your transposed song is in E Major. To transpose the song, you must move each note up the same interval. If the song has other sharps and flats not related to the original key signature, ignore it for now – but mark where it is. Transpose a note with an accidental sharp or flat from where it normally would be in the original key. For example, assume the B note is natural in the original key. If the song has an accidental B-flat, you would move the note from B – not from B-flat. Once you've transposed the entire song, go back to the original score and look for any sharps or flats. Work out how far up or down the original accidental moved the note, and then adjust it that number of steps in your transposed song.  For example, assume the B note is natural in the original key. If the song has an accidental B-sharp, that means the natural B was moved up a half-step. Find that note in your transposed song and move the transposed note up a half-step as well, marking the new accidental. After you've completed your transposition, it's a good idea to play through the song and check to make sure you've moved the notes correctly. Your vocalist also may want to try the song out and see if it's now more comfortable for them to sing.",
      "If you're simply transposing the music to make it easier for the musician to play on their instrument, the transposition process is the same as if you were transposing the music for a vocalist.  Some songs are easier to play on some instruments in one key than in another. Beginner musicians often can play more complex songs if they are transposed to an easier key. If you are playing with a musician who plays a \"transposing instrument,\" however, the process is a little bit different. Transposing instruments are those such as the clarinet, for which a C would sound like a B-flat when played. If you're transposing a song for a transposing instrument, the key of the instrument will tell you how many steps up or down you need to transpose the song. Your interval is the number of steps between the original key of the song and the key of the transposing instrument.  For example, if you have a song written in C that you need to transpose for a B-flat clarinet, you would need to move all the notes up a whole step, since B-flat is a whole step down from C. You also can use a transposition chart, that will tell you exactly what transposition you need if you want the song to sound right on transposing instruments. Now that you know the interval you need, all the notes in the song must be moved the same interval. Mark any sharps or flats not part of the key signature so you can come back to them. Move accidentals up or down from the same tone the note would have had in the original key signature. For example, if the song has a C-sharp and C is normally natural in that song's original key, you want to transpose from natural C. With all the notes moved and no accidentals, you should be able to work out what key the song is now in. If you're not strong on your keys yet, there are charts available online that will tell you. If you're working on sheet music, you'll want to note your key signature at the beginning of the song. Now that the entire song is transposed in the new key, you'll need to also move up any sharps or flats that appeared in the song and weren't part of the key signature.  Go back to the original song and find the accidentals. Work out how far the accidental moved the note from where it normally would be in the original key signature. For example, if your song has a C-sharp and C is normally natural in that song's original key, the accidental has moved the note a half-step. Find that note on your transposed song and move it up a half-step as well, marking the accidental accordingly. If you've transposed the song correctly, when it is played on the transposing instrument it will sound exactly the same as when it is played on a different instrument.",
      "You can transpose chords to a song without necessarily being able to read sheet music. This method is ideal if you want to make a song easier to play on another instrument, such as a guitar. This method also works if you want to move a song up or down to better accommodate a vocalist. Look at the original key the song is in. The number of half-steps between the original key and the key you want the song to be in is your interval. You'll need to move all of the chords in the song that same interval up or down. For example, if your original song is in C and you want to transpose it to E, you'll need to move every chord in the song up four half-steps. The chromatic circle shows the relationship between all the chords. Move along the circle the appropriate number of half-steps clockwise if you're moving the chords up, or counter-clockwise if you're moving the chords down. You also could use a transposition table, which tells you exactly what chords to use. You may be able to get one at a music store, or you can search for one online. Once you've finished moving all the chords up or down to transpose the song, play it through once on your piano. If you're ultimately going to play the song on a guitar or another instrument, you may want to play it through on that instrument as well to make sure it sounds okay. Even though it will be in a different key, the song should sound essentially the same. If anything sounds off, you may have transposed a chord incorrectly."

      "The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's website lists 49 licensed wedding chapels. You look up “weddings” in the Las Vegas phone book or do your own online search. While you can always find someplace to get married at a moment's notice, you should reserve a date and time if you have want to elope at a specific site, since that Garden Gazebo Chapel you want may be booked way in advance. Some chapels are more traditional and others are more fun. For example, at some chapels, you can be married by an Elvis or Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Eloping in Las Vegas is usually all about the chapels, but going to the courthouse is also an option. If the courthouse is busy, you can try city hall. The marriage will still be legal. Maybe there’s a pretty spot in Las Vegas where you and your partner could imagine saying “I do.” Hiring or asking someone to officiate the wedding is another option outside of a chapel or courthouse. Some wedding venues around the city may have an elopement package. Many wedding venues in Las Vegas will have an elopement package that comes with a wedding planner, limo transportation, flowers, hotel accommodation, etc. Call a venue to see if an elopement package is available. Eloping doesn’t usually involve planning, but some planning can happen if you want to involve friends and family. Choose a date and location within Vegas for the nuptials. You don’t have to send out invitations. You and your partner can simply give your friends and family a call and ask if they can be there.",
      "Consider your decision to elope and make sure that you are doing it for the right reasons. There are plenty of people who elope in Las Vegas in the heat of the moment, but you might regret your decision if you don't consider it carefully. Keep in mind that your family and friends might be hurt by your elopement if they were expecting a wedding. You might feel ready at the age of 17, but Nevada law requires that each person be at least 18 years old to get married. There some special circumstances that allow minors to get married. In most cases, however, you need to be 18. You can marry at the age of 16 in Nevada with a parent’s consent. You will need to get a Las Vegas Marriage License. Obtaining a marriage license is particularly easy in Nevada. You and your partner must bring proof of identity with you. You can download and print the marriage license application from the Clark County Marriage Bureau's website, but you must bring it to their office in person.  The office is open from 8AM to midnight daily, including weekends and holidays. Keep in mind that you may have to wait an hour or more on busy holidays. The proof of identity can be a passport, driver’s license, or social security card. Many chapels in Las Vegas will have someone there that is authorized to officiate the wedding. If you’re eloping in a chapel, a clergyperson or court clerk is allowed to officiate the wedding. Keep in mind that on holidays, like Valentine’s Day, many people will be eloping and you may have to find someone in the private sector to do the job. Residents of a country other than the U.S. can get married in Las Vegas, and the procedures and fees would be the same. Marriages performed in Nevada are recognized worldwide, but your home country may require a special document called an apostille to finalize your marriage. Apostilles are issued by the Nevada Secretary of State.",
      "Unless you live in Las Vegas, traveling will be necessary. Think about these plans ahead of time if possible. Decide if you will go by car, plane, or bus. This is a special day, so treat yourselves if possible! If you have the means to treat yourselves, purchase first class tickets and enjoy a glass of champagne or other beverage during the flight. The ceremonies are typically pretty short when you elope, so long vows won’t be necessary. Still, you should discuss what vows you’d like with your partner. You can go with traditional vows or write them on your own. First, check to see if the venue has a dress code. If not, dress however you’d like. This is your and your partner’s day, so don’t let tradition get in the way if that’s not what you want. You can dress “traditionally” for your wedding or choose a theme. For example, you can dress as superheroes or dress in a Western theme. You can go as casual as a pair of pants and a T-shirt or choose to wear a wedding dress or tuxedo. You should also think about how you would like your hair and makeup to be. Would you like a simple updo, a  curly style, or  sleek and straight hair? For shorter and more masculine styles, consider if you’d like your hair combed back or styled with gel for volume. If you wear makeup, consider if you’d want  natural  makeup, like nude lipstick and light blush. Or, consider more  dramatic  makeup, like false eyelashes and red lipstick. You can also go as you are without planning. You don’t absolutely have to exchange rings, but it is something you should consider before the ceremony. Talk about it with your partner and make a decision together. If you decide to exchange rings, obtain them before eloping. The ceremony may be a spur of the moment decision, but that doesn’t mean you won’t want the memories to last a lifetime. Many chapels will have a wedding photographer available that can be rented by the hour. If a family or friend is present, ask them to take photos if a photographer isn’t an option."

      "When evaluating any offer, follow the general advice that if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. While you can certainly find good deals on Craigslist, common sense can help you distinguish the truly good deals from the scams.  Read the listing carefully. If the person gives a reason why they are selling the item for the amount, put yourself in that position and imagine what you would do. You can pretty quickly spot a scam this way. For example, suppose someone is selling a relatively new car for an extremely low price. They claim this is because they were awarded the car in their divorce and have no use for it. However, if you were in that position, you probably would still want to get as much as you could for the car. Since the person's divorce is supposedly finalized, the sale of the car would not affect it. Many scammers are not native English speakers, so their listings will be riddled with errors. The occasional typo or error is to be expected since these listings are created by members of the general public, not professionals (in most cases). However, a significant number of grammatical errors and basic spelling errors is suspect.  This is especially important if you're looking at job listings. Someone who wants you to work for their business would typically be more careful and polished about their listing than someone who was selling an old piece of furniture or a few boxes of clothes. Keep in mind that there are plenty of people living in the US and Canada who are not native English speakers and may post a legitimate listing on Craigslist. If the post contains a lot of errors but seems legit, consider sending the person a message and mentioning the errors or asking if English is their first language. Scammers often place the same listing on the Craigslist sites for multiple cities. If you're suspicious of a listing, go to the Craigslist for a few other cities and search for the same title or wording. This is particularly common with real estate and rental scams.   For example, a scammer may list a 3-bedroom, 2.5 bath house for rent at half the market rate for such a dwelling in your area. You may see the same house listed for rent in multiple other cities. Look for this tactic to be combined with a scarcity tactic. The listing may imply that supplies of a particular item are limited, but the person may have posted a duplicate listing in a dozen different places. Because Craigslist is designed to be a local marketplace, you should have the opportunity to see the thing being sold or leased in person before you commit. If the person is unwilling to let you see it before you give them money for it, you're likely dealing with a scammer.  If the person cannot meet with you or wants to get a third person to meet with you, this could be evidence of a scam. If the person is not available at a particular time, try to work out a time when both of you are available. If the person lives further away or claims to be out of town temporarily, this can also be evidence of a scam. If they weren't in your area, they shouldn't have posted a listing on your local Craigslist until they returned. Craigslist scammers, like other scammers, often pressure you to make a decision quickly. They may imply that they are in some sort of emergency and need to complete the exchange quickly. They will often try to appeal to your compassion and empathy to get you to complete the exchange without looking too closely.  For example, a scammer might claim that they've had a recent death in their family and need to complete the transaction as soon as possible. Or, they may have another person contact you and claim the original person had an accident and is in the hospital and they need to take over the transaction instead. Tell the person that you need a few days to decide whether to go through with the transaction. Do an online search using any of the details you know to see if there are any complaints about the person or if the listing has been used before. These are signs that the listing is a scam.",
      "When you respond to a listing or someone responds to a listing you posted, find out if they are local. If you live in a town surrounded by rural areas, there may be people who live some distance from you. However, for the most part, the people selling things on Craigslist should be local to you.  If the person lives in another state or another country, consider this a red flag. Craigslist is designed to facilitate local exchanges, not long-distance ones. Even if the person is local, if they insist on doing the transaction over the internet, that is another red flag. Be wary of people who are willing to buy an item sight-unseen, or who want you to buy the item sight-unseen. If you post a listing, many of the first responses you get will typically be from scammers. Look for generic language in response, such as \"the item\" instead of naming the item you listed for sale.  Also be on the lookout for overly flowery or formal language. This typically indicates that the person is not a native speaker of English. While that in and of itself is not necessarily a sign of a scam, being overly formal typically indicates that they're trying to butter you up and win your trust. Some scammers will also send messages that seem overly familiar, even though you've never interacted with them before. They may seem desperate, as though your listing is a lifesaver for them, or they may share overly personal details about themselves, their family, or their situation. Craigslist is meant to be a medium to facilitate an in-person exchange between local people. This sets the site apart from platforms such as Etsy or eBay, where you typically complete the exchange online. If the person isn't willing to meet you in person, they're likely trying to scam you.  The person may have a good excuse as to why they can't meet you in person. They may claim that they've been scammed before and want to be extra cautious, or that they had some other bad experience with a Craigslist exchange. However, if their method of caution puts you at the disadvantage, they're probably trying to scam you rather than protect themselves. If they're buying something from you that you listed, they should want to see it in person before they commit to buying it. Most people would, especially if the transaction involves a larger sum of money. If they insist that they'd rather just send you payment and get the item sight-unseen, they're probably trying to scam you. Some scammers will insist that you need to work through someone else to complete the transaction. It may be a friend or relative of theirs or it may be a totally different company or website. they may claim that they want to use this third party for the protection of both of you.  If the person wants to bring someone along with them when you make an exchange, that's different from wanting someone else to complete the transaction on their behalf. It's not necessarily suspicious if the person simply wants to bring someone along for their own comfort and safety. The person may send you a link to a different website to complete the transaction. Don't click on this link – it may be a way to get personal information about you that the scammer can use to steal your identity.",
      "Craigslist is intended as a platform to facilitate local exchanges, similar to classified ads in a local newspaper. If someone doesn't live near to you, they're likely a scammer. This applies whether you're looking at a listing or getting responses from a listing you made.  If you live in a predominantly rural area, people may simply be listing or responding to listings for the closest Craigslist to them. However, they should still be willing to meet you locally. If you don't want to travel a potentially long distance, choose to leave out surrounding areas from your searches. If you're handling a large transaction, some buyers and sellers may feel more comfortable using a guaranteed or insured payment or escrow service. However, if they give you a service to use, it may be a scam. Protect yourself by researching the service before you commit to using it or by offering a service yourself that you know is legitimate. You can find local payment or escrow services with a basic internet search. Simply enter the name of your city or town in your favorite search engine followed by the words \"escrow service\" or \"craigslist payment service.\" Craigslist is simply a forum – it does not guarantee any exchanges or provide any insurance or protection. If someone offers this sort of thing, it's a scam. Most likely, they send you to a site that will use your information to steal your identity.  Some sellers may request information from you claiming they are going to issue an invoice through PayPal or set up a private eBay listing. These also are likely scams. They may attempt to steal your identity or simply run off with your money without delivering the item. These services don't provide any additional protection for a seller who is worried about getting paid. Often a seller will insist that you use another service to pay them before they send you the item you've purchased. If you give the person money before you get the item, you will likely never get the item. Many people try to sell extra tickets for concerts or sporting events on Craigslist. You might even find airplane tickets for sale. While these may seem like a bargain, they are often fake or voided tickets that you won't be able to use. Use a site such as StubHub or Ticketmaster for second-hand tickets, or buy your tickets directly from the venue.  Airplane tickets are issued in the name of an individual who must show their government-issued photo ID or passport to board the plane. If you see airplane tickets on Craigslist, they are practically guaranteed to be fake. Airline vouchers and similar guarantees also typically can only be used by the person whose name they were issued in. For a standard Craigslist transaction, you meet the person in a public place. They hand you payment for the item you're selling and you hand them the item in return. Generally, it's best to deal in cash rather than having them write you a check.  Even cashier's checks and money orders may be forged. While your bank may cash the forged instrument, they will hold you liable if it turns out to be forged. If the person insists on a cashier's check, meet them at their bank to verify that the cashier's check was issued by the bank teller and is legitimate. If you're selling a car, boat, land, or other titled property, do not transfer the title over to the person's name until you have money from them. If the person wants to make payments, write up a contract and do not transfer the title to them until you are paid in full. Some scam sellers will ask you for a down payment or deposit before they meet with you. They might say that they want to make sure your serious or complain that they've already met with several people who ended up not buying the item. If you give them bank or credit card information, they'll likely use it to steal your identity or take more money.  Some scam landlords renting bogus apartments will ask for part of the deposit upfront or send you to another site to pay a fee for a credit or background check. Legitimate landlords often do credit and background checks, but they don't charge you a fee for it (in some places it's actually illegal for them to do so). A scammer will often tell you that they're just trying to save some time or make the transaction easier to process. However, there's nothing difficult about the usual way of conducting business. Insist that you want to see the property before you provide any information about yourself or pay them any money."

      "Heparin is an anticoagulant.  That is, it is a drug that thins the blood in order to loosen and reduce the clot.  To receive heparin, go to your doctor.  They will inject heparin directly with a shot, or connect an IV to your vein in order.  After getting heparin, you’ll need to be monitored closely.  Your doctor will take a blood test (the activated partial thromboplastin time, or a PTT test) each day to ensure you’re getting the correct amount of heparin relative to the results of your blood test. Heparin itself is inexpensive and fast acting, but you'll need to stay in a hospital for anywhere from three to 10 days with this option depending on your situation, which can make it quite expensive. Heparin is also preferred as a first treatment because it is easy to start and stop if there are complications. LMWHs are similar to regular heparins in basically all aspects except two. First, unlike regular heparins, LMWHs are approved for home use.  And secondly, you won’t need to be monitored as closely when using LMWHs.  This means that using LMWHs can save you a lengthy hospital stay.  LMWHs are a bit more expensive than regular heparins, but are more cost-effective in the long term since you will not have to spend time in the hospital or pay for related medical costs.  Common LMWHs include dalteparin, enoxaparin, and tinzaparin. The dosage for these medications varies by weight and if it's for treatment or prevention of clot. These are often used before and immediately after surgery to prevent clots, such as for orthopedic surgery. There are some other medications available that you can discuss with your doctor. The newest pill anticoagulants include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran etexilate.  These drugs don't have the same monitoring requirements as warfarin, or as many food/drug interactions.  However, if you have a bleeding complication, not all of the available medications have a reversal agent. Clotbusters are used for more serious cases of DVT.  The most common type of clotbusters are thrombolytics (also known as tissue plasminogen activators, or TPAs).  While anticoagulants can prevent future clots, they don’t actually break up existing clots brought on by DVT.  TPAs, on other hand, can break up existing clots.  However, clotbusters can be dangerous since they might cause serious bleeding.  The medications are delivered intravenously by a medical professional. Each treatment method has its own side effects.  Side effects of heparin include headaches, rashes, flu-like symptoms, and indigestion.  Osteoporosis might occur, especially in pregnant women.  LMWHs have the same side effects, though likelihood of osteoporosis is much lower.  Side effects of warfarins include rashes, headaches, hair loss, bleeding, and elevated liver enzymes.  More serious – but less common – side effects from warfarins include skin necrosis (dying skin tissue), purple toe syndrome (a condition in which your toes might turn blue or purple due to abnormal blood flow), and extreme bleeding.  If you have trouble staunching the flow of blood from cuts and scrapes, or experience heavy menstrual bleeding, you should inform your doctor.  Immediately report these or any other unusual health developments to your doctor immediately. Your doctor might reduce your prescription or prescribe another treatment method entirely if you react badly to a given treatment.",
      "Anyone can get a DVT, but some people are at a higher risk than others. People at a higher risk of DVT include those who are: Hospitalized or who have recently had surgery. Immobile. Elderly. Overweight or obese. Have a family history of blood clots. Have had recent or recurring cancer. Are pregnant or recently had a baby. Taking hormonal birth control or hormone replacement medication. Have recently been injured. An ultrasound (or ultrasonography) is an imaging technique that uses sound waves to examine how blood flows through your veins.  Ultrasounds are the most common tests used to diagnose DVT.   This non-invasive test can provide your doctor with real-time images of the inner workings of your veins and organs, which can help determine the severity of your DVT and provide a potential course of treatment.  Your doctor might suggest a related technique, a duplex ultrasonography (or duplex ultrasounds).  Duplex ultrasonography is similar to the regular ultrasound, but it monitors movement of blood and other internal objects and fluids.  Duplex ultrasounds can provide more accurate information about the speed and flow of blood.  Your doctor will help you schedule an appointment with a sonographer in a vascular laboratory if they believe you should get this test, usually at a large hospital with the necessary sonography equipment. During the test, a technician will simply apply a thin layer of gel to your legs and/or feet, then wave an ultrasound wand over them.  You might also need to wear a blood pressure cuff. The D-dimer test examines a blood sample for small pieces of clotted blood that may have broken off.  If your physician detects a large number of these clot fragments, there’s a greater likelihood that you have DVT. Contrast venography involves getting a dye injected into a large vein in the foot or ankle, then taking an X-ray or series of X-rays over time.  The X-rays will reveal how your veins are transmitting the blood throughout the body.  If there are any clots, they will appear on the X-rays as areas where the dye is concentrated.",
      "Filters are an appropriate treatment for DVT when you cannot use blood thinners.  The filter itself is a soft mesh device that allows the passage of blood but traps blood clots.  The filter is inserted into a large abdominal vein (the vena cava) and prevents clots that might break up from making their way to your lungs.  Filter installation sounds extensive but actually occurs while you’re awake.  Your doctor will apply a numbing agent on the stomach, then cut through to the vena cava, using an ultrasound to guide a catheter to the precise location.  Finally, the filter will be snaked through the catheter and expand to filter the vein.  There is no need to have the filter cleaned or attended to.  Over time, your body’s own anticoagulants will disintegrate trapped blood clots.  Some filters are removable, but most are permanent.  Even the removable filters are usually kept in the vein if your likelihood of developing DVT again remains high.  Your doctor will help you decide whether you need a permanent or a removable filter. Compression stockings are specialized apparel that keep the legs and feet from swelling.  Compression stockings can prevent swelling of the legs and feet that is so often a consequence of DVT.  They can also reduce the likelihood of future clots by increasing the pressure in your legs.  To use compression stockings, simply slip them over your foot and up your leg just as you might with knee-high socks or stockings. Compression stockings are usually worn during the day for two or three years.  If your DVT persists, you might need to wear compression stockings for an even longer time. Get regular exercise.  Aim for 30-60 minutes of cardio exercise each day.  Biking, walking, and running are all examples of cardiovascular exercise that could help you correct or reduce the likelihood of worsening your DVT.  Try to take the stairs instead of the elevator.  In addition:   Get up frequently if you have a desk job.  Take a quick walk around the office in order to prevent clots from forming in your legs. See a doctor regularly.  Your doctor will be able to provide specialized recommendations based on your particular medical history and background that could help you prevent and recover from DVT. Sleep with your legs raised slightly.  If you sleep with your feet elevated even a few inches above the level of your hip when lying down, your blood will more easily return from the legs and back to your body.  Prop your legs up by placing a pillow beneath your feet."

      "Researching the Report",
      "Selecting Your Topic"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Read the report from beginning to end, trying to imagine that you’re a reader that has never heard this information before. Pay attention to whether the report is easy to follow, and whether the point you’re making comes across clearly. Also, look for whether your evidence supports your thesis. A good question to ask yourself is, “If I were someone reading this report for the first time, would I feel like I understood the topic after I finished reading? No matter how good your information is, your report will seem amateur and messy if it’s full of spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Writing your report in a word processor with a built-in spell checker can help you catch mistakes as you're writing, but there’s no substitution for thorough proofreading. Try reading the report to yourself out loud. Hearing the words can help you catch awkward language or run-on sentences you might not catch by reading it silently. No matter how carefully you think you’ve read through your report, sometimes you can accidentally skim over text that you’ve already read several times. After you’ve finished proofreading your report, try reading it again, but this time, read it backward. Start with the last sentence of the report, then the one before that, and so on. This is a great trick to find spelling errors or grammatical mistakes that your eye would otherwise just scan over. Having a second pair of eyes can be helpful when you’re proofreading, especially after you’ve already read the report several times. If you can find someone willing to proofread the report for you, ask them to point out any spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and awkward language, as well as whether your point is clear. Ask your helper questions like, “Do you understand what I am saying in my report?” “Is there anything you think I should take out or add?” And “Is there anything you would change?” All of your hard work deserves to be rewarded, so don't risk losing points because you didn't do the assignment correctly. Go through the assignment checklist or rubric to make sure your paper meets the requirements for full credit. If you have any questions about the assignment requirements, ask your instructor. It's important to know how they'll be grading your assignment.",
      "It can be helpful to format the font, margins, and spacing of your report before you start writing it, rather than trying to go through and set it all up at the end. Then, as you’re writing out paragraphs, go ahead and put in a citation every time you include information from one of your sources. That way, you don’t forget to do it after you’re finished.  Try to follow any formatting instructions to the letter. If there aren't any, opt for something classic, like 12-point Times New Roman or Arial font, double-spaced lines, and 1 in (2.5 cm) margins all around.  You'll usually need to include a bibliography at the end of the report that lists any sources you used. You may also need a title page, which should include the title of the report, your name, the date, and the person who requested the report. For some types of reports, you may also need to include a table of contents and an abstract or summary that briefly sums up what you’ve written. It’s typically easier to write these after you’ve finished your first draft. Your intro is where you introduce your topic and state your thesis. Your introductory paragraph should be engaging, since you want the reader to be interested in reading the rest of your report. You should provide some background information on your topic, then state your thesis so that the reader knows what the report is going to be about.  Example Intro for Thesis 1: “The Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE) of 1915 was intended to celebrate both the creation of the Panama Canal, and the technological advancements achieved at the turn of the century. The three main halls of the PPIE were filled with modern creations of the day and were an excellent representation of the innovative spirit of the Progressive era.” The body paragraphs are where you state the evidence that supports your thesis. Each body paragraph consists of a topic sentence and evidence supporting the topic sentence. The topic sentence introduces the main idea of the body paragraph and links the paragraph back to the thesis.  Typically, you should present the most important or compelling information first. Example topic sentence for Thesis 1: At the PPIE, the Court of the Universe was the heart of the exposition and represented the greatest achievements of man, as well as the meeting of the East and the West. After you write your topic sentence in the body paragraph, provide evidence found in your research that supports your topic sentence. Incorporate this research using a mixture of paraphrases and direct quotes. By linking the text of each body paragraph to the topic sentence, you’ll keep your report well-organized, and it will flow better.  Paraphrasing means restating the original author's ideas in your own words. On the other hand, a direct quote means using the exact words from the original source in quotation marks, with the author cited. For the topic sentence listed above about the Court of the Universe, the body paragraph should go on to list the different exhibits found at the exhibit, as well as proving how the Court represented the meeting of the East and West. Use your sources to support your topic, but don't plagiarize.  Always restate the information in your own words. In most cases, you'll get in serious trouble if you just copy from your sources word-for-word. Also, be sure to cite each source as you use it, according to the formatting guidelines you were given. Commentary is your own ideas about your topic and the evidence. Analyze the evidence to explain how it supports the ideas presented in your topic sentence, then clearly link it back to your thesis. This helps the reader follow your train of thought, which makes your argument stronger. Your commentary needs to be at least 1-2 sentences long. For a longer report, you may write more sentences for each piece of commentary. This paragraph both summarizes your thesis again and provides your final thoughts on your topic. It should reiterate to the reader what they should be taking away from your report, and should reinforce the significance of the information you’ve presented. Avoid presenting any new information in the conclusion. You don’t want this to be a “Gotcha!” moment. Instead, it should be a strong summary of everything you’ve already told the reader.",
      "If the report guidelines give you a number of sources to use, or a limit on how many of a specific type of source you can use, be sure to follow those guidelines carefully. No matter how good your writing is, if you don’t source your report properly, you won’t get good feedback. Any sources you need should be authoritative, like books, newspapers, or scholarly articles written on the subject.  If you don’t have guidelines on how many sources to use, try to find 1-2 reputable sources for each page of the report. Sources can be divided into primary sources, like original written works, court records, and interviews, and secondary sources, like reference books and reviews. Databases, abstracts, and indexes are considered tertiary sources, and can be used to help you find primary and secondary sources for your report.  If you’re writing a business report, you may be given some supplementary materials, such as market research or sales reports, or you may need to compile this information yourself. Even if you’re allowed to use online sources, the best place to start doing research is the library. Visit your school’s library, a public library in your area, or even a nearby college or university library when you’re getting ready to start your report. Search the library’s database to gain access to books, scholarly journals, periodicals, and other sources that might not be available online.  Librarians are an excellent resource when you're working on a report. They can help you find books, articles, and other credible sources. Often, a teacher will limit how many online sources you can use. If you find most of the information you need in the library, you can then use your online sources for details that you couldn’t find anywhere else. Since anyone can write something and put it online, it can be hard sometimes to sift through all of the material on the internet to find authoritative sources. To ensure you’re getting high-level sources, start by using an academic search engine, like Google Scholar, Lexis Nexis, or your school’s recommended search engine, which may require a username and password. Examples of authoritative online sources include government websites, articles written by known experts, and publications in peer-reviewed journals that have been published online. Often, if you come across an article on the subject you’re researching, you can use the sources that the author used to help you with your own report. For instance, if you’re reading an article that mentions a previous publication on the same subject, see if you can find that one as well. You might find some new information that will help you have a better understanding of your subject. If you’re using a book as one of your sources, check the very back few pages. That’s often where an author will list the sources they used for their book. If you find something helpful in a book, article, or another source, write down everything you might want to remember for your report. Then, write down all of the information you can find on the source, including the author, the date of the publication, the page number, and the publisher. This will help you easily create your bibliography later, since the citation information will be listed right in your notes.  Remember to number each page of your notes, so you don’t get confused later about what information came from which source! Remember, you’ll need to cite any information that you use in your report; however, exactly how you do this will depend on the format that was assigned to you. As you’re researching your paper, you should notice a main theme emerging in your notes. Use this theme to write a strong thesis statement for your report. Your thesis statement should summarize what you want to prove in your report for your reader, and all of the body paragraphs should tie back to this idea.  For most reports, your thesis statement should not contain your own opinions. However, if you're writing a persuasive report, the thesis should contain an argument that you will have to prove in the body of the essay. An example of a straightforward report thesis (Thesis 1) would be: “The three main halls of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition were filled with modern creations of the day and were an excellent representation of the innovative spirit of the Progressive era.” A thesis for a persuasive report (Thesis 2) might say: “The Panama-Pacific International Exposition was intended as a celebration of the Progressive spirit, but actually harbored a deep racism and principle of white supremacy that most visitors chose to ignore or celebrate.” Once you’ve decided on the thesis statement for your report, it’s time to start organizing your notes into the main structure you’ll use for your report. Begin with your thesis statement, then pick 3 or 4 major ideas related to your thesis statement that you will want to cover in your essay. Write down details from your notes that support each of those main ideas.  The purpose of an outline is to help you to visualize how your essay will look. You can create a straightforward list or make a concept map, depending on what makes the most sense to you. Try to organize the information from your notes so it flows together logically. For instance, it can be helpful to try to group together related items, like important events from a person’s childhood, education, and career, if you’re writing a biographical report. Example main ideas for Thesis 1: Exhibits at the Court of the Universe, Exhibits at the Court of the Four Seasons, Exhibits at the Court of Abundance.",
      "If your teacher, professor, or boss gave you guidelines for your report, make sure you read them thoroughly to make sure you understand the assignment. Generally, the prompt will give you information such as whether your report should be informative or persuasive, who your audience should be, and any issues your report should address.  The guidelines will also typically tell you the requirements for the structure and format of your report. If you have any questions about the assignment, speak up as soon as possible. That way, you don’t start working on the report, only to find out you have to start over because you misunderstood the report prompt. Typically, you’ll have some leeway in what your report will be on. If you pick a subject you’re interested in, you’ll be more engaged during the research and the writing process. This often results in a report that’s more fun to read, so you’ll likely get better feedback or a higher grade.  For instance, if your report is supposed to be on a historical figure, you might choose someone you find really interesting, like the first woman to be governor of a state in the U.S., or the man who invented Silly Putty. Even if you don’t have the option to choose your topic, you can often find something in your research that you find interesting. If your assignment is to give a report on the historical events of the 1960s in America, for example, you could focus your report on the way popular music reflected the events that occurred during that time. If you write about too broad of a topic, your report will seem disorganized, since you’ll be trying to cover too much information all at once. On the other hand, your topic shouldn’t be so narrow that you can’t find anything to write about. Try to find one aspect of the topic that has a lot of supporting details.  If you’re not sure what to write about at first, pick a larger topic, then narrow it down as you start researching. For instance, if you wanted to do your report on World Fairs, then you realize that there are way too many of them to talk about, you might choose one specific world fair, such as the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, to focus on. However, you wouldn’t necessarily want to narrow it down to something too specific, like “Food at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition,” since it could be hard to find sources on the subject without just listing a lot of recipes."

      "It's important to treat others how you want to be treated. If it hurts you when your sister is mean to you, why would you want to cause her that same pain by being mean to her? Being a kind little sister or brother is the first step in getting your older sister to be nice to you. Avoid interacting with her when you're feeling angry. If you're in a bad mood, you're bound to take it out on her. Being mean to her will only make her be mean to you. Although you are younger, that doesn't mean you have to be immature. Even if your sister is being mean to you, that doesn't make it right for you to be mean back. Instead of fighting back when your sister starts an argument, it's best for you to just walk away. Pick your battles. If your sister tries to start a fight, think about the importance of this fight before you engage. Do you really care about winning this argument? Does the outcome matter to you? Don't waste your time and effort arguing over something stupid. Doing things like helping your sister with her chores or offering to help her practice her sport or hobby are great ways to show your sister that you're making an effort to improve your relationship. Hopefully your sister will realize that you are trying to be kind and will, in turn, try to be kind to you.  Don't do all of your sisters chores and don't let her take advantage of you. It's best to help with tasks that can benefit from two people. For example, washing and drying dishes. If your sister is in a school play, offer to run lines with her. Or if she plays soccer, offer to practice with her. Since you and your sister are completely different people, you're most likely good at different things. Maybe you're skilled at basketball and your sister is an aspiring actress. Maybe you get great grades and your sister is captain of her volleyball team. Whatever your differences are, embrace them instead of comparing them.  For example, don't rub it in your sister's face whenever you get a good grade. Your sister may be self conscious about getting lower grades than you, so don't make her feel bad. Celebrate your sister accomplishments instead of belittling them. If your sister had a great volleyball game, congratulate her instead of being jealous.",
      "Your older sister may push you away because you are younger. However, showing her that the two of you have common interests may prove to her that your age difference isn't such a big deal. Try to find certain activities, movies, music, or hobbies that you and your sister both enjoy. If your sister starts to enjoy spending time with you, she'll most likely start being nicer to you. For example, when your sister isn't busy, ask her if she wants to kick a soccer ball around the backyard or watch music videos on YouTube.  Try watching a weekly TV show together. This will give the two of you some designed sister time while watching a show that you both enjoy. If you both enjoy baking, try baking brownies or cupcakes together. If your sister sees that you are making an effort to learn about her interests, she may begin to gain respect for you. You can show your sister that you're interested in their life by asking inquisitive questions, giving encouragement, and acknowledging things that are important to them.  If your sister has a new favorite album, ask her what some of her favorite songs are. Or ask your sister how her day was at school. Encourage your sister when she seems sad by saying \"I don't know why you're feeling down, but I know you can get through it!\" Or give her some encouragement if she'd feeling nervous about something (let's pretend it's sports) by saying \"I know you're nervous about the big game, but I know you'll do great!\" Siblings usually have many differences, even if they've grown up in the same household. Dealing with the differences of age, gender, personality, talents, or interests will help you learn to better relate to others. Instead of hating your differences, learn from them. Finding out what sister cares about most may help you view things differently. Get your sister to appreciate your differences by showing her that you respect her differences. It might take awhile, but your sister will eventually learn to appreciate you for who you are.",
      "Even though she is really hurting your feelings, your sister may think that she is just joking or playing around with you. It's important that you tell her how her actions are making you feel. Make sure she knows that you are serious and not joking around with her.  Be inviting and relaxed when you approach your sister to talk. When you want to talk with your sister, say \"I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes.\" Tell her how she hurts you and why those actions you feel so bad. Say to your sister \"It really hurts my feelings when you ______. It hurts my feelings because _____.\" Big sisters are easily annoyed with younger siblings, so ask your sister if there is something you are doing that is causing your sister to be mean to you. Then, figure out how to fix your actions.  Say to your sister \"I really want to improve our relationship. Have I done anything to upset or annoy you?\" Once she gives you an answer, ask what you can do to be a better sister. Say \"What can I do to be a better sibling to you? I really want us to stop fighting so much.\" Even though serious conversations are necessary to resolve conflict, bonding over fun and casual conversations is important too.  Compliment her on her shoes, tell her that you like the posters she has hung up in her room, ask her about the boy/girl she likes at school. Have a fun conversation with your sister to help you two bond.  Be sure to let your sister know that you enjoy spending time with her and that you'd like to do it more often. Big sisters typically like to give advice. If you ask her for advice about fun things like fashion, love, or music, she'll enjoy talking with you.",
      "Sharing a room, or even living under the same roof, as your siblings can be aggravating. It's important that you each get a couple hours a day to yourself. If need be, spend some additional time doing homework at a friend's house or at the library to allow you and your sister to some space from  one another. Everyone needs their own space, their own friends, and their own life. Let your sister enjoy her personal time without bothering her. If she sees that you're giving her space, she'll be more inclined to spend time with you when she doesn't have company over.  Younger siblings often annoy big sisters and their friends. Don't be that kind of younger sibling! Only hang out with your sister and her friends if they invite you. If you don't annoy them by bothering them all the time, they may start inviting you to hang out with them all of the time It's important that you have your own friends as well. Think about how you would feel if you were constantly bothered by your sister while you're with your friends. Treat her how you would like to be treated. It's often said that space allows the heart to grow fonder – this reigns true with siblings as well! Allow her to miss you, all her to want to spend time with you. Even if your big sister doesn't know it, she will miss you if you're not around all time.  If your sister approaches you, it will most likely be in a positive way. Wait for her to initiate an interaction instead of always approaching her first. You deserve to have your own life, so enjoy it! Have your own friends and your own hobbies, as this will prove to your sister that you are an individual, not just her annoying little sister."

      "You can access the Device Manager from the Control Panel. It will be located in the System and Security section if you are using Category View. In your Device Manager, you will see a list of all of the hardware installed on your computer. These are sorted into categories. Expand the Network Adapters section to see all of your installed network adapters. If you are not sure which adapter you are using, see Step 1 of the second method to find your device's Description. Select Properties from the menu to open the network adapter's Properties window. Look for the \"Network Address\" or \"Locally Administered Address\" entry. Highlight it and you will see a \"Value\" field on the right. Click the radio button to enable the \"Value\" field. Not all adapters can be changed this way. If you can't find either of these entries, you will need to use one of the other methods in this article. MAC addresses are 12-digit values, and should be entered without any dashes or colons. For example, if you want to make the MAC address \"2A:1B:4C:3D:6E:5F\", you would enter \"2A1B4C3D6E5F\". You can also disable and re-enable your adapter within Windows for the change to become effective without rebooting. Just sliding the Wi-Fi's On/Off switch like the slider found on ThinkPads and VaiOs won't satisfactorily disable/re-enable the card. Once you've rebooted the computer, open the Command Prompt and enter ipconfig /all and note the Physical Address of your adapter. It should be your new MAC address.",
      "In order to easily identify your network adapter in the Windows Registry, you'll want to gather some basic information about it through the Command Prompt. You can open the Command Prompt by typing \"cmd\" into the Run box (Windows key + R).  Type ipconfig /all and press Enter. Note the Description and Physical Address for the active network device. Ignore devices that aren't active (Media Disconnected). Type net config rdr and press Enter. Note the GUID, which is displayed between the \"{}\" brackets next to the Physical Address you recorded earlier. You can start the Registry Editor by opening the Run dialog box (Windows key + R) and typing \"regedit\". This will open the Registry Editor, which will allow you to change the settings for your network card. Making incorrect changes to the registry can cause your system to malfunction. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}. Expand it by clicking the arrow. There will be several folders labeled \"0000\", \"0001\", etc. Open each of these and compare the DriverDesc field to the Description you noted in the first step. To be completely sure, check the NetCfgInstanceID field and match it with the GUID from the first step. For example, if the \"0001\" folder matches your device, right-click on the folder. Select New → String Value. Name the new value \"NetworkAddress\". In the \"Value data\" field, enter your new MAC address. MAC addresses are 12-digit values, and should be entered without any dashes or colons. For example, if you want to make the MAC address \"2A:1B:4C:3D:6E:5F\", you would enter \"2A1B4C3D6E5F\".. Some adapters (especially Wi-Fi cards) are unforgiving of MAC addresses changes if the first octet's 2nd half isn't a 2,6,A,E or begins with a zero. This requirement has been observed as far back as Windows XP and is formatted as:  D2XXXXXXXXXX D6XXXXXXXXXX DAXXXXXXXXXX DEXXXXXXXXXX You can also disable and re-enable your adapter within Windows for the change to become effective without rebooting.

      "The hot water cleanses your skin and opens your pores, providing a good base for the cologne. It won't smell good mixed with dirty skin, and if you spray it on dry it may not last as long. If your cologne has a spray bottle, do not spray right next to your skin; you don't want the liquid dripping down your shirt. It'll be way too strong, so hold it a few inches from your body and give yourself a light squirt. If your bottle doesn't have a spray nozzle, use the dabbing method. Cover the open bottle with your finger, tip the bottle, then right the bottle and put it down. Dab the liquid on your finger in the area where you wish to apply the cologne.  One small dab is sufficient; don't double-dab. Wash your hands after using this method, so you don't get cologne smell on everything you touch. This changes the way the cologne smells and makes the scent go away faster. Instead of rubbing the cologne, just spray or dab it on and let it dry on the skin. You shouldn't wear cologne with strongly-scented deodorant or aftershave. The smells might not go well together, and the combination could leave you smelling like a department store perfume counter. You'll quickly grow used to the smell of your cologne, to the point where you might think it's completely worn off. Other people, however, will still be able to smell it. You probably don't need to apply cologne more than once a day, right before you go out. If you absolutely feel the need to put on some more, keep it light.",
      "These are the areas of your body that produce a lot of body heat.  The heat will cause the fragrance to continue to smell good all day long. If you just put the cologne on your clothes, it may not be detectable for long.  The insides of your wrists are a good spot for cologne. Behind the ears is another spot that many men like to utilize. This is a great place to apply cologne since it scents your shirt and provides a nice burst of scent to whomever you might end up hugging. If you're relatively sure your date's head may be close to your neck at some point during the evening, be sure to dab some cologne on your neck for good measure. Cologne applied here mixes with your natural scent, creating a unique smell that is truly you. If you tend to get body odor, don't use cologne as a way to mask it. Less appealing smells don't mix well with cologne, so it's best not to layer it on in the wrong areas. You don't have to put cologne on every pulse point; in fact, if you do so your scent will probably be overwhelming for those around you. Choose a few spots, and keep it subtle.",
      "Cologne is not necessary at work, but it's generally acceptable. A big event, such as a wedding, funeral, party, or night out on the town, might easily call for cologne.  Be aware of how your body's oils interact with your cologne. If you're going clubbing, for example, it may not be the best idea to apply lots of cologne: your natural body odor mixed with cologne may be even worse smelling than just your natural body odor. Some people are allergic to cologne. You'll need to be sensitive of this potential issue when working in an office or spending time in other indoor areas. Any other reason to wear cologne (\"Because I want to feel like a man,\" \"Because my friend is doing it,\" etc.) is pointless. That being said, apply it when you feel like it and enjoy your scent. Many men prefer to wear one cologne during the day, at work, and a completely different one when they go out. Some sources recommend a lighter, citrus-based scent for afternoons and workplace environments, and a stronger scent with spice undertones or musky notes for the night."

      "Try to get one of those fabric coated hair ties instead of a rubber band. They are much sturdier, and will last must longer. For a plain scrunchie, use some cotton or jersey knit fabric. It can be solid colored or have a small print on it. For a fancier scrunchie, try some stretch velvet instead. Don't worry; you will be turning the fabric inside out, after you sew it. You will need to scrunch the fabric up in order to get it to wrap around the hair tie. When you are done, the long, raw edges of the rectangle should be inside the hair tie. The folded part should be on the outside. The hair tie should be sandwiched inside the folded rectangle, touching the right sides of the fabric. Pin the top right corner to the bottom right corner. Pin the top left corner to the bottom left corner. You can also pin the fabric along the long edge, if you'd like. Try to use a thread color that closely matches the fabric's color. You can do this by hand, using very small stitches, or on a sewing machine. Do not stitch the narrow ends together. When you are done, you should have a tube around the hair tie. Again, you may have to scrunch the tube up to get it to fit. Remove the pins when you are done. Attach a safety pin to one of the narrow edges. Tuck it inside the tube. Scrunch as much fabric as you can onto the safety pin, and pull the pin through the tube. Keep doing this until the safety pin reaches the other side of the tube. When you are done, the seam should be on the inside, and the right side of the fabric should be facing you. Remove the safety pin when you are done. Make sure you do this on both sides of the tube. This will help give you a nicer seam when you are done. Make sure you sew all along the edge of the tube, and be careful not to sew through the hair tie. You will need to do this by hand. ",

    "document": [
      "Everyone grieves in a completely different manner and over a completely unique time period. Don’t focus on how long the grieving period should take based on the length of the relationship or anything else like that. Accept that your friend will need to find his or her own way and in his or her own time. This process is likely to continue testing your patience, but you simply cannot force the situation to click. It’ll click when the person is ready for it to. Grief often feels all-encompassing in a way that may make your friend put off going grocery shopping or keeping up with other errands that we all hate to do even when we’re not getting over a breakup. While you shouldn’t mother your friend completely, offering to pick up some basic necessities or even help with the laundry can mean more to the person than you might think. By offering briefly to take something even so simple and mundane off your friend’s plate, you will help in a way most others won’t even offer. While you should allow the friend to work through the pain and sadness in the short term, don’t feel as though you cannot have fun together in the weeks and months after the breakup. Especially in cases of long-term relationships and cohabitation, being single again can feel a bit to anyone as though they’ve lost part of themselves or their identity. If you and the friend had standing dinner plans on the same night every week or other common friend rituals, resume them as soon as the friend seems ready.  These gestures can reestablish a sense of normalcy that helps the friend move on. Remember that getting over someone isn’t a perfectly linear process. Even after resuming fun routines, your friend will still have good and bad days. Resist the urge to push or cajole to get the process back on track. The friend is still seeking a safe, nonjudgmental place in your friendship.  This may be the perfect time for you to try out a new adventure together. Sign up for a new experience, like a hot balloon ride, or leave town for the weekend. While not advisable, we all know it’s perfectly normal give in to a night or two of too much to drink after a breakup. However, as the immediate breakup turns into the long process of moving on, ensure that your friend doesn’t appear to be finding too much solace in drugs or alcohol. In addition to the risks of dependence, a healthy body will help lead to a healthy mind much more quickly, and no one sleeps, eats, or exercises enough when they party too often. Though your friend should not avoid or repress the pain and sadness of the breakup, those feelings often find other outlets in the weeks and months that follow. Channeling negative emotions into positive activities is a process referred to as sublimation. Find out the activities your friend is using to sublimate the hurt feelings and encourage them. The person might be exercising more, taking up painting or an instrument, or even doubling down on working toward a promotion. Offer your friend plenty of positive reinforcement for the productive ways in which he or she has managed the situation. In most people’s grieving process, anger comes after the confusion, denial, and sadness involved with a breakup. Anger usually means your friend has accepted the rejection and moved past the immediate loss. While your friend obviously shouldn’t be driven to negative or violent action based on his or her anger, being mad alone is not a sign of backsliding. However, discourage your friend from thinking that all women or men are evil or fickle. Not everyone is evil when just one person hurts you. In the absence of being loved and needed by the ex, your friend may seek it in another, ill-advised relationship.. This is a terrible idea for the same reason that offering your friend too many distractions is a terrible idea—distraction versus dealing. Try to dissuade the person from jumping into another relationship if it looks that way, but remember to approach it the same way you approached the person trying to contact the ex. In other words, don’t get so invested that you’ll be upset if the person does it anyway, and don’t forbid it so harshly that you tempt them to do it to spite you.",
      "Immediately after a breakup—regardless of whether the relationship was six months or six years—your friend is likely to feel confused in addition to sadness. Your friend will likely want to start talking through this confusion almost immediately, and genuinely listening is one of the first and most meaningful steps you can take to show you care. No matter what reason someone gives us for breaking up, we’re always left with questions—“What could I have done differently?” or “Can I still fix this?” It’s perfectly logical for people to be confused about being rejected, especially if they don’t see the rejection coming. It’s always easier to maintain a friend through the good times, so it’s natural for hard times such as breakups to feel straining and frustrating on a friendship. Constantly remind yourself that it’s your job as a friend to be empathetic and involved even if it means listening to the same questions or stories repeatedly as your friend processes the new source of grief. Having patience through the process begins immediately and lasts the entire time. If it helps you, remind yourself of a similar time the friend helped you either through a breakup or maybe the loss of a job. Think objectively about how patient the friend was with you during your more difficult moments. Obviously, your friend doesn’t want to feel as though he or she is talking to a wall, so make sure you engage with the stories and questions raised to help make the person feel understood. During your responses, try to avoid empty cliches and platitudes about breakups, though. The last thing your friend wants to hear is that there are other fish in the sea because it invalidates his or her current emotional state.  In general, you should say things that both reassure your friend and acknowledge that his or her feelings are valid. Avoid telling the friend how to feel such as telling them to stay positive, and avoid immediately giving advice unless you are asked for it.  For example, instead of telling a friend to try to be more positive, acknowledge that the situation isn’t fair.  Now is not the time to give your friend advice. Just repeat back what they say to you to show them that you're listening. Validate their feelings by assuring them that it is okay to feel the way that they do. While you may feel tempted to compare your friend’s situation to a previous breakup of your own, you should avoid doing so in the immediate aftermath of the breakup. We may see this as relating to the person, but you may accidentally cross the line in the eyes of your grieving friend, making it seem like you’re stealing their thunder or making the situation about you. Give the friend time to make it about him or her. It’s pretty common for someone who has just been rejected to deny the finality of the situation. Your friend may be tempted in the early stages to reach out to the ex in ways that you know aren’t going to help. While you should discourage this course of action when the friend asks, don’t allow yourself to get too involved in the outcome.  Your friend has likely made up his or her mind to contact the person by the time the topic comes up, so you cannot allow yourself to get frustrated if the person doesn’t follow your advice.  A breakup awakens an irrational part of all of us. Forbidding your friend from contacting the ex is like a parent forbidding a teenager from doing something. Your friend may do it just to spite the voice of reason. The emotional effects of a breakup represent a grieving process. It’s not only natural for people to grieve, but it’s also necessary if the person wants to move on in a healthy manner. You may be tempted to immediately begin getting your friend out of the house to bombard the person with distractions from the pain and sadness, but you must allow your friend to grieve instead of constantly making him or her ignore or forget the breakup. Due to this, only use distractions sparingly and within reason.  While taking the friend out shopping or to a baseball game occasionally is a good break from the stress of the grieving process, attempting to subject the person constantly to outside stimuli will only prolong the process or possibly even lead the person to repress the emotions he or she needs to work through.  Don't try to set your friend up on a date or push them out into the dating pool. Finding a new partner right away may not be the answer for them."

      "If you develop back pain that won't go away after a few days, then schedule an appointment with your family physician. Your doctor will examine your back (spine) and ask questions about your family history, diet, and lifestyle, and maybe even take X-rays or send you for a blood test (to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection). However, your family doctor is not a musculoskeletal or spinal specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.  Other types of healthcare professionals who could help diagnose and treat mechanical back pain include osteopaths, chiropractors, physiotherapists, and massage therapists.  Prior to any acupressure treatments, your family doctor may recommend anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin to help you cope with your back pain. Mechanical low back pain is not considered a serious medical condition, although it can be quite painful and debilitating. Typical causes include spinal joint sprains, spinal nerve irritation, muscle strains and spinal disc degeneration. However, medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of back pain such as infection (osteomyelitis), cancer, osteoporosis, fracture, herniated disc, kidney disease or rheumatoid arthritis. X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your back pain. Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis, especially the cause (if possible), and provide you with various treatment options for your condition. Acupressure is only appropriate for mechanical back pain and not for more serious causes such as cancer, which would likely require chemotherapy, radiation and/or surgery. Pain from mechanical back pain can be severe, but it doesn't involve high fevers, rapid weight loss, bladder/bowel problems or loss of leg function, which are all signs of something more serious. If you feel overwhelmed learning about acupressure points and techniques, and uncomfortable treating yourself (or asking a friend for help) then use the internet to find nearby practitioners of TCM (they aren't all Asian) or allied professionals who have the appropriate training. This approach will cost you more money, of course, but you'll be in more capable and confident hands.  Many acupuncturists practice acupressure and vice versa. The number of acupressure treatments needed to be effective for back pain (or other conditions) is not well established, but starting out at 3x per week (every other day) for 2 weeks is reasonable to gauge progress.",
      "Stimulating the acupressure point between your big toe and second toe is best done while laying down supine, which is sometimes called the \"sleeping\" position by practitioners of TCM. For best results, press down on the top of the foot in the webbing between the first two toes and hold firmly for at least 30 seconds, then release gradually. Do both feet after a short rest between the two. Soaking your feet in an ice bath post-treatment will help prevent any bruising or foot soreness. There is another beneficial acupressure point on the bottom of your foot, a little closer to your toes than your heel. To start, clean your feet thoroughly and sit on a stable chair. Then massage the bottom of your foot for a few minutes before locating the pressure point. For best results, press down with your thumb and hold firmly for at least 30 seconds, then release gradually. Do both feet after a short rest between the two.  If you have especially ticklish feet, then use some peppermint lotion on them, which will cause a tingling sensation and make them less sensitive to touch. Massaging and putting pressure on the feet and parts of the lower legs is not appropriate for women who are pregnant as it may induce uterine contractions. The relevant pressure points behind the knees are situated directly below the center of the knee joint (point B-54) and also a few inches lateral to the knee joint within the lateral gastrocnemius or calf muscle (point B-53). For best results, press down with your thumb and hold firmly for at least 30 seconds, then release gradually. Do the points behind both knees consecutively.  Stimulating the B-54 and B-53 points behind both knees can help relieve stiffness in the back as well as pain in the hips, legs (from sciatica) and knees. The points behind the knee are sometimes referred to as the Commanding Middle by practitioners of TCM.",
      "One of the ways that acupuncture and acupressure work is that they cause certain compounds such as endorphins (the body's natural pain killers) and serotonin (the bodies feel-good chemical) to be released into the bloodstream. Therefore, pressing safely on certain spots hard enough to elicit achy pain, such as the fleshy point between the thumb and forefinger (called LI-4), can be effective for treating pain all over the body, not just the back.  Creating pain temporarily to treat pain due to an injury may seem strange, but that's one of the ways that acupressure and acupuncture work. While laying down on a sofa or bed, apply pressure on this point for at least 10 seconds and release it for another 5 seconds. Repeat at least 3x and wait to see how it impacts your back pain. This acupressure point is on the anterior part of your lower arm, about 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) below (distal to) where your elbow joint flexes. This point is within the brachioradialis muscle and often referred to as the LU-6 point. Sit up in a comfortable position and raise your arm to find the spot (typically 4 finger widths from your elbow). Start with the side of the body that hurts more and press the point for about 30 seconds, 3-4x for 5-10 minutes for best results. Acupressure points may be tender when you first press on them, but the feeling will likely diminish the more times you use them. Always try to press and activate acupressure points on both sides of your body, especially if they're easy to get at like the ones in the hands and elbows. It may not be obvious which side of your back is injured, so always stimulate acupressure points bilaterally if possible. As you first apply firm pressure to the hands and elbows, you will likely feel a slight achiness or even burning sensation. This often indicates you're pressing on the right spot and it will disappear as you continue to put pressure on it. Immediately after any acupressure treatment, you should apply ice (wrapped in a thin towel) to the thinner muscles of the arm for about 10 minutes, which will help prevent any bruising or unnecessary tenderness. In addition to ice, frozen gel packs are effective for inflammation and pain control too.",
      "Regardless of where you perceive your back pain, certain pressure points along the spine (and throughout the body) have been discovered over the centuries as areas that can alleviate pain, especially if it's mechanical in nature. The low back pressure points are situated just a few inches laterally to the 3rd lumbar spinal vertebrae (just above the level of your hip bones) within the paraspinal muscles and are referred to as points B-23 and B-47. Stimulating the B-23 and B-47 points on both sides of the spine can help relieve achy low back pain, pinched nerves, and sciatica (which includes shooting leg pain).  For best results, reach around your low back, press down on these points with your thumb and hold firmly for a couple of minutes, then release gradually. If you lack the flexibility or strength, then ask a friend after showing them a diagram of the points on your cell phone or another portable internet device. Alternatively, you could lay on your back and roll a tennis ball around the area for a few minutes. In TCM, these low back pressure points are also known as the Sea of Vitality. A little further down the backside are the pressure points of the hip region, often referred to as the B-48 points. These points are located a few inches lateral to the sacrum (tail bone) and superficially right over the sacroiliac joint (demarcated by the dimples above your butt muscles). For best results, press down and inward gradually with your thumb, towards the center of your pelvis, and hold firmly for a couple of minutes, then release gradually.  Stimulating B-48 points on both sides of the sacrum can help relieve sciatica, as well as low back, pelvic and hip pain. Again, if you lack the flexibility or strength, recruit a friend or grab a tennis ball. Slightly below and lateral to the B-48 points, lay the G-30 acupressure points. The G-30 points are situated in the more fleshy part of the buttocks, specifically in the piriformis muscles, which lay beneath the larger gluteus maximus muscles. For best results, press down and inward gradually with your thumb, towards the center of your buttocks, and hold firmly for a couple of minutes, then release gradually. The sciatic nerve is the thickest nerve in the body and runs down each leg through the buttocks region. Be careful not to irritate the sciatic nerves when putting pressure on those muscles. Immediately after any acupressure treatment, you should apply ice (wrapped in a thin towel) to the thicker muscles of the back/hips for about 15 minutes, which will help prevent any bruising or unnecessary tenderness. Putting ice directly on the skin runs the risk of frostbite and skin discoloration."

      "If you have a home filtration system, your water may not need to be dechlorinated. If not, you'll need to dechlorinate your tap water before introducing your fish to the water. The process is fairly simple, and there are two main methods of dechlorinating your water.  You can dechlorinate your water naturally by leaving it out in an opened container for several days. Over time the chlorine will evaporate out of the container, leaving only the now-dechlorinated water. You can dechlorinate water quickly and easily by adding a few drops of dechlorination solution from your local pet store. Follow the instructions on the label to ensure that your water levels are safe for fish. A freshwater tank is somewhat easier to refill than a marine aquarium. You won't need to do much to the water, other than dechlorinating it and ensuring that it's the right temperature (if your aquatic organisms require a specific temperature range).  Once you've dechlorinated enough water, you can simply pour it into the clean tank. If your fish require a specific temperature range, you'll need to monitor the temperature of the clean water before adding your fish. A saltwater tank can be a bit more work than a freshwater tank, but with a little patience it's easily manageable. The biggest difference between saltwater and freshwater aquariums is the need to salinate the water before adding it to the tank.  Mix a new batch of saltwater by combining your preferred commercial salt mix and the right amount of dechlorinated tap water. The specific gravity of your saltwater should measure 1.025. Pour the prepared saltwater into the tank and fill it to your desired level. Be careful not to disturb any plants or live rocks at the bottom of the tank. If your aquatic organisms require a specific temperature range you'll need to make sure the water is an acceptable temperature before reintroducing your fish. Once your tank is refilled and the temperature is correct (if relevant), you're ready to reintroduce your aquatic organisms. You can either use nets to scoop them out of their secondary container and into the clean tank, or you can carefully and gently pour them with the water from their container into the tank.  Make sure the filter and heater (if relevant) are working and have prepared the water before you reintroduce your aquatic organisms. Scooping and transferring them may be less stressful for the fish than pouring them back in.",
      "If you used a gravel cleaner to drain the tank, your gravel should be clean enough to skip this step. However, if you used a siphon hose, you'll want to clean the gravel to remove debris like leftover food and organic waste.  Collect the gravel in a colander. Make sure you only use this colander for cleaning your tank, as it will be too dirty to use for preparing food with. Rinse the gravel under clean, running tap water. You can use warm water but you should avoid using very hot water, as this will kill the healthy bacteria your fish rely on. Do not use soap or chemicals to clean the gravel, as these will also destroy the healthy bacteria that have colonized your tank. The filter in your tank traps a lot of organic debris, including leftover food and waste product. It's important to clean this equipment, but you need to do so carefully in order to avoid disrupting the bacterial colonies your fish depend on.  If you use disposable filter media, simply discard the old cartridge and replace it with a new one. If you use permanent filter media, you'll need to rinse your filter media under clean, running tap water. You can use cool or warm water but you should avoid hot water, as this can damage the healthy bacteria inside the filter. Rinse any objects from the aquarium, such as toys and submerged artifacts, under clean, running tap water and set them aside. If you want to thoroughly clean the tank, you'll need to at least wipe down the walls inside of it. Built-up algae and other debris may need to be scraped off; otherwise, you should be able to use a sponge or special wipe to clean the glass.  You can use an old credit card or ID card to scrape off algae that's stuck to the walls. Or, if you prefer, you can purchase a special tank scraper from a pet store to complete this task. Use clean paper towels or specialized cleaning wipes to scrub the inside of the tank. Do not use commercial cleaning products, as these will leave residual chemicals that can harm or even kill your aquatic organisms. Once you're finished cleaning the tank you can begin replacing the objects back into it. Set up the gravel, then arrange your filter and any artificial plants or toys in the substrate. Plug the filter and heater back in and make sure the water is habitable before reintroducing your aquatic organisms.",
      "You'll need to remove your fish and any other aquatic organisms before you can drain the water out of an aquarium. This requires great care, though, as fish tend to get frightened by this process and may become tangled in the nets.  Choose the correct net size so that your largest fish will fit inside. Even if the nets are large enough, you'll still need to exercise caution so the fish don't get injured during the transfer. Use two fish nets to catch your fish within the tank. Hold one net steady and use the other to \"herd\" your fish into the stable net one at a time. Transfer the fish to a second tank large enough to hold them all. If you're having a hard time catching your fish, you can try draining off a little bit of the water. Working in a shallower tank will make it easier to herd and catch the fish. Once the fish have been removed from the tank you'll want to disconnect any power sources from the tank. Whether it's a filter, heater, or just an overhead light, you do not want any active electricity going to your tank when you start to empty the water.  A plugged-in electricity source could cause electrocution if it gets wet. This can cause serious injuries which may even be fatal. Once you've unplugged each device you can move it out of the aquarium so that it is not in the way. Taking everything out of the tank before you drain the water will make it much easier to complete the draining process. These objects will need to get rinsed, so it may be best to do this near a sink if at all possible.  Take out any artificial plants and decorations (like toys or sunken objects) out of the aquarium. Leave them in the sink to be cleaned. Doing this before you drain the water will allow any stirred-up debris to settle before you begin emptying the tank. Whether you're new to aquarium maintenance or have been doing it for years, there's always a chance that something might spill. It's generally a good idea to lay down protective materials whenever you drain the tank or change the water to ensure that nothing in your home gets damaged.  Arrange a few old towels on the floor around your aquarium. If you're really worried about spilling you can lay down tarps or mats underneath the towels for extra protection. There are two main methods of emptying an aquarium. The first is to siphon the water out using a hose. The second is to drain the water using a gravel cleaner that simultaneously drains water, such as The Python or Aqueon.  If siphoning off the water with a hose, dip one end into the tank and begin filling the other end with water from a tap. Then stop filling the tap end and let it drain out; once water starts draining it will continue to draw water out of the tank. If using a gravel cleaner, activate the device and submerge the intake end all the way down into the gravel. You'll need to lift and reposition the device periodically as it drains, but it can be much easier and less messy than using a siphon hose."

      "You will need to pursue a higher education to become a radiologic technologist, so you will have to start here if you do not have this degree already. If you're still in high school and know you want to be a radiologic technologist, then you can try to take courses that can help you succeed in the field. Here are some courses you can focus on in high school:  Anatomy Biology Chemistry Mathematics Physics You can get the education you need in three ways: through a bachelor's degree, an associate degree, or a certificate program. You may find a B.A. program that offers a major in Radiologic Technology, though the most common path for radiologic technologists is getting an associate degree from an accredited community college or a private (for-profit) institution. The certificate program typically lasts 21-24 months and is perfect for individuals who already have experience in radiology technology. Whatever higher educational path you take, you will study the following subjects:  Anatomy and physiology Patient care and management Equipment operation Radiographic procedures Radiation protection Image production Clinical practice Medical terminology While you're getting your education, you will most likely have to get some hands-on training to learn the ropes of the career. Just make sure to take a program that is certified by The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT). You may have to take coding and medical office courses as well as to learn how to work with actual patients. Once you get your training, here are some of the things you will learn to do:  Operate x-ray equipment. Organize, process and analyze medical images. Acquire and calculate accurate mathematical measurements. Perform quality control. Specializing in a specific field of radiologic technology will give you a leg up in interviews and will make you a desirable candidate. You can specialize during your training or after you've gone on the job. Specialization requires more training and the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) certification in your field. Here are some fields that you can specialize in:  Mammography Computer tomography (CT) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Cellular imaging Medical sonography Medical imaging Radiography To become a certified technologist, a student may be required to successfully pass the exams, as well as meet the Technical Standards and Essential Functions (TSEF). The exam may be given by your individual state or by the AART. It tests the following skills:  Observation skills. The student must demonstrate the ability to assess and comprehend the diagnosis. Communication skills. The student must learn verbal, non-verbal and written formats. Motor skills. The student must execute basic movements to lift and move immobile patients. Intellectual skills. The student must be able to make decisions, interpret, collect and integrate information. Most states require individuals to secure a license along with their certification. You should look into the requirements of your state, since they differ; some states simply use the ARRT exams for licensing, but others may require additional work to be done. Contact your state's health board for more information on what you need to do to become a radiology technician in your state.",
      "If you want to maintain your ARRT certified status, then you'll need to get 24 hours of continuing education every two years. This will help you brush up on your skills, learn new techniques, and to stay current in your field. As you become more experienced in your career, you may be asked to train or even to manage entry-level technologists. Make sure you know how to educate and manage others in a professional and helpful manner. Your job will require you to work closely with patients, many of whom will be under incredible stress or in extreme pain. They will need you to calm them down and to help them relax as you do your job. As you grow in your career, you will need to master small talk as well as the ability to make patients feel as calm and comfortable as possible. They will undoubtedly be nervous and they may ask you what you see on the machines. However, you cannot diagnose patients yourself or tell them what you see; you may notice a large tumor, but you must not show distress and keep telling the patients that only the doctors can diagnose the problems and that your job is just to operate the machine. You will need both physical and mental stamina to succeed at your job. Though the average work week for a radiology technician is 40 hours a week, your job may require you to work evenings, weekends, or to take on other on-call work, especially when you're starting out. You will need to stay physically strong because you may have to lift and move patients, and you will have to stay mentally tough because the job can get a bit repetitive and can also be emotionally draining, as working with potentially sick patients may take a toll on you. Though the job can be a bit mentally and physically draining, at the end of the day, you should feel proud that you're helping patients diagnose their problems and to get on the road to recovery. Though the position of radiologic technologist has less opportunities for clinical advancement, if you do want to advance, then you can move into several other fields that can offer a change of pace and in some cases, a higher salary. Here are the most common fields that experienced radiology technicians can enter into:  Education Sales Consulting Industry",
      "Internships are great for getting training in a field. An internship will allow you to receive first-hand knowledge of the daily routines. This may also be more feasible if you're having a hard time finding full-time employment at first. Read the job description and posting thoroughly before completing an application. Make sure that you meet the necessary qualifications before you apply for the position. After getting hired, enjoy the employment benefit package. Go online to reputable websites such as the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) site to see what opportunities are out there.  Answer all questions with clear and precise information using buzz words. Buzz words are the words the human resources department will initially scan for when checking an application. If requested, submit all credentials such as a transcript, certification and references. Make a copy of paperwork for your file before submitting. The benefits packages may include: a pension plan, tuition reimbursement, paid vacation, holidays and sick days and insurance coverage. Professional organizations keep members informed of new techniques, procedures, legislative acts, new licensure requirements and updates on conferences and continuing education programs. These organizations will also help you network and meet other people in your field who could help you find future work. If you want to be the best radiologic technologist that you can be, then you can continue to develop the skills you need to excel at your job. Here are the some of the qualities that you should posses and improve:  Being detail-orientied. You have to follow the exact instructions you need to get the correct images that will help to diagnose and treat your patients. Science and mathematical skills. You must deepen your understanding of physiology, anatomy, and other sciences. Technical skills. You must have a deep understanding of how to operate the complex machinery at your disposal."

    ],

      "You have lots of flexibility when it comes to formatting an original oratory, but you should structure your speech around a concise thesis. A thesis is one sentence that clearly states your argument and provides a road map for the rest of your speech.  Your thesis should convey to your audience the speech's purpose and stance. Be clear and direct instead of including words like \"This speech is about\" before your thesis. If your topic is DIY education, your thesis could be, “Making do it yourself knowledge widely available is essential to contemporary society.” Your 3 points will provide evidence that supports your thesis, and you'll discuss them in detail in your speech's body. You'll state the thesis and main points in the introduction, expand and defend them in your speech's body, and summarize them in a conclusion. For your speech about DIY education, your main points could deal with the personal, practical, and economic benefits of DIY education. You'd use one section in your body to expand on each benefit. Write your speech as you would an academic paper. Everyone writes differently, and some people prefer to write the introduction first, the body second, and the conclusion last. However, organizing the body of your speech first can help you summarize your main points more concisely in your introduction and conclusion.  When you organize the body of your speech, don't spend too much or too little time on 1 or 2 points. Try to balance your time equally between your points, and make sure you're familiar with your time limit or permitted word count. For example, you could spend 1-2 paragraphs discussing the personal pride that comes with completing a DIY project on your own. You could then spend a couple of paragraphs discussing practical benefits, like being able to handle a medical emergency. Finally, you can talk about the money and resources one saves by completing a DIY project on their own. While you should include evidence in the body of your speech to support your points, you'll need to strike a balance between statistics, insight, and personal connection to the topic. Keep in mind that most speech competitions have limits on the number of quoted words you use, so be selective and only include the strongest available evidence. When you choose your citations, don't twist or misrepresent a source to fit your agenda. Don't forget to document your source both verbally when you deliver the speech and in the written script. Your verbal citations should be thorough enough that your audience could find them on their own for further research. You can typically use any manual style, like MLA, but you should check with your teacher or debate coach to verify which is best for your assignment. For example, cite a source by saying, \"According to a 2012 study by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, community education outside of the classroom provides medical students with more robust knowledge and better patient interaction skills.\" This quote does not contain unnecessary details that would disrupt the flow of the speech, but it does clearly display the source. Including a perspective that opposes your argument is a great way to strengthen your case. Include a paragraph that summarizes an opposing statement, then include evidence to the contrary to prove that your argument is more valid. You could include, for instance, a source that calls DIY a form of dilettantism or dabbling. Then you could refute this argument as dismissive and short-sighted by citing examples of individuals who have cultivated in-depth DIY knowledge on a variety of subjects. The introduction should grab the audience's attention, state the problem your thesis addresses, and lay down your solution's roadmap. The conclusion must be a strong, concise restatement of your thesis and main points.  Once you've organized the body of your speech, you'll have a better idea of how to structure the introduction and conclusion. In general, follow this structure: tell your audience what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them. Avoid clichés, such as, “According to Webster's dictionary, this is defined as…” Once you've written and revised your oratory, have other people critique its content and format. Have an English teacher or professor read it and give you feedback on the quality of your writing. Ask your peers to read it to gauge whether your topic and presentation style appeal to broad audiences. It's also a good idea to practice giving your speech in front of a small audience so you can get feedback on your delivery.",
      "An original oratory is typically a memorized speech. Start memorizing your speech as soon as you've drafted it. Don't wait until the last minute or your grade or competition performance will reflect your procrastination.  To memorize your speech, break it up into smaller sections. Work on memorizing a few sentences at a time, then a paragraph, then nail an entire section. Try rewriting 2 or 3 sentences and saying them out loud as you write. Writing, speaking, and reading at the same time will help your brain create more connections, helping you memorize your content. Generally, you'll have less than 10 minutes to deliver your original oratory. Use a stopwatch or your phone's clock to time yourself. Give yourself some wiggle room of at least 30-60 seconds, just in case you take a little longer to deliver your speech than in practice. Give yourself plenty of time to deliver your speech clearly so you don't have to speak so quickly that your audience can't understand you. Since your speech will be memorized, it's especially vital to use facial expressions and eye contact to connect with your audience. Practice your speech in the mirror to make sure your expressions are natural and project confidence. If you're nervous about making eye contact, look slightly above your audience to create the illusion that you're maintaining eye contact. Use gestures and movements to reinforce your most important points. However, don't use unnatural or repetitive gestures, like raising your hands in the same exact way every time. If you're not confident in your ability to mix up your gestures naturally, just keep your hands loosely folded or by your side.",
      "Make sure you're familiar with any applicable rules, whether you're participating in a competition debate or writing an oratory for a class. Know your maximum allotted time, which is generally under ten minutes, and make sure you're well acquainted with the judging or grading rubric.  Keep the parameters and guidelines in mind while choosing a topic, outlining, and writing the oratory. If you have any questions, ask your teacher or debate coach for clarity. that gets you excited. You can choose almost any topic for your original oratory. This flexibility can be overwhelming, but you should see it as an opportunity to share information about something that matters to you. Since you'll have to do lots of research, you should choose a topic that you find important and exciting.  Your topic should be culturally relevant and appeal to broad audiences, but shouldn't be cliche or overdone. If you're passionate about do it yourself (DIY) knowledge, for example, you could write an oratory about the value of widely available DIY education. An original oratory can inform your audience about a topic or persuade them to accept your argument. When you start planning your speech, decide if you'd rather share information with your audience or convince them of something.  For instance, you might decide that you want to persuade your audience that DIY education has personal, societal, and economical benefits. Or, perhaps you want to inform your audience about the destruction of the wetlands and extinction of plant and animal species in wetlands across the globe. Whether your intent is to inform or persuade, you'll need to cultivate thorough knowledge on your topic and support your oratory with evidence. Think of your original oratory as a school research paper.  You can begin with broad search terms (like “destruction of wetlands”) and narrow them down (such as “beaver population declined from 1980-2018”) as you hone your focus. Choose sources such as reputable periodicals, encyclopedias, authoritative books, and scientific journals."

      "If there is poison on her coat, when the cat grooms herself she will swallow it and risk further toxicity. If the contaminant is a powder, brush it off. If it is sticky, such as tar or oil, you may need to use a specialist hand-cleansing product such as Swarfega Hand Cleaner (as used by motor mechanics) worked into the fur. Bathe the cat in lukewarm water for 10 minutes to remove all residue, and then rinse well with water. As a last resort, you may wish to cut off the worst affected hair with scissors or clippers. Better safe than sorry! Many poisons are harmful to liver, kidneys, or both. To reduce the risk of organ damage from poison already absorbed, ensure the cat drinks freely. If she will not drink spontaneously, then syringe water into her mouth. Slowly dribble it in one ml at a time and be sure to let her swallow. An average cat requires 250 ml of water a day, so don’t be afraid to refill that dosing syringe lots of times! Include all labels, packaging and bottles, so that all information can be relayed to a veterinarian or a Pet Poison Control Hotline. Your efforts may help future cat owners (and cats!) in similar predicaments. Your cat needs to be checked out by a vet to make sure that it's okay. The vet can make sure that you got all of the poison, and that there are no long-term issues to be concerned about.",
      "This will help you decide on whether it is correct or inappropriate to make the cat vomit. If you have access to the packaging make a note of the following information: trade name, active ingredient(s), and strength. In addition, try to estimate how much the cat has consumed. (Was it a new box? How much is missing?)  Your first contacts should be your vet, the pet poison hotline, and the product manufacturer. If you have access to the internet, search the active ingredient. It is helpful to phrase the search like this:  Is [name of product] toxic to cats? Some products may be safe when ingested and if you find that out, you need go no further. If the substance is poisonous, the next step is to decide whether to make the cat vomit or not. Do not give your kitty any food, water, milk, salt, oil or any other home remedy unless you know what poison the cat ingested and the specific medication or first aid. Giving any of these without any consultation or instruction from a veterinarian or a Pet Poison Helpline may worsen the condition of your cat. The vet or the helpline will have more knowledge and skill in determining what to do or what to give your poisoned cat. Do not make your cat do anything without instruction from a vet or a pet poison helpline. Some poisons (particularly corrosive acids) can do more harm if vomiting is induced. Only induce emesis (sickness) if:  The poison was eaten within the past two hours. If it was eaten more than two hours ago, it has already been absorbed, so vomiting is useless. The cat is conscious and able to swallow. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious, semi-conscious, or seizing/mentally altered cat. The poison is NOT an acid, strong alkali or petroleum product. You're 100% certain you know the poison was ingested. Acids, alkalis and petroleum products cause caustic burns. Irrespective of when they were consumed, do not induce vomiting because they will likely damage the gullet, throat and mouth on the way back up.  Strong acids and alkalis are found in household rust removers, glass etching fluids, and cleaning products such as bleach. Petroleum products include lighter fluid, gasoline and kerosene. As previously mentioned you should not make the cat vomit, instead encourage her to drink full-fat milk or eat a raw egg. If she will not drink freely, then use the child’s dosing syringe to drip feed up to 100 ml of milk into her mouth. This will help dilute the acid or alkali, and neutralize it. A raw egg has a similar action. t if instructed to. You will need a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide (do NOT use the more concentrated hydrogen peroxide supplied with some hair perms or dyes) and a teaspoon or child’s dosing syringe.You will find it easier to syringe peroxide, rather than spoon it into her mouth. Here's what you should know:  The dose of 3% hydrogen peroxide is 5 ml (one teaspoon) per 5 lb body weight, by mouth. An average cat weighs around 10 lb, so you will need about 10 ml (two teaspoons worth.) Repeat this every ten minutes, for a maximum of three doses.  To dose the cat, hold her securely and gently insert the syringe into the cat’s mouth, behind the upper fangs. Depress the plunger, dribbling about of ml at a time onto the cat’s tongue. Give her time to swallow each time and never shoot the full amount in quickly since you may flood her mouth and then she will inhale the peroxide into her lungs. After vomiting, your aim is now to reduce the absorption of poison that has passed further down into the intestine. For this you need activated charcoal. The dose is 1 gram of dry powder for every 1 lb body weight of the cat. An average sized cat will require around 10 grams. Dissolve the powder in the smallest volume of water possible, to form a thick slurry, and syringe it into the cat’s mouth. Repeat this dose every 2 to 3 hours, for 4 doses.",
      "A cat may be suffering from poisoning if any of the following general symptoms are observed:  Difficulty in breathing Blue tongue and gums Panting Vomiting and/or diarrhea Gastric irritation Coughing and sneezing Depression Salivation Seizures, tremors or involuntary muscle twitching Weakness and potentially unconsciousness Dilated pupils Frequent urination Dark urine Shivering When poisoning is suspected and your cat is lying down, unconscious or weak, immediately remove your cat from the area, and transfer it to a well-ventilated and well-lit place.  Wear long sleeves and/or gloves to protect yourself from the poison. Sick and wounded cats are likely to bite and scratch because they are upset and afraid. When a cat feels unwell, or is anxious, her first instinct is to hide. If the cat has been poisoned you will need to monitor her symptoms and so it is not appropriate to let her hole up somewhere. In a gentle but firm manner, pick the cat up and take her to a safe room.  The kitchen or bathroom is ideal, since you will need access to water. If the poison is within the area, cautiously remove it away from reach of any pets or humans. An experienced vet or helpline can help you calm down and will be able to give you clear instructions on what to do or what antidote to give to your poisoned cat. Always remember that the chances of your cat surviving will be higher if you immediately call the vet. This should be the very first thing to do after stabilizing your cat.  You can also call the Pet Poison Helpline (800-213-6680) or the ASPCA Poison Control Center (1-888-426-4435). Pet poison hotlines are not funded by the government like human poison hotlines are, so they usually charge a fee to help pay for the service."

      "After the aspect ratio, a single letter will be listed that denotes how the tire was constructed. “R” means radial construction, “B” stands for belted bias, and “D” means diagonal bias construction. Choose a spare or new tire with the same casing and construction as the rest. After the letter, there will be a 2-digit number. This number gives the measurement, in inches, of the rim diameter, which is essential to know if you're getting new rims or wheels. For instance, if the number is 17, your rims are 17 inches (43.2 cm) in diameter. The last combination of letters and numbers is called the service description. The load index refers to the load-carrying capabilities of a properly-inflated tire, while the speed rating tells you the maximum speed the tire can handle.  The load index number corresponds with a load index chart, and does not tell you the weight in pounds. For instance, a load index of 98 can carry 1,653 pounds.  Speed ratings are lettered A–Z and correspond to a speed rating chart. For example, the letter H indicates a maximum speed of 130 mph.",
      "Tires are manufactured with the tire size printed on the sidewall. The sidewall is the outer wall of the tire, rather than the tread that contacts the road. The size should be printed underneath the tire manufacturer name, just above the rim of the tire. For instance, the series may look like this: P 225 / 50 R 17 98 H On some tires, the series of numbers begins with a letter. “P” stands for “P-metric” and denotes a passenger vehicle. “LT” stands for light truck, “T” means temporary spare, and “C” stands for commercial. If you're purchasing a spare or new tire, you'll need to choose the same service type as the rest of the tires. The 3-digit number before the slash denotes the tire width, which is measured from sidewall to sidewall and corresponds to the tread that contacts the road. The measurement is given in millimeters, and all 4 tires must have the same width. For instance, if the first number is 225, the tire tread is 225 mm wide. The numbers after the slash indicate the aspect ratio, which compares the tire's section height with the tire's section width. If you're replacing only 1 tire, make sure it has the same aspect ratio as the others. For example, if there is a “50” after the slash it means the tire's section height is 50% of the tire's section width."

      "Choose a game from the “Custom Game” list. It should say DotA, then the version, and the various game modes.  The most common game modes include:  \"-ap,\" which lets you choose any hero; \"-em,\" which makes the game easier; \"-ar,\" which gives each player a random hero.   If you’re just beginning, you may want to try the random hero choice for a few games so you can familiarize yourself with several of the characters. If you already have a good knowledge of one hero, you’re probably better off choosing that hero. If it is your first game, however, choose an easy hero to play, such as Skeleton King, who has the \"Reincarnation\" ability which will bring him back to life when killed. To choose a hero, click on one of the buildings you see, or ones in the opposite corner of the map, and you will see a list of all the heroes you can choose from. Select one of these or type \"–random\" to get a random hero. Start by finding what type of hero you have: Strength, Intelligence, or Agility. Generally, you can tell what kind of hero you have by looking at which stat is the highest.  You can view the stats by clicking your hero and looking to the right of the unit portrait. Based on this, look through the shops, and buy items that will boost these skills. In the beginning, you should stick to the Female Human's shop or the shop nearest to the fountain, which contains the \"Boots of Speed\" item. The Boots item is absolutely essential to success, as it allows your character to move around more quickly; when in trouble this is exactly what you need. If you’re not very good, you may especially want to stock up on defensive items like Bracers. Some items when combined together make more powerful items. These combinations are called recipes. Later in the game you will start buying recipes, which are found at the other shops. To get these items, you must buy all the items listed in the description. If the recipe does not cost gold, it means that you just need to accumulate the items in the description, and you don't need to buy the recipe itself. A recipe's power is dictated by the shop it is found in. Going from weakest to strongest, these shops are: the Human Peasant shop, Orc Peon shop, Night Elf Wisp shop, and Undead Acolyte shop. As you progress you will also need to buy items that are more designed for your hero. The best way to find what these items are is to ask other players in the game. However, many players may prove to be of very little help, and might harass you until you get fed up and leave the game. The best idea is to simply ignore such people and persevere until you do not require the help of other players. Click the symbol of the Red Cross in your character's menu, look at your skills, and choose the one you think is most useful. A lane is the path where the computer controlled monsters, or creeps, will run down and attack all enemies in their path. Try to get into a lane with an ally and follow their example. You will get gold for each creep you kill, and you will automatically get gold over time. (You will get a lot more gold over time in Easy Mode than non-easy mode.) To maximize your gold, don't attack creeps constantly, watch their health gauges carefully and time the last hit to get gold.  When fighting in a lane, the goal is to stay and get experience as much as possible without having to go back to your base and heal. You gain experience points by being in the vicinity of a kill, so you can stand back behind your friendly creeps and then attack the enemy creeps, while your creeps are taking all of the damage. If you end up alone in a lane, don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are inexperienced and the opponents in your lane are just too good for you, explain to your teammates that you are new, and they will probably help you. You may be able to get somebody to switch lanes with you if your lane is being pushed, or somebody may team up with you in your lane. The main problem for beginners in DotA is that they are a bit confused about what to do during team battle. There are many playing styles but these are the the most important and commonly known. Other styles will come with the gaming experience.   Ganker. These types of heroes usually have with high HP (hit points) and powerful area spells. They can take a lot of hits and do a lot of damage too. A hero like Axe is one of them.  Carry. These types of heroes are supposed to get killed for the team. They are usually active from the mid game to the end. These heroes have a lot of damaging spells and attacks. Heroes like Phantom Lancer are Carries.  Supportive. These types of heroes are very important in a game. They support the team-mate (especially the Carry) to get kills and not to get killed. Dazzle is an example of a Supportive hero.  Babysitter. This type of playing style is usually required when the Carry is having trouble getting kills. Hence, a Babysitter's duty is to help the Carry get kills until he is able to farm by him. Use your skills on heroes to weaken them, and then call for a gank, or gang kill, where your teammate(s) come from behind the enemy hero and you both attack, hopefully killing the enemy. When an enemy is killed, you pick up their gold. The towers in the lanes are very powerful; don't mess with your opponent’s towers. Instead, let your creeps damage them little by little. On the other hand, if your hero is weakened, you may be able to stay alive by staying very close to your tower.  Move around a bit so that you can always stay behind the tower. As enemies approach, they’ll have to deal with the tower instead of you. If, however, 3 or more heroes or creeps are ganging your tower, move away. You may just need to go back to home base. Once you have a good amount of money from killing creeps/heroes, ask your teammates what they recommend you buy. Then go back to your base and buy that item/recipe. The right choice of items for your hero can make the difference between life and death, so don’t just buy things randomly. Different conditions call for different items. During a group fight, if your team mates are getting killed by a single hero who seems impossible to kill, you might decide to make \"Orchid\" or \"Cyclone\" or \"Hex.\" Then you'll be able to buy some time to gather all your friends around the enemy hero and tank him or her. Towards the end of the game, you’ll want to earn as much experience (from kills) as possible, so you should try to kill heroes. Of course, you should still kill creeps if you are behind everyone in levels, and if you need money. Remember, DotA is a team game—help your team in any way you can. The ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the enemy’s base and their main building (The Frozen Throne or the Tree of Life). As you destroy the enemy’s barracks, your creeps get stronger, so this should also be a priority."

      "Before you start caring for a pregnant cat, you'll want to make sure the cat is pregnant. While people can take simple urine or blood tests at home to confirm pregnancy, this option doesn't exist for cats. However, physical signs do emerge in the earliest stages of pregnancy that can clue you in that your cat may be carrying kittens. The full gestation period of a cat is around 60-70 days, so the process will move along quickly.  By the third week the cat's nipples will become enlarged and pink. This is referred to as \"pinking up.\" By the fourth week, the cat will begin to gain weight, making the pregnancy visible. By around the fourth week, your vet should be able to help confirm a pregnancy. An experienced vet can feel around the cat's stomach and feel the kittens. They could also do an ultrasound to detect heartbeats. There will also be noticeable behavior changes, particularly in the final weeks. They may appear uncomfortable due to their growing abdomen and meow to seek more attention or affection. As their pregnancy moves along, they'll eat more and spend even more time than usual sleeping. You'll need to make sure your cat is getting proper nutrition for her own health, but also the growing young inside of her. By the start of the sixth week, you should be offering at least 25% more food. Also, make sure the diet is high in protein and calcium are essential to both the kittens and the mother's ability to lactate.  Introduce a diet designed for kittens to your pregnant cat. These diets are rich in protein and calcium that the cat will need during this time. You should continue to feed them kitten food during their entire pregnancy and after delivery. You will not need any special vitamin or mineral mixes, as long as you are feeding them a high quality diet of kitten food. Buy a common and trusted brand to make sure it's up standards. Always make sure fresh water is available. This is just as important as any food. Although a healthy cat will rarely have problems introduced by pregnancy, it's important to make sure your cat is healthy enough for the rigors or pregnancy and birthing. Have your cat checked for routine parasites and make sure common vaccinations are up to date. Other more acute problems to look for include:  Watch with concern if your pregnant cat loses interest in food. This can be an indication of a bigger problem and also cut off necessary nutrients. In some cases a cat may lose interest in food right before giving birth, but it should not last long. If your cat is acting distressed and licking her vulva area, this may an indication of a problem. This could mean there is an irritation or a problem the cat is sensing. You should have the cat examined by a vet. Look out for any abnormal, bad-smelling vaginal discharge. This can happen during labor or during pregnancy, and in all cases should be followed up by a vet. If you notice blood in your cat's urine, or they're squatting with no urine coming out, this can be a sign of uterine infection. This can be painful for your cat and affect the kittens if left untreated. If you have been tracking your cat's pregnancy since the beginning, you will have a rough approximation of when the due date is looming. However, if you aren't sure of the timeline, there are other means to recognize that labor may be near. Some of the signs include:  Your cat is actively looking for secluded areas for nesting. Your cat is less active and losing appetite. A drop in body temperature. Frequent licking of belly and genital area. It is essential that your cat is comfortable and safe for the birthing process. This includes bringing them indoors so they aren't exposed to harsh elements, but also creating a safe and cozy nesting spot where they can give birth and nurse their kittens. If your cat has a current favorite bed or blankets it lays on, move them to a quiet and safe area away from busy traffic of the house. Create a nesting area. This can simply be a large cardboard box that is lined with her own bed or sheets, The mom will likely begin to situate herself in a nesting area a day or less before she is ready to give birth. If she chooses her own nesting spot outside of the one you created for her, just accommodate the spot that she chooses by making sure it's safe rather than trying to move her.",
      "Your cat will now need to care for her kittens. Nursing kittens will require that your cat has access to more food, sometimes as much as double, and continue wth a high protein/calcium diet. Continue to feed your cat a high protein kitten food and always provide access to clean water. The mother should use her body heat to keep the kittens warm. However, you'll also want to make sure her environment makes this as easy as possible. Keep warm blankets near her and the room temperature high.  If the mother is being inattentive to the kittens, you can provide a heating pad on low to help keep the babies warm. Make sure the kittens and mom remain in a calm place where she will not feel threatened. This can cause a danger to the kittens and the mom. Your cat still may have problems after the birthing process is done. If you notice vaginal bleeding, or a prolapsed uterus (a uterus pushed out through the vagina), you should consult your vet. Also look for:  Look out for atypical behavior, such as ignoring the kittens. She may reject the kittens, or if she feels in enough danger, she may even kill the litter. Keep an eye out for inflamed mammary glands. Infected glands will become enlarged, hot to the touch, and may even appear a different color. Watch for changes in appetite. If your cat is not getting enough nutrients this can endanger both her and the kittens. If an extended period goes by and your cat is unwilling to eat, take her to a vet.",
      "Giving birth is a very natural process for a cat and something that she is built to experience alone. Therefore, you won't need to directly intervene unless there are signs that the pregnancy is going awry. Learn the stages of birthing so you can better be equipped to know what is natural.  The first stage of labor lasts about 36 hours, and will typically be shorter if the cat has previously had kittens. During this period your cat will visit her nesting spot regularly but also have intermittent contractions with signs of strain. Late in this stage, panting and scratching at the nesting area may increase. The second stage will last anywhere from five to thirty minutes for each kitten. There will be stronger contractions and each kitten will be pushed out by active straining of the mom, usually head first. The mom will break the bag and chew the cord herself for each kitten and will require no additional assistance. The third and final stage will find the mom passing a placenta membranes and mass for each kitten. The mother cat will eat the placentas so as to hide the evidence that she gave birth. The entire process should happen within four to six hours. If it lasts longer than this, you should call a vet for help. Although most deliveries happen without any problem, you'll want to know what to watch for and how to act in case of a worst case scenario.  If a kitten is only partly out and the mother seems to be tired and given up on pushing, you can gently help the kitten ease out but you must be very gentle. If the mother does not bite through the cord, you can help by tying off the cord using a clean sewing thread about 3 centimeters from the kitten's body. If a mother cat does not clean a kitten you can do so by using a clean kitchen towel and gently wiping the kitten. Make sure to clear its mouth and nose of any liquid that might restrict breathing. There are complications that can happen during a pregnancy that should only be handled by a vet. If you notice any of these situations, you should immediately call a vet:  If the cat is straining for longer than 30 minutes without producing anything. There could be an obstruction preventing a natural birth, putting the mother and kittens in danger. If there is a period of an hour or more between the first kitten and subsequent births. If the cat suddenly appears weak and unable to continue with labor. The presence of excessive blood during birth without a kitten. Greenish afterbirth is common, but without a kitten can be a signal for a problem. Keep an eye out for kittens who cannot be dislodged using gentle force. A Caesarean Section may be needed in these cases and a vet should be consulted."

    ],
    "document": [
      "There are the obvious spots, like near fishermen or fishing boats, where bait, injured fish, and blood and guts are plentiful and may attract sharks. Other potentially dangerous areas include:  River mouths and channels. This is where food, dead animals, and fish that are flowing down-stream enter the ocean, making them great spots for sharks to hang out.  Areas where sewage enters the water. The sewage attracts fish, which will attract sharks.  Deep channels, near sandbars, or where the reef or sand drops off steeply. Sharks lurk in these areas to catch fish that wander out of the shallows.  Where large groups of shark prey hang out. If there are seals pupping nearby or a population of other marine animals in the area, sharks may be hunting nearby and could easily confuse you with prey. If sharks have recently been sighted, there should be warnings posted on the beach - heed them. If the beach is closed, come back another day. Sharks generally feed at dawn, dusk, and night, so stick to late morning or afternoon sessions. Most shark attacks occur because the shark confused a surfer with prey. Visibility is low in cloudy water, making it more likely a shark will confuse you with a seal and attack. Water can be especially murky following storms or heavy rainfall. Rain can also stir up baitfish and attract sharks. Some sharks, especially adult great whites, tend to avoid kelp forests. Again, it's highly unlikely you will ever see a shark, but some experts believe that some sharks migrate closer to land during October, possibly to give birth. So, if you're really anxious about having a run-in with a shark, maybe wait until November to break out the wetsuit.",
      "Sharks are attracted to thrashing--they equate those movements with wounded prey--and can sense fear, both of which can send them into attack mode. Try to keep your wits about you so you can make smart decisions and prepare to defend yourself. If the shark is nearby and hasn't attacked, move toward the shore as swiftly and quietly as you can, using smooth, rhythmic strokes.  Try to keep the shark in your sights at all times.  If you notice the shark is displaying aggressive behavior (erratic movements, a hunched back, or quick turns), move as quickly as possible to a rock, nearby kelp canopy, or shore. Get it between you body and the shark and use it as a shield, protecting your front and sides. The surfboard's buoyancy can prevent a shark from dragging you deep under the water, should it attack. If the shark does attack, don't play dead. Use your surfboard as a weapon. Try to avoid using your hands if possible, since you may injure them on the shark's teeth. Aim your blows at the shark's eyes, gills, or nose. Your life depends on swift medical attention. Scream for help, send a friend to get the lifeguard and call 911, do whatever it takes to make sure help is on the way as soon as possible.",
      "Instead of surfing alone, surf with a buddy or a group of people. Sharks target individuals and are less likely to approach a group. Surfing with a friend increases the chances of your survival, in the unlikely event a shark attack occurs. Most shark attack fatalities are due to not getting help fast enough. A friend who can get you out of the water and notify the lifeguard could save your life. Sharks can't see colors, but they can see contrast (like a black and white swimming suit).Shiny objects may catch the light and resemble fish scales. Remove all jewelry before entering the water and stick to wetsuits and swimsuits in solid, bland colors.  Yellow, orange, white, and flesh-colored suits should be avoided.  If you have a high-contrast tan (areas of your exposed skin are very dark, while other areas are very white), wear a suit that covers those white areas, so you appear uniform in color. If you get injured while surfing and start to bleed, get out of the water. A little blood in the water can attract sharks from up to 1/3 of a mile away. Some experts also recommend women take a break from surfing during menstruation. Though it is unlikely sharks associate the blood discharged during menstruation with feeding, the other fluids in the discharge may arouse a shark's curiosity."

You will be mixing everything in this bowl at the end. The chocolate won't be quite melted yet, but you still need to stir it. This will help it melt more evenly in the next few steps. Keep doing this until the chocolate mixture is smooth. There should be no lumps or clumps. Do not melt the chocolate for longer than 30 seconds at a time. Once it starts to melt, it will burn easily. If you heat it too long, it will scorch. This will help give the muddy buddies a hint of flavor. It will take about 10 to 15 minutes for them to cool. Once the cereal cools, it is ready to eat. If you notice any clumped together, gently break them apart using your fingers. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. For some extra color, mix in 1 cup (175 grams) of M&Ms, or a similar candy, just before serving. You can even use seasonal mixes for the holidays. For example, you can use red, white, and green M&Ms for Christmas.",
      "You will be spreading the finished muddy buddies across this at the end, so that they can cool. If you'd like to make a multi-colored mix, you will need a separate baking sheet per color. This will be enough to make one batch of colored muddy buddies. If you'd like to make multi-colored muddy buddies, you will need a separate bowl for each color. Each bowl will get 4 cups (400 grams) of Chex cereal. If you are using more than one color, heat the candy melts in separate bowls. Plan to work with one color at a time. Candy melts are essentially colored white chocolate. You can find them in the baking section of an arts and crafts store. This will be enough for one batch of colored muddy buddies. If you are making several different colors, you will need a separate bag for each color. Each bag will get 1/3 cup (40 grams) of powdered sugar. You are using minimal powdered sugar, because if you use too much, the colors won't show as well. Try to spread the cereal as evenly as possible. If you are making other colors, spread each color across as separate baking sheet. If you don't do this, the different colors may stick together and mix. The cereal may stick together because of how little powdered sugar you used. If this happens, simply break the cereal apart. If you made multiple colors, consider mixing them all together in one bowl. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.",

Keep microwaving and stirring at 30 second intervals until the mixture is smooth. There should be no lumps or clumps. If you don't have a plastic, resealable bag, use a large, plastic container with a lid in stead. You will need to shake the cereal with some powdered sugar, so make sure that whatever container you end up using has enough space for the cereal to move about. Try to spread the cereal mixture as evenly and thinly as possible. It will take about 10 to 15 minutes for them to cool. If you have any left over, put them into an airtight container, and store it in the fridge."

      "People who email, call, or text you asking questions that are already in the ad are likely not very serious buyers. Look for buyers who ask specific questions and seem to have a basic knowledge of motorcycles. Ensure they have cash to offer before agreeing to let them look at the bike. Beware of scams, such as people who want you to ship or deliver the bike without first paying for it. Arrange to meet potential buyers at a time that works with their schedule, which may mean rearranging your own plans. It’s a good idea to meet potential buyers in a public place, like a supermarket, rather than at your home. Choose a spot within walking distance of your home or office, or ask a friend to come along with their car, in case you make a sale. Some buyers will want to ride the bike in addition to inspecting it before they make a purchase. It’s your decision whether or not to let them, but if you agree, you’ll need to make sure they have a motorcycle license or endorsement first. They also need to wear a motorcycle helmet that’s been approved by the Department of Transportation, if you’re in the U.S. It’s a good idea to ask test-riders for collateral—holding onto a copy of their license and the amount of cash you’re asking for the bike is advised. When someone shows up to look at the bike and has the right amount of cash on hand, you can finalize the deal. Be sure to shake on it and write up a bill of sale that includes the new owner’s name and contact information. Remove the license plate and keep the registration card for the bike. Provide the new owner with the keys, the title to the motorcycle, and any other pertinent documents (like the manual or maintenance records). Be sure to let the buyer know that the deal is final, and you aren’t responsible for any issues that may arise in the future.",
      "In each ad or post, be sure to include the year, make, model, and mileage of the motorcycle. List the price and which methods of payment you will accept—cash is best, but you may agree to take a cashier’s check as well. Don’t forget to provide your contact information, too!  Note if there are any aftermarket parts or accessories on the motorcycle. Describe the motorcycle honestly and be upfront about any issues it may have. Provide potential buyers with photos of the bike from various angles, such as each side, the front and back, and close-ups of the cluster and gauges. Be sure the photos aren’t too dark or washed-out and that the images are crisp and clear. If there’s any damage to the bike, include pictures of it so buyers have a realistic idea of what you’re offering. Advertise the bike using sites like Craigslist and eBay in addition to motorcycle-specific sites, like https://www.cycletrader.com. You can also use social media, like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to spread the word. Ask your friends and family to share your posts to expand the audience that sees your ad. Though it may seem like an old-school route to take, many people have found that newspaper ads and paper fliers have helped them sell their bikes. Check to see if your region has a motorcycle magazine or newspaper that you can place an ad in. It’s also a good idea to make fliers and post them on bulletin boards around town, especially at parts stores and popular motorcycle meetup spots. Many motorcycle dealers will sell used bikes on consignment. Visit several motorcycle dealers in your area to determine if they offer this service. Compare the percentage the dealer takes to determine which shop will give you the most money on the sale. Once you choose a dealer, get the consignment agreement in writing. Ensure the dealer has insurance to cover the bike in the event of damage or theft.",
      "To get the most money for the motorcycle, you should clean and detail it before showing it to potential buyers. Clean the chain, engine, wheels, and body of the bike, including the seat. Remove scuff and boot marks, and polish up any chrome pieces to really make the bike shine. While you’re cleaning the motorcycle, take note of any damage, dents, or scratches on it. Look for leaks or other issues the motorcycle may have. Get rid of any corrosion on the battery terminals, and touch up the paint, if necessary. To get the best price, you should replace any visibly worn or broken parts. Check the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) website, the Kelley Blue Book (KBB) website, and the Auto Traders website to get an idea of what similar bikes sell for. You can also view ads for similar bikes on classified sites to help you determine a price. Determine the average price for a similar bike from the information on these sites. Consider the average selling price of a bike like yours, how much money you put into the bike, and if there is any existing damage or maintenance required. These things can help you decide what’s the lowest amount you’ll accept for the motorcycle. Keep in mind that aftermarket parts and modifications don’t increase the value of the bike dollar to dollar—expect to lose money on mods. To give you room to negotiate with potential buyers, list the bike for a little more than you’re willing to accept. Add a few hundred dollars to the total in order to give yourself some wiggle room. Even if the asking price is fair, some people won’t buy a bike if you refuse to come down from the initial price. For example, if your firm price is $1,500, list the bike for $1,800 and let potential buyers talk you down."

      "Items with unfinished leather will have a rough-looking surface. You’ll find leather like this most commonly on items that generally have some wear and tear, such as construction boots, horse saddles, and baseball gloves. Pour a quarter-sized amount of saddle soap onto a clean, damp cloth. After you’ve worked up a good lather of soap on the surface of the leather, flush it clean with water. As per usual, avoid oversaturating the leather with water. If you notice the leather becoming waterlogged, take a short break and let it air dry for a little while to prevent damage. Your cloth might not be enough to clear crevices or bust up severe dirtiness. Be sure to use a very soft bristle brush, like one made from nylon, to protect damage to the surface of the leather. To prevent accidentally damaging the leather, before using a brush, first test it out on an inconspicuous spot of the leather first. Dampen a clean, lint-free cloth in water. Wring out excess moisture then use this cloth to wipe away any remaining soap or dirtiness. Be thorough! Leftover soap will dry out and harm the surface of your leather. Unfinished leather has a tendency to take on water a little more easily than finished leather. Because of this, you should give unfinished pieces at least eight hours to dry, or an overnight period. Pour a leather preservative, such as mink oil, onto the dried item. Using the remaining unused cloth, work a generous amount of oil onto the object, especially into any cracks and areas that look worn. The item is now ready to use.",
      "Hand cleaning is great for spot treating scuff marks and dirt, but it’s also an effective way of deep cleaning leather. Although if your item is expensive or made of hard leather, a professional cleaner might be the safest cleaning method. Pour a small amount of castile soap into a bowl of distilled water. Agitate the solution with your hand or a whisk to distribute the soap and create bubbles.  For even better leather protection, use a soap specially formulated for cleaning leather. These kinds of soaps are available at many general retailers, hardware stores, and craft stores. If you don’t have castile soap or a specialty leather cleaner, you can use a mild soap, like dish soap, as a substitute.  Always test your cleaning solution on an out of sight spot on the leather before using it to clean more visible parts. A normal dishcloth will do if you don’t have better options, but a microfiber cloth will work best. Avoid using any kind of abrasive material, like a scrubbing pad, as these may scratch leather, creating cloudiness in its finish. Generally speaking, harsh cleaners should be avoided when cleaning leather. These can cause a negative reaction the deforms the leather’s surface. Follow the grain of the leather with your cloth as you wipe. In areas where there is caked-on dirt or a tough-to-remove spot, rub using a light, circular motion to remove the debris. Avoid completely saturating the leather with water as you clean, which can damage the leather. You may want to allow the leather to dry a bit if it becomes too wet while cleaning. You should be especially careful to remove all soap when you're done, as it can dry the leather out and cause it to crack. Take a fresh lint-free rag and dampen it with clean water. Wipe all cleaned leather surfaces thoroughly. Arrange the item as it would rest normally on a hanger or suitable surface (like a chair or drying rack) until it air dries completely. Avoid exposing leather items to direct sunlight, as this can dry out the fabric and cause it to crack. This last step will restore the leather's smooth texture and keep it protected. Always follow the conditioner’s directions for the best results, but generally, buff conditioner into the fabric with a clean, dry, lint-free cloth.  Over time, oil that keeps leather supple and resilient disappears from the fabric. Cleaning, especially, can leave leather brittle if you don’t replenish these oils with leather conditioner.  When cleaning finished leather, avoid products such as mink oil and leather waxes. They can destroy the polish and appearance of finished leather products.",
      "It's important that you know from the outset: there's no guarantee that machine-washing your item won't do damage to it. Durable items, like boots or jackets, might be the best candidates for machine-washing.  Don't wash leather that is brightly colored, as color may fade in the washing machine. Avoid washing leather items that have delicate seams or lots of detailing, unless you're comfortable risking damage to these features. If an item is expensive and needs to be cleaned, like a fancy pair of boots or a nice suede jacket, use a spot cleaning method or a professional cleaning service. This gentle soap is relatively easy on leather, which can be damaged by soaps that are more abrasive. Any type of castile soap will do. If you can't find it at the store, you can make your own. Castile soap is used in the same way you'd use regular laundry detergent. Add the soap to your laundry machine in the fashion your machine requires and turn the water setting to “Cold.” To prevent your leather item from taking too much of a beating during the wash cycle, you may want to throw in a few other black items to absorb some shock. Use the gentlest setting your washer has. Turn your leather item inside out, if possible, and then zip all zippers and fasten all fasteners. This process may help “flush” stains out while protecting the visible parts of the leather from damage. Keep an eye on the leather item as it washes. You’ll want to snag it from the washing machine as soon as the cycle is finished, so it doesn't get a chance to dry in there. Leather that is dried crumpled, creased, or misshapen could cause it to permanently deform in these ways. Lay it out flat or hang it up. Smooth out the wrinkles and folds that formed in the wash. In some cases, you may be able to get some additional length out of the leather by pulling in it firmly to stretch it out while it’s still wet. Be careful when stretching the leather. There’s no guarantee it won’t rip, and if it does it won’t be easy or cheap to fix. Avoid letting leather items dry directly in the sun. The sunlight can bake out important oils necessary to keep your leather supple. Hang the items to air dry out of the sun in a room. Open the windows to increase airflow and decrease dry times.  Don't use a hair dryer or any type of directed heat on your leather item. If you use the dryer, make sure it's the \"low\" or \"no-heat\" setting. Leather conditioner will help restore the leather to its previous texture and protect it. Generally, conditioner is applied by being buffed into the leather with a paper towel or soft, lint-free cloth. After the conditioner is applied, the item is ready for use. If you don’t have a commercial leather conditioner, try substituting a light application of olive oil. Apply the olive oil as you would a conditioner – by lightly buffing it into the leather."

      "Even if your friends' lives seem perfect in every way, they probably aren't. If you really get to know your friends, you will find out that not everything is as it seems. They might be struggling at school or they might have a really difficult home life, and these things may be causing them to feel insecure.   Don't point out all of your friends' shortcomings to them. If they are the type of people who feel the need to emphasize their superiority, they will not respond well to this kind of criticism. Instead, use this knowledge to help you better cope with your friends' behavior. Your friends may even be envious of you. Some people have a very hard time accepting that they are not the best at everything, which causes them to put successful people down. Snobs thrive off of other people's willingness to accept that they are inferior to them. If you drool over their expensive clothes or praise them excessively for their accomplishments, you're only fueling their feelings of superiority. Instead, try not to show any emotion when they start bragging. Just say, \"cool\" or \"congratulations,\" and change the subject.  If your friends are genuinely more knowledgeable about a topic than you are, it's fine to be respectful of their knowledge, but if they are acting so superior that they refuse to let you contribute to the conversation, you need to stand up for yourself. Try doing your research so that you are well-informed about the topic. This will put you in a much better position to engage your friends with thoughtful commentary, and maybe even to let them know when they are wrong. If you think your friends might be willing to change their behavior, but need a bit of a wake up call first, you might want to stage an intervention, in which you sit them down and honestly talk to them about how their behavior affects you and the other people around them. You can also suggest ways that they can change. Interventions are typically used for people who are struggling with substance abuse, but they can work well in this kind of situation as well.  Telling narcissistic people that they are arrogant or selfish will only cause them to become defensive, which will likely make their behavior worse. If you are going to confront your friends about their behavior, you need to do it in a nurturing, non-insulting way.  Don't expect too much from this interaction. If your friends truly believe in their superiority, they are unlikely to offer you any recognition or acknowledgement. Even if they don't change, however, you can still be proud of yourself for being a good friend and trying to help them. You can stage an intervention by yourself, but if you have other friends who are also affected by the behavior, a group intervention may be even more effective. While you need to be cautious about insulting your friends' personalities, it is perfectly reasonable to let them know what kinds of behaviors you find unacceptable. Make it clear that if they don't respect the boundaries, you will walk away. If, for example, your friends tease you about your looks, tell them that you are not okay with it and will not tolerate it. The moment they begin to engage in the behavior, you should end the conversation and walk away. Many people who feel the need to put others down do so because they are afraid of being vulnerable and relying on others, not because they are completely lacking in the ability to express empathy. Help your friends feel more comfortable relying on you by praising them whenever they display empathy and by letting them know how special the friendship is to you. It may help your friends let down their walls if you can be a little vulnerable around them. Once they realize that you are not a threat to them, they might be willing to expose their own insecurities. Try having a conversation with them about your fears and encourage them to contribute.",
      "If your friends are making you feel jealous or inadequate, it's important to take a moment to consider how trivial status can be. People outside of your small circle of friends are unlikely to attribute much meaning at all to your friends' elevated statuses. Remind yourself that your friends' superiority is entirely in their own heads. Even if your friends are prettier, wealthier, or smarter than you, try being grateful for the natural advantages that you possess instead of being jealous of what they have. It's important to let go of the childish notion that everything in life needs to be fair. Chances are you can do at least one thing better than your friends. No matter what this thing is, embrace it and do your very best. The point is not to prove to your friends that you are better than them, but rather to prove to yourself that you are worthy and unique.  Instead of comparing yourself to your friends and trying to be as good as them, focus on constantly becoming a better version of yourself. Keep in mind that your friends' success is not in any way related to your own, so their achievements should never take away from yours.  If your friends truly believe they are better than you, they will never recognize your accomplishments, even if you succeed in outdoing them. This is why it's so important to recognize your own accomplishments. Try not to think about what your friends will think about every little decision you make in your life. Chances are, they will put you down whether you try to accommodate them or not, so don't worry about it. Do what makes you happy and don't worry about getting anyone else's approval. If your friends are abusive, deceptive, or in denial about their behavior, it's probably time to end the friendships. You can do so much better, and you will be much happier with friends who treat you well."

      "Pokemon cards are 2 separate cards glued together, a front and a back. Remove them, and keep the back for later. Upload the file to an image editor, preferably one that can support layers, such as Paintshop pro, GIMP 2 or Photoshop. There are many image creating software that allow you to both create and edit. Some must be purchased, like Photoshop, and some are free, like GIMP. There are also websites that specifically cater to creating Pokemon imagery. If you use a website, simply follow the directions given. Search keywords like “Pokemon Card Resources” or simply use a real card as your template. Recreate the Pokémon card template using the tools of the image software. Recreate the border, edit your Pokémon picture, write text for HP, moveset, and any other things that are necessary to get an authentic look. When creating your text it is important to choose the right fonts as they appear on official cards. Search for Pokémon fonts online but keep in mind that some sites may require you to purchase their fonts. Choose a file name that’s easy to remember and file type. Go to the top menu and click 'export' to export the card to a pdf and save it as a JPEG or PNG. Open the PDF file with a Word Processor (ex. Microsoft Word) and resize it to match that of an authentic card (6.3 in width and 8.8 cm in height). Once you've resized it, remember the pixels of the card that you printed, so you can make a back. Make sure to use high quality color ink for best results. You should also consider the cardboard you are going to use. White cardstock works well. Keep in mind the texture of the card. Be careful not to create jagged or slanted edges. Use the back of the card that you saved to ensure that the size matches up.  Glue it to the back of an existing card for rigidity. Apply a transparent tape on the cards to give it a glossy feel  Glue it on with a strong glue such as rubber cement. Use the back of an existing card that you preferably do not care for such as a weak double.",
      "It’s important to come up with a name that represents your Pokémon well. Use the official Pokémon font that can be found using a quick online search. The stronger your Pokémon is, the higher the HP level. You can also be hit more often with a high HP number. How much health your Pokémon will have depends on its type. For example, water types tend to have high health. Additionally, Stage 1 or Stage 2 evolutions will have more health than previous evolutions. Below the image, add 2 or 3 types of attacks. When attacking your opponent, you need to develop a strategy so choose your moves wisely.  As with health, the damage your attacks do is based on the Pokémon's type and evolutionary stage. Different types also have different effects (ie. electric types often have coin flips in their attacks, and fire types commonly make you detach energy to attack). For example, when attacking, you could say, \"Quick Attack, hit!\" If your opponent does not say dodge before you say hit, than your opponent loses however many damage counters the move has. Sometimes, if a Pokémon is very weak to a type of pokemon, you can retreat. Other times, when your opponent is very weak to a certain type of pokemon, and the move has a boost in attack. Keep in mind that you can also use potions, trainer cards and supporter cards together with your moves. Those cards count as one turn. Directly to the right, create how many damage counters the attack move has. Whenever attacking, make sure to check for special conditions. Next to the attacks will be the damage it produces and under will also be either the status it changes to (ex.sleep poison stunned), or instructions to flip a coin to do more damage, depending on heads or tails. On the left side will be the attacks attribute.  Attack attributes often put the defending Pokémon to sleep or continue to deal damage. Before starting a battle, always make sure to check weakness and resistance. The Pokedex number is the order assigned by the International Pokédex. It gives a brief history and characteristics of your Pokemon For example, mushroom pokemon, tiny mouse pokemon, or destruction Pokémon are all valid types. Also, include the height and weight below the image to help distinguish your type. When trading and selling cards, you can find out if it is rare, when you look at the bottom right corner. There will be either a circle meaning not rare, a rhombus meaning uncommon, a star meaning rare, and a shining star meaning very rare. You will find two numbers that indicate how rare a card is. The higher the number the better. If you find a card that looks something like this, (109\\108) that means that you have a rare card. Pokémon cards will list something about the pokemon. For example,  \"Because it is very proud, it hates accepting food from people. Its thick fur guards it from stuns. The illustrator weakness resistance and retreat cost should also located at the bottom of your card. Some cards are rare Holofoil or collectable cards, and usually have a shiny texture. So if you decide to mimic this feature, use glossy material. There are several different types of cards. There are full Art Cards, Holofoils, Reverse Holos, and Old School cards. Old School cards are older cards. They often have different art styles, or red HP. If you are not sure, check the bottom of the card for the date. You cannot buy these cards in stores.",
      "Search keywords “Pokémon card maker” and you should find many online generators. Two popular sites are mypokecard.com or pokecard.net. If you’re going for realism, search for an animated image with the same characteristics as real Pokemon, like sharp edges and bold colors. If you want a funny card or something unique, you can use a photo of yourself or scary animal. Once you’ve chosen your image, upload it onto the site. Choose an image that goes with the type of Pokémon that you’re creating. For example, you might choose a water or fire type, in which case you should make sure the image you choose fits the type. So if you have a photo of an animal shooting water from its mouth, don`t choose fire type. The evolution stage is similar to giving your Pokemon’s age. If it's basic then it’s a kid, if it’s stage 1 then it’s a teen, and if it’s stage 2 then it is an adult. If choosing a name is difficult, think about what your Pokémon represents. Is it funny? Is it powerful? Is it scary? You can name it after its move like “Firebreather” or “Lightning Strike” Each Pokémon has a set of special characteristics and a card maker site will prompt you with what to fill out. This is what makes up your Pokémon and should be fun. Think about the type moves and and weaknesses your card should have.

      "Look on the labels for a coconut oil product that is cold-pressed or expeller-pressed, as these processes extract oil from coconut flakes without any chemicals. Avoid hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Jars of coconut oil are available in most grocery stores in the cooking/baking aisle near other cooking oils, or in the health food aisle. For best results, use coconut oil as a conditioner 1-2 times a week. Soon, you should notice a difference in the quality and strength of your hair. Because the coconut oil needs to set in your hair for at least thirty minutes in order to be effective, it's best to make sure you'll have enough time for the treatment before you begin. Use coconut oil when you know you'll have at least half an hour and up to overnight to leave it in your hair. At room temperature, the oil will be a white, solid material. Use your fingers or a spoon to remove a small clump of oil. Aim for about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) (15 grams) for longer hair, and ½ tablespoon (7 grams) for shorter cuts. Place the oil in a heat resistant container. Place your container of coconut oil in the microwave and cook on high for 30 seconds, or until the coconut oil has turned from a white solid to a clear liquid. Let the container sit for a minute, or until it is cool enough to handle. First, divide your hair into 4 parts, and then split up these parts into ½ - 1 inch (1.5-2.5 cm) wide sections. Use hair clips to help keep these sections apart. It doesn't matter whether your hair is wet or dry for the steps that follow. Coat your fingers in the melted coconut oil. Then, starting at the roots of your hair, and moving all the way to the bottom of your strands, massage the oil into the different sections of your hair. Continue rubbing the oil into your hair until all of the oil is absorbed. This will allow the oil to absorb into your hair. While 30 minutes is the minimum recommended amount of time, leaving the oil in for 2 hours or more is ideal. You can also leave the oil in your hair overnight. If you are going to leave the oil in your hair overnight, place a towel over your pillow, and wear a shower cap to avoid making a mess. After the oil has set in your hair, wash your hair thoroughly. Use a natural shampoo that foams easily; you'll want maximum suds to help cleanse the oil. When you're finished, style your hair as usual.  You might need to shampoo your hair 2-3 times to make sure you've washed all of the oil from your hair. Use a clarifying shampoo if your regular shampoo doesn't work. There is no need to use regular conditioner after you wash with shampoo. The coconut oil will have already done the job!",
      "The coconut oil hair mask should be used once in a while as a rejuvenating treatment to restore dry or damaged hair. If your hair is especially dry and damaged, you can do this treatment multiple times a month, but no more than once a week, or else your hair will become greasy. Put 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (15 grams) of oil in a small, heat-proof bowl and melt it in the microwave. Cook on high for about 30 seconds, or until the oil has liquified. Wait a minute for the oil to cool before proceeding to the next step. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (15 grams) of both honey and apple cider vinegar with the melted oil. It's fine if the oil appears a bit separated from the other ingredients - just be sure they are combined enough so that each spoonful of your mixture appears somewhat uniform. It's best to use organic honey and vinegar products. Comb your hair into 4 parts, and then split up these parts into ½ - 1 inch (1.5-2.5 cm) wide sections. Secure these sections with hair clips or ties. It doesn't matter whether your hair is wet or dry. If you don't have a hair coloring brush, a clean pastry brush or paint brush will also do the trick. Use the brush to coat each section of hair with the mask, and then massage the mask into your hair with your fingers. Once all of the coconut oil is absorbed, gather your hair into a high bun to keep it out of the way. Smooth back all loose strands, and secure with an elastic band or a large claw clip. If you want, you can put a shower cap over your hair to keep your oily bun from coming into contact with your skin. The mask works best when it can set for a couple of hours. The drier your hair is, the longer you should leave in the mask. You should not leave the mask in overnight. As with the oil conditioner, you might need to shampoo your hair 2-3 times to make sure you've washed all of the mask from your hair, or you can use a clarifying shampoo. When you're finished, style your hair as usual."

      "You can use an old face wash bottle, a mason jar, or even an empty bottle. Whatever you choose to use, make sure that it is clean and that it has a lid or cap you can close tightly. You will need a ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters) of liquid Castile soap. Make sure that it is uncolored and unscented. Any dyes or scents may irritate your skin. Chamomile tea has anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce redness. If you wish to use chamomile tea in your face wash, brew a cup of chamomile tea and measure out a ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters). Let the tea cool before adding it to the container. For a more moisturizing cleanser, use raw honey instead. You will need a ¼ cup (56.25 milliliters). Make sure that it is the runny, translucent sort. You will need a ¾ teaspoon of natural oil. Here are the types of oil you can use: avocado, coconut, grapeseed, hazelnut, jojoba, olive oil, sunflower oil, or sweet almond. Essential oils can not only make your face wash smell nice, but some oils can be beneficial to certain skin types. You will need about 8 drops of essential oil. Here are some suggestions:  If you have oily skin, use tea tree oil or any of the following essential oils: bergamot, geranium, or lemongrass. If you have dry skin, consider any of the following essential oils: chamomile, lavender, rose, or sandalwood. If you have mature skin, use any of the following essential oils: geranium, jasmine, lavender, or neroli. Make sure that you are not allergic to the essential oil before adding it to your face wash. If you are not sure if you are allergic to the oil, place a few drops of diluted oil on the inside of your elbow and wait a few hours. If no rash or irritation develops, you can use the oil. You will only need a few drops. It will help moisturize and nourish your skin. Do this for a few minutes until everything is combined. You can use this face wash as you would any other face wash. Because you have used some shippable ingredients, such as chamomile tea and honey, however, you will need to store it in the fridge so that it does not expire.",
      "Dampen your face with warm water. Pour some raw honey onto your fingers and gently massage the honey into your face, avoiding the areas around the eyes and mouth. Rinse the honey off using warm water and pat your face dry with a clean towel. For a deeper clean, allow the honey to sit on your face for 5 to 10 minutes. Create a mixture of oils based on your skin type. Gently massage the oil mixture into your face, avoiding the areas around the eyes and mouth. Place a warm, damp towel on your face, and leave it there for one minute. Take the towel off and repeat it with the other side. You will have a little bit of oil on your face, which is good, but you can wash it off with warm water if it is bothersome. Here are a few oil mixtures to try:  If you have oily skin, use 1 part castor oil or hazelnut oil and 2 parts olive oil or sunflower oil. If you have combination skin, use 1 part castor oil or hazelnut oil and 3 parts olive oil or sunflower oil. If you have dry skin, use pure olive oil, sunflower oil, or coconut oil. You may add a drop or two of castor oil or hazelnut oil. Apple cider vinegar is a natural antiseptic, which makes it a great cleanser and toner. Be sure to use unfiltered apple cider vinegar to get all of the benefits. Unfortunately, apple cider vinegar is acidic so you will need to dilute it with some water. Once you have diluted the vinegar, you can use it as a cleaner and toner by dampening a cotton ball with it and wiping your face with the cotton ball. Avoid sensitive areas such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Here are the proportions you will need, based on your skin type:  If you have oily skin, use 1 part apple cider vinegar and 1 part water. If you have normal skin, use 1 part apple cider vinegar and 2 parts water. If you have sensitive skin, use 1 part apple cider vinegar and 4 parts water. Be sure to do a patch test on the inside of your elbow before using the vinegar-water mixture on your entire face. If you get an allergic reaction, do not use this face wash."

    ],
    "document": [
      "The most important thing to do to change someone’s behavior is to talk about it. Make plans to talk to your friend, and make sure the setting is private and quiet. Your friend may be upset with you when you say how you feel, so a public place may not be the best idea.  Ensure that you have enough time for an in-depth conversation where you can get all of  your thoughts out. An hour-long block should be enough. Choose a private place, such as a quiet park or one of your homes. Avoid restaurants, shops or bars. It may be hard to talk about personal issues with so many people around. Also, a poor reaction from your friend may create an embarrassing situation. Stay respectful and positive, and let your friend know that your relationship is alright but needs some work. You'll want to be direct and explain the issues as clearly as possible. Don't use negative language like \"I'm sick of your selfishness,\" or \"I hate how many favors you ask of me.\"  For a friend who asks too many favors, say: “It really bothers me that you expect so much of me, but you don’t give much in return. ” If they talk about themselves too much, try: \"You spend a lot of time talking about your feelings, but you never have much time to listen to me talk.\" If they always ask for help dealing with drama, say: \"I know you've had some drama lately, but it's difficult for me to keep helping you. You're a great friend, but I feel like I'm doing too much work.\" Selfish people spend most of their time thinking about themselves, and hardly the feelings of others. If you speak directly about how their selfishness makes you feel, it will be a chance to get through to them about their negative behavior.  If they often ask for money, talk about how this makes you feel. For example, it might make you feel as if they only want you for your money, not your friendship. For a friend that constantly complains but has no time for your problems, talk about how you feel less important in the relationship. Some friends may spend time at your house and make messes. Explain to them how frustrated you feel when they don't pitch in. Keep in mind, however, that this may be simply due to growing up in a home where not cleaning up is acceptable. If you are respectful and kind while talking, most likely your friend will offer an apology or give some reasons about why she has been selfish. Make sure to listen closely to the reasons that your friend gives, and try to understand how he or she is feeling.  If your friend says that they never realized how bad their behavior was and wants to fix it, you're on the right track. You may be able to work out a plan. It's not a good sign if they seem uninterested and don't see a need to change. You may need to end this type of friendship. Be understanding if they give excuses, especially if it deals with a big problem, like a death in the family. Wait until they're in a better frame of mind. If your friend values your role in her life, she should agree to start making some changes. Make sure that you are specific about the types of behavior that you would like your friend to work on. For example, if you're tired of them talking all of the time and not listening to you, you could say: \"I'd really appreciate it if you could listen more to what I have to say.\"",
      "Although someone who behaves in selfish ways may be frustrating to be around, it is possible that selfish behavior may indicate that the person is dealing with deeper issues, such as depression or narcissistic personality disorder. Try to avoid judging or labeling your friend as selfish and self-centered. Instead, try to find out what is going on in your friend’s life that may be causing him or her to behave in selfish ways.  For example, you might say, “You seem wrapped up in the negative things that have been happening in your life. What's going on?” Encourage your friend to seek help if they're depressed or dealing with other serious issues. Advise your friend to talk to a school counselor or a therapist. What does your friend do that irritates you? Does she say negative things to you, constantly demand your attention, or talk only about herself without stopping? Get a good handle on exactly what it is that bothers you about your friend.  Some friends ask for help but never give anything in return. In this case, they're taking more from the relationship than they're giving, leaving it one-sided. Others talk themselves all the time but never ask how you are. If you do talk, they seem uninterested. This is another example of a one-sided relationship. Another type of selfishness is attention seeking. They may constantly call you and try to get you to hang out. They don't respect your need for alone-time. The underlying problems of selfishness may give you a little something to go on when talking to the person. You may also be able to develop a little more empathy for your friend if you consider why he or she may be acting in selfish ways.  Selfish or self-centered people may be insecure or have a negative self image. As such, they look for attention or try to get others to think about them. Consider their childhood. Maybe they expect attention because that's what they're used to. Maybe they're desperate for attention because they never got any growing up. Selfishness is a normal human behavior and we are all guilty of it sometimes. Think about times that you’ve been selfish to get some perspective. You may have been selfish unintentionally and hurt others' feelings. For example:  Have you ever interrupted someone during a conversation? Have you ever gotten bored when someone else was talking and started thinking about a problem of your own? Did you ever insist someone to spend time with you, even though you knew that they weren't feeling well?",
      "If your friend starts falling back into their old behavior, say something about it. Do this each time it happens. Let them know how the behavior makes you feel, and remind them that they agreed not to work on it.  Let your friend know when they act selfish, such as constantly seeking attention by spamming you with text messages. If your friend made a promise to fix their behavior, then remind them of that promise. It's possible they forgot, and just need a gentle reminder. Many people behave in selfish ways because other people let it happen. If a person asks for excessive favors or talks about herself without stopping, stop the behavior right away. Don’t allow the person to walk all over you.  For example, if they always talk about themselves whenever you hang out, you could decline the invitation. You could also accept it, but steer the conversation your way. For example, if your friend is always looking for sympathy, stop giving it to them. Instead, offer solutions or help them see the positive side of the situation. If a selfish person treats you poorly, it’s not because you’re not worth being treated well. Selfish people ignore their friends or neglect their obligations because they only think of themselves, and this has nothing to do you or your value as a person. Don’t let your friend’s behavior get to you or make you feel bad about yourself. Spend some time thinking about whether the person has been truly committed to changing. Often, you will see immediate changes because the person is embarrassed and had never realized that she was selfish. Other times, changes will be slower, but you’ll see your friend taking small steps to change. Try to stay patient.  Talk to your friend every few days. See if they're doing better in their personal lives, or whether they're holding up their promise to be less selfish. Hanging out with your friend is a great way to tell if their behavior is changing. Spend time together as you normally would, and see if your friendship feels different or improved. Talk to mutual friends to see if their promise has bled over into their other relationships. Other mutual friends may see an improvement in their behavior, or they may see the same old selfish actions. If the person’s behavior is truly intolerable, take a break from being around them. Selfish behavior is draining to those on the receiving end, and you deserve better. Whether it’s just one day alone or a whole week without seeing them, spend some time to yourself. If they're the type who usually ignores you when you need help, this may help them understand how you feel, and encourage them to change. If you’ve been patient and tried to help the person as much as possible without seeing any results, it might be time to end your friendship. Politely tell your friend that you can no longer see each other, and hold to your promise. While it’s hard to do, toxic and negative people deserve no part in your life."

      "Take note of how you spend your money. Keep a list of every outlay. When you stay accountable this way, you'll tend to be a little more careful. Allocate an amount each payday for food, utilities, entertainment, and whatever other necessities you're committed to.   This completely depends on the size of your paycheck and how much you tend to spend on groceries, clothing and the like. Sometimes you'll have to cut down on some things to make it work and to make sure you aren't stretching yourself too tightly. Create an envelope for each of the above categories. Once you've budgeted your paycheck, you'll fill those envelopes with the amount of cash allotted to each category. For example, if you've allotted $100 for food, you'll put $100 in your food envelope. This means that once you've spent the money in an envelope, that's all you can spend in that category until the next paycheck. So if you blow all your fun money at once, don't take a trip to the ATM to replenish. Take your envelopes seriously.  Don't be stupid. If you're low on groceries, and you've run through all your food money, you might have to borrow from another envelope. Pay it back the next payday. You may need to adjust your budget if you keep running short. You aren't going to get the system 100% right the first time. That's okay. It'll take a few months to get accustomed to budgeting and to figure out how much you need for essentials like food and electricity before you can spend more on clothes and fun things. There will be times when you're going to need to use a debit or credit card. Using plastic, however, is so easy that you may not even feel like you're spending money. That's not good if you're trying to be disciplined with your finances.",
      "Create a file folder or a cabinet or box with sections for all your expenses, insurance, assets, income and liabilities.  You could label the folders this way:   House/apartment Income Insurance Medical Vehicle Utilities Taxes For example, under \"house/apartment\" you would keep mortgage or lease/rent documents.  Under \"utilities\" you'd file gas/electricity, water, sewage, tv/internet, and phone bills. Note everything you spend on entertainment, groceries, and gas. Some expenses are unavoidable, such as mortgage/rent and utilities.  However, you could reduce your monthly expenses in other categories by first determining how much you spend there and how much is absolutely necessary. Do this for at least three months to determine a pattern.  By doing this you get an idea of how often you eat out and how much you spend on movies or other entertainment.  You'll begin to see where you might be able to reduce costs. Write down everything you want to accomplish.  Include estimates of how much your goals will cost and how long before you achieve them.  For example:   \"Buy a house: $200,000 with a 5% down payment. Save $10,000 by June 2020.\" This will give you an idea of how much you need to save to reach your goals. Let’s say you want to buy a $30,000 car.  You can take out a loan for $30,000 that you will need to pay back in three years.  You will have monthly costs (not taking interest into account) of approximately $833. This will reduce the amount of the loan and the interest you'll pay on it.  Be realistic in setting money aside, because you'll have to continue meeting your living expenses. By paying yourself first in this way, you can save money for retirement without even seeing it (and being tempted to spend it). Spend only a part of what's left in each paycheck. Try to save as much of what remains as you can. You may find it hard to maximize your savings, but as you near retirement, you will be very glad you did. Try to maintain an emergency fund consisting of roughly six months' worth of normal expenses. This will help cover costs should you lose your job or become temporarily incapacitated. Using a budget will help. Here are some examples:  Watch matinee movies instead of higher-priced evening showings. Eat out once or twice a month rather than once or twice a week. Make your own coffee and take it to work or school rather than stopping by a coffee stand on your way. Leave your credit cards home when going shopping. If you're determined to use a card, pick one with a generous rewards program. Don’t go grocery shopping when you're hungry. You may buy more than you need at such times."

      "  Use a small and stiff brush to trace, an eyeliner brush will do. This will define your eyes more. Blend it well with a small fluffier brush, but keep it dark. If you're going for a more theatrical Twiggy-like look, don't blend at all! Use a black gel liner, or liquid, trace your crease shape, let it set, and that's it. You can go back and refine the crease a bit, but keep it very sharp and neat looking. This is also known as 'feathering'. Make it look neat. (Before the next step, if you want, you may apply false lashes)  This makes your lashes look thicker and longer. Do not try to put on too many layers of mascara as this may make your eyelashes clump together and look \"spidery\". If you are planning on drawing on your bottom eyelashes like Twiggy's, don't put on much mascara on your bottom lashes.  But generally, you should use eyelashes that are long and thick but still look somewhat natural. Use the appropriate eyelash glue. Some pairs of false eyelashes come with pre-packed glue but it is better if you buy a separate eyelash glue tube - the applicator is often 10 times more precise. This can be very tricky unless you have experience. If possible, try having someone with a steady hand apply the lashes for you.",

      "While you typically don’t want to go too bold with the rest of your makeup, it’s important to add some color to your face with a smokey eye. That’s because the dark eyeshadows can make you look pale and almost sickly. Apply a rosy or peachy blush to the apples of your cheeks and blend it back toward your hairline to liven up your skin. If you’re not a fan of blush, swap it for your favorite bronzer. Dust it over the tops of your cheekbones to add warmth and color to your skin.",
      "To create a smokey eye, you will need to work with a dark palette. A traditional smokey eye uses blacks and grays, but you can use dark hues of almost any color. Browns, golds, purples, greens, and navy blues all also work well for smokey eyes. You will need a dark eyeliner, a medium-dark eyeshadow, and highlight shadow in the same color group to make your smokey eye.  Look for colors and shades that match your skin tone. If you have very fair skin, a mid-tone shadow may be dark enough for a smokey eye with your complexion. If you have ebony skin, you’ll need to use a very deep shade to create a smokey eye. Think about how you want to wear your smokey eye. A lighter, more subtle look could be dressed up or down during the daytime, while a very dark, dramatic smokey eye can be a bold statement when you plan to go out for the night. A basic smokey eye usually starts with eyeliner. Use a creamy pencil liner, and run it along your upper and lower lash lines. You should keep the liner thinner on the lower lash line, but you can go a little thicker across the upper lash line. Next, smudge the liner with a small brush, your finger, or a cotton bud to soften it. Using your finger to smudge the liner will give your smokey eye a messier, grungier look if you prefer that type of makeup."

      "Thawing Your Milk"
    ],
    "document": [
      "When milk freezes, it takes up a little more space that when it's liquid. If your milk's container is filled to the brim, this can cause it to burst in the freezer, making a huge frozen mess (this is especially true for hard glass jugs). Luckily, this is easy to prevent — just pour off about a cup of milk so that you have a few inches of room at the top of the container. Doing this gives the milk plenty of room to expand. On the other hand, if you've already drunk more than a cup or two of your milk, you can usually skip this step. Once you freeze your milk, the expiration date on the jug becomes basically meaningless unless you thaw it again right away. For this reason, it's a wise idea to label your container with both today's date and the number of days remaining before it expires. You can write this directly on the container with a marker, or, if you prefer not to mark your container, you can use a piece of masking tape as a label. For example, if it's August 24th and the milk expires on August 29th, we might label the container with the text \"Frozen: Aug. 24 — five days to expire\" so that we'll know how long we have to drink the milk when we thaw it in a month or two. You're all ready to freeze your milk — simply set your labeled container in a freezer with a temperature below 0o F/C. If you can't fit the entire container in the freezer, consider dividing the milk into several smaller containers. Within about a day, the milk should be frozen solid. When the milk is frozen, you may be able to see the separation of the milk and the fat. Don't worry — this is a normal part of the freezing process and is perfectly safe. Most sources recommend leaving your milk in the freezer for a maximum of either two or three months. Some sources even recommend freezing milk for up to six months. The general consensus seems to be that milk can last a very long time in the freezer but that it will gradually absorb the flavors and odors of other items in the freezer over time, becoming less appealing to drink. Note that richer dairy products, like eggnog, buttermilk, and cream generally have similar shelf lives to ordinary milk (or slightly shorter) when frozen — usually on the order of one to two months or so. As an alternative to freezing your milk in its container, you may want to consider pouring a portion into ice cube trays. This is an especially good choice for people looking to use their frozen milk in baking projects, as it allows you to quickly add semi-standard portions of milk to your recipe rather than having to chip away at a single solid block of milk or wait for it to thaw. Frozen milk cubes are also good for adding to glasses of fresh milk — they keep it cold, but won't dilute it when they melt like ordinary ice cubes.",
      "Assuming your milk was fresh when you froze it, its \"freshness\" should be almost the same after thawing it. Thus, most thawed milk is good for drinking and using in cooking projects for about a week after thawing. Though its appearance and consistency may be slightly different, it should still be safe to consume. Note that if your milk wasn't fresh when you froze it, it won't be fresh thawed, either. In other words, thawed milk that was only a day or two from spoiling when you froze it will be in roughly the same state when it's thawed. It's worth noting that  you don't have to shake the milk by hand to redistribute the fat. Using a mechanical solution like a blender or food processor, for instance, allows you to quickly and easily agitate the milk for a smoother, more even texture. This can also help you break up any ice chunks remaining in your milk, which can be a surprise if they aren't discovered before you start drinking. Thawed milk can sometimes have a different \"feel\" than ordinary milk — it's sometimes described as being slightly chunky and watery by comparison. Though thawed milk is perfectly safe to drink, these qualities can make it difficult for some to drink. On the other hand, thawed milk is usually an excellent substitute for fresh milk in cooking and baking projects where its altered texture is difficult or impossible to detect.",
      "The trick to thawing frozen milk is to use a slow, gradual process, never a quick one. For this reason, the easiest way to thaw your milk is usually simply to transfer it from the freezer to the refrigerator. The slightly warmer temperatures of the refrigerator will allow the milk to thaw to a liquid state little by little. This can take some time — depending on the volume of your frozen milk, it's not uncommon for it to take up to three days to thaw completely in the refrigerator. If you're in a hurry to thaw your milk, try filling your sink with cold water (not hot water) and submerging your frozen milk container in it. Use a heavy object like a cast iron pot to hold the milk underwater as it thaws. This process will be quicker than thawing the milk in the refrigerator but will still usually take several hours, so be patient. The reason that water thaws milk more quickly than the refrigerator has to do with the way that energy is transferred between the milk and its surroundings at a molecular level. Liquids transfer heat energy into ice much more effectively than air, making them a much quicker method of thawing. Never try to thaw your frozen milk quickly with heat. This is a sure-fire method for ruining your milk and undoing your hard work. Heating the milk can cause it to thaw unevenly or even burn, leaving you with a very unappealing finished product. Listed below are just a few tips for avoiding this situation:  Don't leave your frozen milk out at room temperature. Don't thaw your milk in the microwave. Don't thaw your milk in hot water. Don't thaw your milk in a pot or pan on the stove. Don't thaw your milk in the sun."

      "Good selfies set up the photo in an aesthetically pleasing way. Framing your face in the middle isn’t usually the best composition. Instead, consider placing yourself in the top right or top left corner. Try to position your eyes about one-third of the way down from the top of the photo. They should also be to the side, not in the middle. When taking a good picture of yourself, lighting plays a crucial role. Fluorescent lights are generally not the most flattering, while soft and golden light gives you a much better selfie. Posing outside, or near a window, can provide great lighting for selfies.  When taking a photo in direct sunlight, try blocking the sun with your head. That way, you won't squint, and the sun will light your hair up like a halo. Photographers call the time around sunrise and sunset the \"golden hour,\" when the light is warm and soft. Strong candle-light can also be attractive, but be careful when lighting your face from below. Tilt your chin down so the light can catch your cheekbones. Nice restaurants, cafés, galleries, and changing rooms in high-end stores often have flattering lighting. To get the color balance right, hold a white object within your selfie frame. This will help your camera find the right balance of cool and warm tones. Hold a napkin, a piece of paper, or some other white object just within the frame of your selfie. Crop it out when you've taken the shot. If you're wearing a white shirt, hat, or sunglasses, you don't need to worry about this. A selfie stick will let you get more of your figure and the background into a shot. They tend to take slimming photos since they can be held very high. Hold the selfie stick up and tilt your face towards the camera.",
      "Straight on photos are generally not as flattering as a photo where your face is angled. Look into your camera, or use a mirror, and examine your face from various angles. Most people prefer one side of their face to the other, so tilt that side toward your camera to take a good selfie. Swivel each of your shoulders away from the camera one at a time to help figure out your best angle. Pictures shot from above are more flattering than those shot from below. Raise your arms slightly to take the photo from an elevated position. Hold the camera just slightly above face level. Don't hold the camera so high that you look shrunken. Gently angle your chin downwards, towards the floor. Holding your chin slightly down and the camera slightly up shows the harmonious flow of the cheekbones toward the lips. This angle may work best if your forehead is on the shorter side. Holding your head the right way can help you avoid any double chin or awkward faces. When posing, extend your neck so that your face is closer to the camera. It may feel weird, but it will help you look better in a selfie. This angle helps define your jawline.",
      ". To get a smile that looks real, don't force a grin. If you're feeling happy, just think of how happy you are and smile. If you aren't really there but you want a smiley selfie, relax and let a good feeling come to you. Take a deep breath and let it out. Think of someone who makes you happy, and imagine smiling at them. Let your eyes crinkle up slightly when you smile, but don't force it by squinting. The eyes are the star of the selfie. Look directly at the camera lens when you pose so that it looks like you're looking at the viewer. Smiling and making eye contact will help you look friendly and inviting.  For a coy look, try casting your eyes downward and to the side. Widen your eyes and raise your eyebrows slightly to look alert, innocent, or surprised. . Pouting deepens the lines of your cheekbones and makes your lips look fuller. Try whispering the word \"prune\" for a perfect pout. If you exaggerate your pout, you may get a \"duck face\" expression, which many consider silly. Smiling is only one way to interest people in your selfie.  Try frowning, winking, sticking out your tongue, opening your mouth as if surprised, or biting your lip.  For a cute puppy look, try sticking out your lower lip while tilting your chin down and looking right into the camera. Relaxing your face so that your expression is blank can be flattering, but your photo won't be as interesting.",
      "To slim your waist and show off your shoulders and hips, turn your body slightly when you take your photo. If you're standing, shift your weight onto one foot to give your torso a more angular posture. Use the arm that isn't taking the shot to frame your figure. Try putting a hand high on your waist to frame your torso, or crook your elbow and put a hand behind your head to show off your upper arm. Bend your knee or cross your legs for a more dynamic position. When taking a lying-down selfie, don't let your face get swallowed up by gravity. Use a pillow, or put a hand behind your head. Take the photo from slightly above your eye level, just as if you were standing. It can be tricky to fit a lot of your body into the frame without distorting your proportions. A mirror lets you take a picture without worrying about that. If you have two mirrors facing one another, you can even take a picture of your back and front at once.  Mirror shots look best if the light is next to the mirror, rather than behind you. Try putting a lamp next to your mirror, or keep a mirror by your window. Try shooting from right next to your face or closer to your chest. If you don't want the camera to show, hold it just past the mirror frame.",
      "When you take a two-handed selfie, you can hold the phone with more stability and click the picture button without dropping the phone. The two-handed selfie lets your arms frame the picture, almost as if you were hugging the viewer. Hold the camera away from your body with both hands. Use one hand to keep the phone or camera secure while the other hand hits the button. Just be careful not to cover up the lens. If you're taking a selfie on Snapchat, WeChat, or a similar app, you can embellish your pictures with filters and frames. Take a selfie wearing a virtual flower crown, draw a funny mustache on yourself, or write a message across your face. Selfies are a great opportunity to show everyone what you are doing. Take your selfie while doing something interesting. This may be posing in front of a tourist attraction or monument, sitting on a horse, or eating something colorful and delicious."

      "Different telescopes are better for different types of viewing. There are really on three basic telescope types: refractor, reflector and catadioptric. Which one you choose will be based on what you want to observe, where you are, and so on.  The refractor basically has a long thin tube with an objective lens at the front that collects and focuses the light. This one is better for viewing the Moon and planets, usually giving a nice, crisp image. It travels well and doesn't need much maintenance. Unfortunately, it is very hard to see faint objects like galaxies and nebulae. The reflector employs a large concave mirror rather than a lens for the purposes of accumulating and focusing light. This is one of the better beginner telescopes and it usually has pretty good visibility, although water has a tendency to condense on the optics of the telescope which can be irritating. Also, you can't view terrestrial objects with this telescope. The catadioptric is a compound telescope, combining both lenses and mirrors. They are good photographic telescopes and they are a lot easier to carry than the reflector. This one tends to be more versatile, but they do tend to be more expensive than the other types. You'll need different power levels considering where you are. If you have an area where the light pollution is better or worse. If you are in an area where it rains more, etc.  If you want to bird watch (for example) with your telescope, you'll be better off not choosing the reflector telescope because it won't show you terrestrial objects. If you're in a place where it dews frequently and you're planning on using your telescope at night, you'll need to consider whether choosing a refractor or catadioptric telescope might be your best option. Objects like the planets, the Moon, and closer stars need a high power, good contrast and sharp resolution in a telescope. So if this is what you want to look at, your best bet is to go with a refractor or a reflector. If you're looking at faint objects such as galaxies and nebulae, you'll need a bigger aperture and choose a big reflector telescope. People generally have the mistaken impression that more power automatically means higher resolution and better viewing, but this is not actually true. High power simply dilutes the brightness of the image and amplifies any blurriness.  For any telescope the maximum amount of magnification equals 50-power per inch of aperture. So say you have a 6-inch reflector. 300-power is as high as you should go (for a 3-inch reflector it would be about 150-power). Even if you're using a Barlow lens, magnifying it too far will only result in a blurred image. The telescope's image can only be blown up to a certain point.",
      "Before you start tromping around in the dark with your expensive telescope, you'll need to figure out what you're looking for. Maybe you want to have a gander at the moon, or want to check out the planets. Maybe you're interested in a meteor shower. You'll need to find out timing, place, weather, etc.  If you're trying to observe the stars, for instance, going out on a moon-lit night won't get you very far. Look at books on stars and constellations. These will tell you when the best viewing times are and when the planets are easiest to be seen. Examine sky charts so that when you are out in the dark you know where to point your telescope. Train your eye. To do so, make sketches of the moon and the planets. You don't have to be a great artist to capture them as accurately as possible. This will help you to look more closely at the sky and observe details. You'll need to choose your spot carefully, once you've decided what you're looking for and where it will be. It will need to be accessible at night and have a place with solid level ground for your telescope's tripod.  You'll need to consider light pollution. For instance, if you're in a big city, going up on a high roof (As long as it is safe) can get you away from the worst of the light pollution and allow you to see more clearly. Try to avoid decks and blacktop driveways and concrete. Footsteps on a deck can cause vibrations in the image. Blacktops driveways and concrete can create thermal issues for your telescope. You'll need to practice setting up your telescope and pointing to the correct part of the sky before you start fiddling around at night. Otherwise it is very easy to lose bits of your telescope and forget how to do something. For practice set up your telescope and, using the lowest power eyepiece, point the main scope at something about 100 feet (30.5 m) away like a tree (not the sun!). Center the object in your crosshairs and make sure it's clear. Switch to  a higher powered eyepiece and try again. Make sure that when you're having your big night out with the stars that you have dressed appropriately. If it is going to be cold, make sure you have the right clothes on and bring along a canister of something warm.",
      "This is typically attached the side of the telescope. It displays more of the sky than the scope itself. For instance, a 50 power telescope covers an area about as small as the fingernail on your little finger, whereas an 8x finderscope covers an area about the size of a golf ball. Telescopes typically come in two types: equatorial or altazimuth. You'll need to know which kind of telescope you have so you can learn how to operate your telescope.  Altazimuth mount operates my going up and down and side to side, making it easier for beginners to operate. It is more simple than the equatorial telescope. Equatorial mount swings across the celestial North to South and East to West. The polar axis (which is the rotating part closer to the telescope's base) needs to be aligned to Polaris, the North Star. It will then follow the motion of the sky around this point, moving from east to the west (as the stars move). It takes more time to get accustomed to the equatorial mount each time you want to look at a different star or planet you have to unlock the axis  and take aim at the heavenly body using the finderscope and lock it once you have the general location. From there you'll use the slow motion cable controls or panhandle controls to make the smaller movements. The equatorial mount is generally considered to be more helpful. You'll need to make sure that the three legs of your telescope are properly balanced otherwise the telescope can fall over and become damaged. When you're scouting out locations, always look for areas that have a flat, level area for your telescope."

      "The traditional champagne flute – a tall, narrow glass – will preserve carbonation best. A wine glass with a slight belly-bulge at the bottom will allow more of the nose of the wine to accumulate without providing too much loss of carbonation.  A champagne coupe is a wide mouth glass seen most often in the champagne glass pyramids at weddings. These are not ideal for the dry champagnes that are popular today, as they give up lots of the carbonation and do not maintain the vapors as well for the pungent aroma part of the experience. For an extra special presentation, create a champagne pyramid using champagne coupe glasses. It's best to opt for a less expensive type of champagne for this type of presentation. To pop the cork of a champagne bottle quietly and safely, first you need to loosen the muselet (the wire cage that fits over the outside of the cork), but don't remove it completely. Then hold the champagne bottle at a 45̊ angle and begin rotating the base of the champagne bottle. Keep doing this until the cork loosens and pops off. If you are serving champagne in a restaurant setting, it is common practice to present the bottle to the host of the party you are serving with the label facing them so they can read inspect and read the bottle. You may also serve a small sample to the host for their approval before dispensing the champagne to the other guests. Serve your customers in a clockwise fashion. The pouring aspect is very important because if the champagne is poured incorrectly, it can lose its distinctive bubbly taste. To correctly pour champagne, you should hold the bottle with one hand firmly at the base with your thumb in the punt (the depression) and spread your fingers out along the body of the bottle.  Pour the champagne against the side of the glass rather than directly into the bottom. This will help the champagne maintain more of its bubbles.  Additionally, remember that many bottles of champagne are stored in dank cellars that are less than spotless as far as clean storage conditions go. For this reason, you should never let the bottle touch the glass in any way as you pour. In general, you'll find that champagne varieties pair well with cheeses, shellfish, lobster, shrimp, crab (in light sauces), oysters, sashimi, salmon roe, fish cakes, tempura, poultry, Asian foods, dishes containing basil and coriander, soy, wasabi, and desserts, including, of course, wedding cake.  Dry champagne styles can be used as a palate cleansing aperitif, such as after eating salty snacks or sushi. Or, finish a meal with champagne to cleanse the palate, rather than having dessert. Champagne and sparkling wines are a good combination with rich and creamy food because of the strong acidity of the wine, especially dry champagne styles. Mid-sweet and very sweet sparkling wine styles (carbonated pop wines and very sweet spumantes) are best for drinking for fun, adding to punch, and enjoying with sweet desserts like ice cream or gelato. They also pair well with spicy foods as the can help balance out the dish. Rosé styles contain tannin and are good for matching with rich fish dishes, such as ocean trout or salmon. Serious red champagne styles (bottle-fermented, not the carbonated pop wine style) are great matched with red meat, game, and turkey dishes. Champagne can also be made into champagne cocktails, paired with a range of liqueurs and spirits that result in a mixed drink or even used in cooking or baking. It's just another twist on a way to serve your champagne, although it's probably best to reserve this serving use for less esteemed champagnes!  For example, to make a very simple champagne cocktail, place 1 sugar cube in a champagne glass, add 5 drops of Angostura bitters, then fill the glass two thirds full with chilled champagne. Garnish with a slice of orange or a strawberry half. If you use slightly less than two-thirds a glass of champagne, then you should get approximately 5 cocktails from 1 standard champagne bottle.   Make champagne sorbet for dessert.  And if you have flat champagne, don't let it go to waste! Try making champagne cake, a brilliant solution to using leftover champagne in a tasty way.",
      "For a long time, all sparkling wine was referred to as \"champagne\" until many countries chose to apply the \"rules of appellation.\" This restored the technical designation of champagne so that it referred only to those sparkling wines grown and made in the Champagne region of northeastern France.  Champagne from the Champagne region continues to be the \"gold standard\" of sparkling wine because the climate is cool and combines with the chalky soil to produce very acidic grapes, ideal for making sparkling wine. Moreover, champagne from this region tends to be aged for years rather than the months of aging allowed for most other varieties.  In other regions where sparkling wine is produced, it tends to be referred to as: Cava in Spain; Sekt in Germany; Spumante or Prosecco in Italy; and sparkling wine in Australia,  the US, New Zealand, and South Africa. Bottle-fermented champagne and sparkling wine have a more labor-intensive production and the price should reflect this, while carbonated styles should be a lot cheaper. Mostly you get what you pay for with champagne and sparkling wine – so the more you pay, the better the experience. Different methods can be used to create champagne, including the method champenoise, charmat, or cube close, which require varied lengths of time of fermentation in the bottle. A less time- and labor-intensive process is that of carbonating a still wine (known in some places as \"carbonated pop wines\"), which can still produce a pleasant sparkling wine. Most, but not all, sparkling wine is white and dry (brut) following the French Champagne style, while others are sweet in the Italian Asti Spumante style. You can also try prosecco, which is sparkling wine made in the Veneto region of Italy. If you fancy a little color for your dinner party, there are also some rosé sparkling wines (pinkish to red shades), as well as some red sparkling wines from such places as Australia and Argentina. While there is a wide variety available to choose from, some good choices include:  Champagne: Dom Pérignon, Taittinger Comtes de Champagne, and Krug Grande Cuvée. Spumante: Asti, Franciacorta, and Trento. Prosecco: Nino Franco, Luna d'Or NV, La Marca, and Zonin. Sparkling wine: Schramsberg, Roederer Estate, Domaine Carneros, Tasmanian sparkling wines, and Marlborough region sparkling wines.",
      "Before you're ready to serve it, keep your champagne (and all wine) in cool-but-not-cold conditions with little direct light and very little variation in temperature. Basements that stay between 40ºF and 60ºF (4ºC-15ºC) are perfect. Horizontal storage helps prevent the wine from spoiling and allows the cork to remain moist, which will help keep the air out and keep the gas in. This is an important factor in maintaining the flavor and bubbles in your champagne. Colder champagne tastes better, but it is also less likely to bubble over when you open it. The ideal drinking temperature is between 45ºF and 48ºF (7ºC-9ºC). If you've got the time, 4 hours or more in a refrigerator will be enough to put your champagne into the proper range. The classic way to chill champagne is in an ice bucket. Champagne buckets are frequently larger than other wine chilling buckets to allow for more water and ice. You should fill the bucket with half water and half ice and let it chill for 15-20 minutes before serving."

      "Your bestie might not understand or accept what’s happening, so it’s possible that they will start calling, texting, and messaging you more when you stop communicating with them. If this happens, don’t pick up the phone and don’t respond to texts or social media messages right away. Wait a few days to get back to them, and then keep your responses brief.  If they ask a question that can be answered with a yes or a no, respond this way and don’t offer any other information. If they ask you something requiring a longer response, keep it as brief and impersonal as possible. Your best friend might try to make plans with you when you start distancing yourself from them. If this happens, make an excuse for why you can’t. Say you already have plans, you don’t feel well, you have homework, or anything else you can think of to get out of it. Don’t offer an alternative time either, just make the excuse and leave it at that.  For example, if they ask what you’re doing over the weekend, try saying something like, “I’m busy this weekend. I have plans with my family.” If they try to get you to suggest a time to hang out, try saying something like, “I’ve got a lot going on right now, so I can’t really make any plans.” Your best friend might be used to you doing whatever they want. If this is the case and you can’t get out of seeing them for some reason, then flip the script on them and become very unaccommodating. This may cause them to dislike spending time with you and decrease their interest in doing it again. For example, if you usually meet them at their house, say that they need to meet you at your house instead. Bumping into people can be opportunities for connection and intimacy, so it’s important to maintain your distance if you encounter your best friend unexpectedly. Stick to neutral topics and keep information about yourself to a minimum.  For example, if they ask what’s new with you, try saying something like, “Not much.” If you don’t want to talk with your ex-bestie at all, you can always just keep walking. A polite smile and wave is fine, too, if you want to be friendly. If you have resolved to break up with a friend, you will need to stop contacting them altogether at some point. After you have distanced yourself from them for a few weeks, stop contacting them. Don’t call them, text them, or message them on social media. If you often bump into them on your way to work or school, take a different route. If you attend the same school or work together, ask to sit somewhere away from them.",
      "Avoid meeting up at their home or yours to talk, but you may also want to avoid meeting in a crowded public place, such as the school cafeteria. Instead, pick a place that is neutral, such as a café or park. This will help to ensure that neither of you has an advantage. You will also both be able to go your separate ways after the conversation, rather than one of you having to leave the other person’s space. Telling them face-to-face is preferable, but you can text them if you’re worried about their reaction, such as if they have a bad temper and you’re afraid they might lash out at you. Reflect on your reasons for wanting to end the friendship. Then, tell the person why you don’t want to remain friend based on these reasons. Avoid starting sentences with “you” when you do this as this may cause them to become more defensive.  For example, you might say something like, “I don’t think we should be friends any more. I feel hurt when you never ask me about what’s happening in my life.” Or, you might say, “I think we should take a break. I feel sad when you criticize my looks and pressure me to change things about myself.” “I” statements are less likely to cause your bestie to feel defensive, so it’s important to craft what you want to tell your best friend in this format. to their response, but remain firm in your decision. After you have said how you feel, they might want to respond. Be willing to listen to them, but stick with your decision. Don’t allow them to sway you if you’ve made up your mind about breaking up with your best friend. Make eye contact with them, nod your head to show you’re paying attention, and put away anything that might distract you, such as your phone. Try to keep your body language open while you listen to them, too, such as by facing them, keeping your arms at your sides, and leaning in towards them. It is possible that your best friend will want to hash out the details of why you are breaking up with them, but this is unlikely to resolve anything. If they start to drag out past arguments or a list of their perceived wrongs, stop them and excuse yourself. For example, you could say, “I don’t want to get into this because I don’t think it will solve anything.” Try saying something to indicate that you mean the person no ill will, even though you don’t want to remain friends. You can say something to indicate that you’ll cherish your memories together or that you will still be polite and friendly when you encounter them. Try saying something like, “I’ll always remember the good times we had together,” or “I wish you the very best!”",
      "Ask another friend or a supportive family member to meet up with you to talk or call them up. Tell them what happened and how you’re feeling. If the person is friends with your ex-bestie, make sure that they feel comfortable talking with you about the breakup first. After breaking up with your best friend, you might need to talk things over with someone you trust. To protect yourself from seeing your friend’s images and posts, unfriend them or at least unfollow or mute them on social media. They will likely do the same with you, so don’t feel bad about it. You might even consider taking a break from social media for a few weeks or longer. This will eliminate the chance that you’ll stumble on a post they’re tagged in or a post that reminds you of them. Seeing your ex-best friend’s pictures and posts every day will make getting over the breakup even harder on you. Make plans with other friends and family members to occupy your newfound free time. Plan fun activities that you will be excited about doing. For example, you could arrange for a group of friends to go bowling or mini-golfing with you over the weekend, ask your family to accompany you on a hike, or join a local club or special interest group to make some new friends. Having things to look forward to will help you to feel better and keep you busy. Your other friends might be curious about why you and your best friend broke up, but there’s no need to get into it. This could lead to awkwardness and make your other friends feel like you expect them to pick sides. Instead, come up with a simple way to explain what happened if people ask. Try saying something like, “We just don’t spend that much time together anymore.” Try setting a personal, professional, academic, or fitness goal for yourself and identify ways that you can work towards it. For example, if your goal is to finish writing a book that you started, commit to writing every day for 30 minutes. If you want to get a promotion at work, take on extra tasks and volunteer for special projects to set yourself apart from your coworkers. Having a goal can be a good way to focus your attention and avoid dwelling on what happened between you and your best friend. Reflect on the friendship and what killed it to identify things you might do differently in the future. For example, if you broke up with your friend because they were really negative and it rubbed off on you, you might gravitate towards more positive people in the future.  Or, if you broke up with your friend because they were really clingy and you needed space, then you might seek out friends who are more independent. Breaking up with your best friend is a difficult process, but you can learn and grow from it like any other experience."

      "Cleaning Cast Iron",
      "Seasoning Cast Iron"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Iron is highly susceptible to rust, which can be caused when the metal is exposed to air and water. Seasoning your cast iron pan regularly will help prevent it from rusting. It’s important to remove rust spots immediately if they do begin to form, otherwise they will quickly spread.  Wet a mildly abrasive sponge or scrub pad with soapy water and scrub the rusted spots on the pan. To remove tough rust spots, try a bit of vinegar on the sponge.   Rinse the pan under hot water. Re-season the pan by coating it in vegetable shortening and baking it in the oven for an hour. There are a few things you can do to a cast iron pan that will virtually guarantee rust. To prevent rust from forming, avoid exposing the metal to moisture as much as possible:  Never immerse cast iron directly in water. Clean the pan by running water over, rather than submerging it in a full sink. Always dry cast iron cookware fully after using and washing. Store the pans in cupboards or from hooks with the lids off. Lids can trap air and moisture against the surface of the pan, and this will cause the metal to rust. The seasoning layer will protect your cast iron from small amounts of acid, so it’s ok to cook mildly acidic foods in your pan for short periods of time. But acidic foods that require long simmering times, such as tomato sauce, should be cooked in other cookware.  With a long-simmering acidic food, the acid can find weak spots in the seasoning layer, and this can eat away at the seasoning and start to corrode the metal. Be sure to remove acidic foods from your cast iron as soon as they're cooked, and wash the pan immediately. Always wash your cast iron by hand, and never put it in the dishwasher. The dishwasher will expose the pan to too much moisture, and this can lead to rust.  You should also avoid metal scouring pads on the cast iron, as these can damage the seasoning layer.  Harsh soaps and detergents can also remove the seasoning, so avoid them unless you plan to re-season the pan right away. Never pour cold water into a hot cast iron pan, as this can lead to cracking and warping. If your pan is still hot from cooking, only use hot water to clean it.",
      "Clean your pan as soon as possible after cooking with it. The longer food cools in the pan, the harder it will be to clean. After cooking with your cast iron pan, hold it under hot running water. While the water is running, wipe the pan out with a clean cloth to remove food particles.  For mildly soiled and well-seasoned pans, this may be all you need to clean your cast iron. If you're worried about bacteria because you aren't using soap, just make sure to preheat your cast iron before adding food. Cast iron heats up very quickly, and even over medium heat the pan will quickly reach temperatures high enough to kill any bacteria. For food that’s still stuck on your pan or baked-on leftovers, sprinkle the inside of a warm pan with a generous layer of coarse salt. Scrub the surface of the pan with a damp dish cloth to remove the stuck-on food. When the food has been removed, discard the salt and scraps and rinse the pan out with hot water. Remove excess water from the pan by drying it with a towel immediately after cleaning it. Return the pan to the stove and warm it over low heat until all the water has evaporated, about two minutes. Never let cast iron cookware air dry, as this will cause the iron to rust. With the pan still on low heat, coat it with an additional layer of vegetable shortening, using a cloth or paper towel to spread the shortening evenly over the pan. Leave the pan on the heat for another 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside to cool. Before putting it away, wipe out any excess shortening with a cloth or paper towel. Fully seasoning a pan is a process that happens over time. As you add more oil to the pan and cook fatty foods in the cast iron, the surface will become more protected and more non-stick.",
      "Set your oven to 325°F (163°C) and let it heat up. The process of seasoning cast iron involves coating it with a layer of oil and baking it. Seasoning, or curing, the pan will cover it with a non-stick surface, make the pan easier to clean, and protect it from rust.  Most new cast iron pans come pre-seasoned, but you'll have to season any that haven't been cured by the manufacturer.  You can still season a new pan if it comes pre-seasoned, and you should definitely season an old or second-hand cast iron pan before using it. Fill a sink with a small amount of hot, soapy water. Immerse a clean sponge in the soapy water, then wash the cast iron pan. Rinse the pan under hot water and dry it completely with a clean towel.  You can also use a dish brush with stiff bristles to clean the pan. Most people recommend not washing cast iron with soap once it has been seasoned, because the soap can slowly remove the seasoning. However, because you're about to season the pan, use soap now to make sure the pan is clean. Dip a clean cloth or paper towel into some vegetable shortening. Rub the shortening over the inside and outside of the skillet to coat the pan with a thin and even layer. It’s best to use a small amount of solid shortening for seasoning, because too much shortening or using liquid oil can leave a sticky residue on the pan. Place a cookie sheet or piece of foil on the bottom rack of the oven. Then place the skillet upside down on the middle rack. Bake the empty skillet for an hour. The baking sheet is important because it will catch any shortening that melts and drips off the pan. After an hour, turn off the oven. Leave the skillet in the oven as it cools, about one to two hours. Remove the pan from the oven once it’s cool. Buff the pan by rubbing it with a paper towel or clean cloth to remove excess shortening. When you're finished, the pan should be a smooth and shiny black. Over time, this non-stick layer may wear away, especially if you use the pan to cook non-fatty foods. Repeat the seasoning process every few months, or when:  The pan loses its luster and becomes dull The color changes from black to dark gray Food starts sticking to the pan"

      "Making a Heartfelt Apology",
      "Earning Her Forgiveness",
      "Understanding Her Point of View"
    ],
    "document": [
      "Start out with a heartfelt apology. A simple, “I am really sorry for what I did. I was wrong,” is a perfectly acceptable way to start out. You cannot get an angry girl to forgive if you don’t apologize, so start off on the right foot by saying sorry first.  Don’t use a snarky or sarcastic tone. You don’t have to apologize if you think you were wronged, but don’t expect her to forgive you anytime soon. If your goal is to get her to forgive you, you’ll need to apologize even if you think you didn’t do anything wrong. “I’m really sorry,” and “I’m so sorry” sound better than, “Sorry,” which can come off as curt and dismissive. You aren’t going to be able to move forward until you accept that you were wrong, so don’t bother trying to bring up anything that she did. If you’re uncomfortable apologizing or owning up to your mistake, take a breath and keep your apology simple. Say, “I should have told you about the job before I told my friends. I screwed up,” or, “I know that it was wrong to not call you when I came home and I’m sorry.” She is more likely to move past your mistake if she knows that you feel bad about what you did. Feeling guilty is a sign that you know you did something wrong, and telling her that you understand why she’s upset will make it easier for her to try and let it go.  Say something like, “I shouldn't have blown you off the other night. I feel terrible.” Even if the two of you aren’t romantically involved, explain why your mistake was so bad and acknowledge your relationship. Say, “You’re my best friend, I don’t know why I would ignore your calls like that,” or “You’re my sister and I’d never be dishonest on purpose.” Start to wrap up your apology by vowing to never repeat the action that upset her again. Explain that you simply made a mistake and that you’ll never do it again.  Use the word “mistake” to talk about what you did. This makes it seem like you weren’t actively trying to hurt her. Don’t say “I’ll try to not do it again,” but, “I won’t do it again.” If you frame it like it’s outside of your control you’ll seem like you’re leaving the possibility open that you’ll do it again in the future. If you’re going to explain your mistake, say something like, “I won’t say something like that ever again. I thought I was telling a joke, but I see that it was dumb.” If you try to justify it you may only make things worse.",
      "The best way to figure out if she needs space or not is to simply ask her. Frame your question in a way that makes it seem like it’s okay if she needs some space by saying that you understand why she would want to be away from you. There’s nothing wrong with offering to give her some space, and she’ll decline your offer if she authentically wants to move on.  Say, “Do you need a couple of days away from me? If you do, it’s perfectly alright. We can revisit this topic when you’re feeling a little better.” A lot of people just need some time to cool down and relax. It doesn’t mean that she doesn’t want to be your friend or girlfriend anymore. If you upset her in the middle of an important conversation or intimate date, ask her if the two of you can try it again. This will show her that you’re making an honest attempt to repair the rift between the two of you while demonstrating that you’re willing to change. Say something like, “So I know I kind of screwed it up last time, but I’m ready to give it another shot if you are. Can we try that dinner date again?” or, “I don’t know why I got so jealous the first time, but I do want to hear about your vacation. I promise to not act like a fool this time.” Chocolates, flowers, and other small gifts can be an excellent way of showing her that you're ready to put in the effort to make it up to her. If you’re older or dating, a nice meal at her favorite restaurant can be a great way to sit down and work through any grievances in a positive setting.  If you don’t have any money, a handmade gift can be an excellent way to show her that you care about her. Present the gift as a sort of additional apology. Say, “I got you this. I felt really bad about what I did and when I saw this I thought of you.” If you spent a few days apart from one another, there may be some awkward vibes between the two of you—even if you got her a gift or apologized. Be straightforward and ask her how she’s feeling to see if she has any residual or negative feelings. Ask if she forgives you, and if she says she doesn’t, ask her what you can do to fix it.  Start with something like, “How are you feeling? I understand if you’re still upset.” If she says she’s fine, ask “Do you forgive me?” If she says that she doesn’t forgive you, say, “How can I make it up to you? What do I need to do to show you that I’m sorry?”",
      "Don’t get defensive and start fighting with every little point that she makes. Instead, sit quietly and calmly listen to her point of view. She may point out something that you did without realizing it, or tell you exactly how to fix the problem. Even if she doesn’t tell you something you didn’t already know, giving your friend or partner the space to speak is essential to a healthy relationship. If she gets really upset and starts to tear into you, give her a little time to work through some anger or sadness. It won’t do anyone any good if she just keeps it bottled up, and it will make her feel better. If she is in the middle of a long rant, just sit quietly and let her work through it. She may say some hurtful things while she’s venting. It’s okay to say, “I was hurt by what you said,” but under no condition should you interrupt her. Listen carefully when she speaks and try to consider things from her perspective. If you just take a second to listen to why she’s angry, you'll be able to better understand how to earn her forgiveness. It’s easy to get upset and thrown completely into a funk the moment that she says she’s upset. Try to fight this feeling. You’ll end up focusing on the wrong thing from the start. If she gets mad over a comment or joke, you may initially feel she is being irrational. If she said or did something that made you act out in the first place, you may think that she has no right be mad. Don’t follow the impulse to fight back or criticize her. There will be a time and place to discuss both perspectives, but in the heat of the moment, getting angry is just going to make her upset."

      "The \"vi\" part of this command selects the Vim text editor as the program to use. You'll replace \"filename\" with the name you wish to assign to your new file.  For a file named \"tamins\", for example, you'd type vi tamins.txt. If your current directory has a file by the same name, this command will instead open that file. This will create your new file and open it in the Vim editor. You should see a blank Terminal window with a tilde (~) on each line, as well as your text file's name at the bottom of the window. Doing so will place your document in \"Insert\" mode, wherein you can enter text as needed. You should see -- INSERT -- pop up at the bottom of the window when you press the I key. It's typically in the upper-left corner of your computer's keyboard. This key will stop the insert mode. This key will place Vim in \"Command\" mode. You should see a cursor appear at the bottom of the window. This command will save your document as it currently is. Doing so will quit out of Vim and return you to Terminal's main interface. Your text file is now in your specified directory.  You can check for the text file by typing ls into Terminal and pressing ↵ Enter and then looking for the file's name. You can also type :wq to save and quit in one command. Just as you did to create the file, you'll type vi filename.txt to open the file. This time when you open the file, you should see any saved changes that you made.",
      "You'll replace \"filename\" with your preferred text file name (e.g., \"sample\"). For example: when creating a file named \"kitty\", you'd type cat > kitty.txt. Doing so will create a new text file with the specified name in your current directory. Your cursor will appear on a blank line in Terminal. You can simply type as you typically would for any other text document. To save the current line of text and jump to the next line, you'll press ↵ Enter. If you have the text file's directory open, you can also simply double-click the text file when it appears to perform this step. This key command will save your work and return you to the Terminal command line, allowing you to continue entering commands. You'll replace \"filename\" with the text file's name. This command will locate your file, thus ensuring that it was safely created in your directory.  For example: to open a file named \"textfile\", you would type ls -l textfile.txt. The letters in this code are lowercase \"L\", not uppercase \"i\". Doing so should display the time, date, and name of your file on the following line, thus indicating that it was created and saved in your selected directory.",
      "To do so, click Menu, then find the Terminal app--which resembles a black box with a white \">_\" in it--and click on it. You'll typically find Terminal in a bar on the left side of the Menu window.  You can also click the search bar at the top of the Menu window and then type in terminal to search for it. Most Linux Distros open the Terminal as well, when pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. Terminal opens to your home directory, but the ls command displays every folder in your current directory. To create a text file in one of these directories, you'll need to change the current directory. Any directory name listed beneath the ls command (e.g., \"Desktop\") is a place to which you can navigate. You CAN create and edit files outside of this directory, but be aware that this may cause fatal problems. If you're sure about doing so, use the command ls / to see and navigate through the root directory, and prefix your commands with sudo when opening the text editor. More on that later. You'll replace \"directory\" with your preferred directory's name. This command changes Terminal's focus from the current directory to the one you name.  For example, you would type cd Desktop to shift Terminal's command location to the Desktop directory. If you want to create a text file in a specific folder within your selected directory, you'll place a \"/\" after the directory and then type in the folder's name. For example: for a folder named \"Misc\" in the Documents directory, you'd type cd Documents/Misc. Doing so will run your command, thereby shifting Terminal's target directory from your home directory to the one you specified. You can create a simple text file quickly, or you can use either Vim or Emacs to create and edit an advanced file. Now that you're in the directory in which you wish to place your text file, it's time to proceed with actually creating it.",
      "You'll replace \"filename\" with your preferred name for the text file. As long as your text file's name isn't a duplicate of an existing text file in your current directory, this command will open a new text file in the Emacs editor.  For example: a file named \"newfile\" would require you to type emacs newfile.txt. If you entered an existing text file name, this command will instead open the file in question. Emacs comes complete with tons of powerful commands that let you navigate around a document, look up related or help information, manipulate text, and understand your code. These commands fall into two types: Control commands and Meta commands.   Control commands are written like this: C-<letter>. To execute a Control command, you'll hold down the Ctrl key and press the specified letter key at the same time (e.g., Ctrl and A).  Meta (or Escape) commands are written like so: M-<letter> or ESC <letter>. The \"M\" refers to a computer's Alt key or Esc key, since not all computers have the Alt key. A command written like C-a b (or M-a b) will require you to hold Ctrl (or Alt or Esc) while pressing the first key (e.g., a, then release both keys and immediately press the second key (e.g., b). You can simply type as you typically would for any other text document. To save the current line of text and jump to the next line, you'll press ↵ Enter. Doing so will save your file. This will exit the Emacs text editor and return you to your directory in Terminal. Your text file should now be saved under your selected name in this directory. To do so, simply type emacs filename.txt into Terminal. As long as you're in the same directory as is the file, doing this will open your text file in Emacs, at which point you may resume editing it if you please."

      "Some background noise can help make your bird feel more comfortable while they are alone. You can leave on a nature documentary, classical music, or a talk radio show. Position their cage near an open window where they can look outside. Make sure to keep the blinds or curtains open. The conure may enjoy watching other birds or people wander by the window. Monitor the amount of heat and sunlight that the cage gets when near a window to prevent your conure from overheating while you are gone. Conures are generally social birds. They may enjoy hanging out around other conures and occasionally even other types of parrots. The birds can keep each other company while you are gone. Make sure to choose a bird that has a compatible personality with your conure.",
      "Good chew toys will keep your conure busy while sparing your furniture from their chewing. A conure should always have a few items to chew in their cage. Good chew toys include:  Wood blocks made out of balsa wood or pine Leather strips and ropes Vine balls Grass mats Wicker baskets Old books and newspapers Fruit and veggies (like carrots, celery, lettuce, and apples) Conures love playing with their feet. Try giving them a few toys that they can grip, turn, and kick. Wiffle balls, rattles, blocks with holes, and small wooden dumbbells are all great choices. Conures enjoy making noise. Try putting a bell inside of their cage that they can ring and shake. Rattling balls or key rings with jangling metal toys can also provide endless fun. Conures like foraging for food. Even if they’re happily fed, they will spend a long time hunting for hidden treats in their cage. Put sticks and branches with leaves in their enclosure and hide toys and treats among them to provide your bird with a natural environment to forage among. To keep them occupied, you can also hide treats and toys inside of:  Cereal boxes Rolled-up newspapers A drilled piece of wood Egg cartons Wreaths of grapevine or willow branches Finch nests Condiment cups filled with bird seed If your conure stops playing with their toys, it may be time to introduce new toys. Don’t throw out the old ones yet. Remove them from the cage until the conure grows tired of the new toys. You can then rotate in older toys. Your conure will play with the old toys as if they were new.  If your conure is not playing with a new toy after a day or two, take it out and try again another day. If the toy is dirty or sticky from use, it may be helpful to clean and freshen it up to make it attractive again to your conure.",
      "Conures will enjoy a chance to spread their wings and explore your home. They may even come hang out with you for a while. Give the conure at least an hour outside of their cage every day.  Always supervise your conure when they are out of their cage so they don’t get into trouble! Make sure to bird-proof your home before letting them roam. Close all windows, and turn off any fans. There should be no electrical wires or scented candles out in the open.  Always supervise your conure around other pets and children. If your other pets are aggressive toward small animals, put them in a separate room. Conures love a good bath every couple of days. Fill a tub with water, and place the bird in it. Once in the water, the conure will bathe themselves. If they don’t, splash the water to encourage them. When they are done, wrap them in a towel, and pat them dry gently.  You can use Tupperware containers or dog dishes to bathe your conure. The dish should be big enough that they can walk around comfortably in it.  If they don't want to bathe, take them out and try again another day. Going outside can be fun for your bird. To prevent them from flying off, however, they must be restrained. Place the conure in a harness, and let them ride on your shoulder while you hold onto their leash.  You can also carry them in a bird carrier.  If this is their first time outdoors, they may be nervous. Keep the first visit short. Even if their wings are clipped, a conure may still be able to escape outside. Always use a harness and leash or a bird carrier while outside. Spend time on a screened porch, if possible. This can help your conure get used to being outdoors and also provide them with fresh air without risking losing your bird. Just like children, conures love peekaboo. Hide your face behind a corner or an object. Let your conure come and find you. Pop out and say, “peekaboo!” Soon, your bird may be the one trying to hide. If your bird likes to toss items, catch can be a great game to play. Roll a plastic ball towards your bird. They may pick it up and toss it. Retrieve the ball, and roll it back to them. Keep playing until your bird gets bored. Depending on your bird’s size, balls you can use include ping pong balls, small caged pet toy balls, golf-ball-sized rope balls, and bird-sized Jolly Balls."

      "There are companies that provide transparent policies, inexpensive rates, and easy to use services that allow you to call Mexico from your cell phone or landline. Simply do an online search using terms like “buy credit to call Mexico”. Click on the option that makes the most sense for your needs. Once you do, sign up, download an app on your computer or smartphone, and buy credit for as little as $5. These services often have much more transparent policies and fees and cost less than calling cards. The majority of calling cards have unclear terms and fees. It is more affordable to use web-based calling like Google Voice or to buy phone credit through an online company, because the services are less costly and more transparent.  If you do have to use calling cards, use cards with lower cost per minute rates and an inexpensive connection fee unless you are going to be using all of your minutes in one phone call. Find cards that advertise specifically for Mexico. These cards can be less expensive than buying international calling cards. Buy your cards from stores that let you look at the card before you buy it. Check to see what the rates are and whether there are service fees. Compare cards and find the best deal for your needs. You can either call landlines or cell phones directly from Skype or Google Voice, or you can make calls while both of you are online. Go to Skype or Gmail and open up an account and download their app on your computer or your phone. Have the person you need to talk to do the same if you want to call for free.  Google Voice advertises rates of 5 cents per minute to Mexico. You can pay as you go from Skype for 1 cent a minute to landline phones and for 3.5 cents a minute to cell phones.

      "If this is your first time trying to critically analyze a text you should choose a book that isn’t too far outside of your comfort zone. It is easier for you to think deeply about a book that you are not struggling to read.   Pick a book from a genre you already like or one written in a time and a place with which you are familiar. If you can, choose a book by an author you already know and like. Consult an expert. There are professionals and amateurs alike who would love to match you with a work of great literature. These include:  Librarians: high school, university, or your local public library Literary teachers: your high school English teacher Literary enthusiasts: your school might have a book club Book sellers: Amazon.com can offer recommendations, but also your local independent book store. The media: The New York Times Bestseller's List, NPR, Oprah's Book Club List Before you begin reading, it often helps to have some idea of what you will encounter within the book’s pages. Learn some background on the author of the book. Find out what other works they wrote and how their writing fits into conversation with the other literature of the era.   You can also find useful context and helpful guidance in book reviews online. This step can help you formulate questions that you’d like to answer as you read the book. Before you read, jot down a series of basic questions and keep track of your answers. You can keep a separate notebook for your answers or you can mark your book copy in the margins with a pencil. Consider the following questions:  Who is the book about? What happens to the main characters in the story? Where and when does the book take place? How does the author tell this story? Is it written from one perspective, or several? Is it told by an omniscient (or all-knowing) narrator? Or is it told by the characters themselves? You may encounter difficulty with your work, and you do not necessarily have to go it alone. There are many guides available that can offer summaries, character profiles, commentary, and more.

      "The protagonists are the heroes of the book, and the antagonists are their rivals. A famous example is Sherlock Holmes, the protagonist and his antagonist, Professor Moriarty. These may be the most important characters, but even minor supporting characters can help reveal important details about the actions of the main character. Watson, for example, is a key side character who helps the author convey important information about Sherlock’s character traits, personality, strengths, and weaknesses.  Learn the relationships between characters as well as the character names, since names are occasionally symbolic. Note if and how the characters change over the course of the book. Point of view is about answering the question, “Whose voice tells this story?” It is important because you will only be able to read what the narrator of the story knows and tells you. It could be that of a third-person narrator who is outside of the story or it could be the first-person voice of the main character.  If the perspective is third person, determine if it is omniscient (all-knowing) or limited (there are things the narrator does not seem to know). Identifying the perspective can also serve as a springboard for studying the narrator. For example, does the narrator seem trustworthy or unreliable? Is there anything the narrator doesn’t seem to know? Answering these questions for yourself can help you to delve deeper into the text. Second-person voice is rare in fictional literature. It uses the pronoun “you.” On example is the 2017 book Montpelier Parade by Karl Geary in which the adult writer speaks to a youthful self. There are five parts to a plot, or storyline, including: exposition (beginning), rising action (things start to happen), climax (the crisis comes to a head), falling action (the consequences of the climax) and resolution (ending). For example, in Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games (2008), the plot follows 16-year old Katniss, who lives in a dystopian future land that used to be America, through her selection and preparation for the games. The crisis occurs when Katniss decides that she and her friend, Peeta, will not turn against one another, thus undermining the rules of the games and challenging the social and political order. The aftermath shows us how the repercussions play out, and the resolution is left open-ended, as Collins wrote the book as the first in a series. To focus your attention on the plot, ask yourself “what happens in this story?” The setting of a story includes both the place and time in which it takes place. Pay attention to the author’s descriptions of sights, sounds, smells, colors, etc. These rich descriptions are key. Often the setting itself can end up acting almost like a character, impacting the plot and shaping the main character’s struggles.  One classic example of this is Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). The Mississippi River is a key component to Huck’s adventures and the story could not take place without it. Reflect on when and where the book was written. Think about who the author was and what position they held in society at the time. What voice and perspective did the author bring to their work? What is the significance of these details for the characters and the plot in the book? When Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852), she was commenting on the crisis of slavery in the U.S. from an abolitionist perspective at the time. Thinking about the context in which the book was imagined and written can help you understand why the author might have made certain choices in their work.",
      "Literary critics argue that there are a limited number of plot archetypes, or forms, that you can use to describe most plots. Even if you think your book does not conform to one of these, you can draw upon these descriptions to think about how the storyline develops. They include:  A rags to riches plot is one in which the protagonist’s fortune improves steadily, ending on a high note. A riches to rags storyline is one in which the main character’s fortune changes from good to bad. An Icarus storyline is characterized by a rise in the protagonist’s fortune, followed by a fall. In an Oedipus plot, the main character experiences a fall, a rise, and then a second fall. In a Cinderella plot, the protagonist goes through a rise, followed by a fall, and then rises again in the end. The man in a hole storyline follows the main character as they experience a fall first, and then a rise. Tone is the mood or attitude that the author conveys through their writing. The tone may be solemn, suspenseful, humorous, or sarcastic, among others. J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye (1951) takes a sarcastic tone in this coming-of-age story. Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird (1960) conveys a solemn tone as it deals with troubling social issues. Certain tones tend to go with certain genres of writing. Thrillers, for example, cultivate a tone of suspense and fear as a matter of course. How the author describes scenes in the story are important for conveying the tone, mood, and other underlying messages. These details are the author’s way of putting the reader in the character’s shoes, but they can also carry deeper meanings. For example, in describing Harry's bedroom under the stairs, J. K. Rowling tells her readers in book 1 of the Harry Potter series that spiders were Harry’s constant companions. This description not only gives the reader a window into what Harry’s life has been like, it also foreshadows his encounters with spiders later on, in book two. Watch for small details, images, or phrases that continually come up over the course of the book. This type of repetition is also known as a motif, and it can give you clues about the tone and theme of the text. For example, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five includes repetition of the phrase “so it goes.” Look for metaphors, like “time is an arrow,” or similes “my dream has dried up like a raisin in the sun.” Allegory is a form of storytelling in which the entire story is a metaphor for something else entirely. L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1990), for example, is often read as a political allegory in about 19th century farmers in the American west who had been hurt by the decision to tie U.S. currency to the gold standard, rather than silver. Clues to this reading are buried in the novel’s language, as the Dorothy wears silver shoes (the ruby slippers were an addition in the film version) and “Oz” is the abbreviation for ounce, oz., the unit of measurement for gold and silver. Authors often use words in ways that have more than one meaning, look for hints by circling recurring words, names, phrases, metaphors an similes to see if a larger pattern emerges. A symbol is any story element that stands for an abstract idea. Such an element can be an object, a place, a character, or any other concrete or tangible expression. Seasons, for example, are common symbols used to represent the passing of one's life, with spring indicating childhood and coming of age, summer representing the prime of one's life, autumn indicating maturity and growing old, and winter representing the process of dying.  Look for recurring mentions of something throughout the book to help you identify symbols. Pay attention to elaborate descriptions, these may flag that the author is using a symbol. Reflect on what these symbols, together, might mean in the context of the book’s larger purpose. A theme is a fundamental idea addressed in a work of literature. This is the deepest layer of the work and its meaning. Themes are usually topics explored and fleshed out throughout multiple works of literature written by multiple writers, giving the theme universal appeal. The idea that humans are either essentially good or essentially evil, for example, is a theme explored by many authors at different places and times. William Golding’s 1954 novel, The Lord of the Flies conveys the idea that, if left to its own devices, humanity would devolve into violence and chaos.  By identifying the theme of the book, you can arrive at the fundamental point the author set out to make in writing the story. Reflect on whether you agree with the author’s take on the theme or not. After all, you can appreciate good literature without agreeing with it!"

      "Start the exercise by lying down, extending your legs, and pointing your toes upward to form a straight line with your body. Relax your shoulders and neck and find a comfortable position. Use a yoga mat, a towel, or work on a carpeted or padded floor to make the exercise more comfortable. Interlace or stack your fingers and place them behind your neck to help support your head during the exercise. Your hands should rest comfortably behind your neck and shouldn’t pull on your head.  Don’t round your neck and spine. If you have shoulder flexibility or mobility issues, you can place your fingertips on the sides of your head. Keep your legs together and extend them so they’re straight. You can bend your knees slightly if your flexibility doesn’t allow you to keep them straight, but work to straighten your legs out over time.  Try doing yoga to stretch your hamstrings to improve the flexibility of your legs. You can cross your ankles if it makes it more comfortable for you. Once you’re in a good position with your legs elevated, take a breath and brace your core for the movement by contracting and keeping it tight. Keep your back fully connected to the ground. There should not be any space between your lower back and the ground.",
      "To really challenge yourself with a difficult routine, do 3 sets of 15 vertical leg crunches, with a brief pause in between sets to keep your muscles working. The shorter the rest period in between sets, the more difficult of a challenge the workout is for your core.  Add other abdominal exercises to this routine to make the workout even more intense.  Use good technique throughout the whole workout; don’t let your form break down as you get tired. Take a rest if you need to, then return to the movement using good technique. Instead of supporting your head with your hands, extend your arms and reach toward your toes when you perform the crunch. Reach as far as you can and hold at the top of the movement for 2 seconds before you slowly lower back down to the ground. Reach as far as you can without rounding your shoulders and upper back. To really ramp up the difficulty of the vertical leg crunch, hold a rounded weight plate against your chest or behind your head when you perform the movement. Use good form and hold at the top of the movement for 2 seconds before you lower back down with control.",
      "Engage your abdominal muscles to raise your upper body off of the ground, stretching toward your feet. Imagine lifting your chest to the sky so you don’t round your shoulders and spine. Exhale as you contract your abdominal muscles and raise your shoulders. Stop moving upwards when you feel your shoulders start to hunch forward, and hold the crunch for 2 seconds to fully engage your core. Keep your elevated and be careful not to pull on your neck or extend your chin to avoid straining your neck. Keep your legs straight and pointed upward and keep them from moving while you hold the crunch. After 2 seconds, slowly return back down to the starting position with control, keeping your abdominal muscles contracted. Imagine lowering back down one vertebra at a time in a smooth and fluid motion.  Try to keep your legs from moving or swaying while you lower your shoulders back to the ground. Do not slam on the ground or fall backward or you could injure yourself. Keep your legs elevated in the starting position after you’ve lowered back down to the grown. To get a good abdominal workout using vertical leg crunches, you need to do at least 12 reps. Remember to exhale as you crunch and take a breath when you return to the starting position. It’s okay to take a break and lower your legs before finishing up your reps."

      "If you pick something that you're passionate about, then your audience will be able to see and feel your passion. This will also make you much more excited to generate ideas for the speech and to deliver the speech. If you only have a limited amount of options and can't pick anything you're truly passionate about, you should at least pick something that you like or are interested in to make it easier and more enjoyable for you to write and deliver the speech. If you're giving a speech at a professional conference, then it's logical that you would pick a topic that you're an expert on so you can give credibility to your speech. But even if you're not delivering a speech in a professional setting or on a particularly complicated topic, you should still pick something you know a lot about, whether it's baseball or your neighborhood. You can even start by making a list of the things you're knowledgeable about, whether it's your family, career, politics, gardening, pets, or travel.  You don't have to know every single thing about a topic to deliver a great speech. You can pick something that you're knowledgeable about, and can supplement that job with some careful research. If you're picking a subject you're knowledgeable about but know you'll need to research further, make sure the topic is easy to research. If you pick something fairly obscure, then it may be difficult to find more information about it. It could have to do with literature, movies, sports, foreign languages, or even gender relations. Whatever it is, you may even be able to find a theme that carries through a variety of categories, such as \"loss of innocence.\" Make a list of all of your hobbies and interests and see what would make for an engaging speech topic. You may find a large overlap between the things you're interested in and the things you know. If there has been a topic that has been in the news again and again, you can use it as an occasion for a speech. It may be something controversial like gay marriage or gun control, but if the occasion is appropriate, you can give a speech about this current event, offering a nuanced perspective of the situation.  Read through popular national and local papers, listen to the radio, and watch the news to see what people are talking about and how the public is reacting to these events. You can also pick something that is particularly timely for your community. If there has been controversy over a new policy regarding public schools in your neighborhood, you could use it as an occasion for a speech. You can pick something that is timely for your audience. If you're addressing high school seniors, you can talk about the next stage of life after graduation, and can bring in any relevant current information from the news. If the occasion calls for it, you can give a speech about something personal in your life. It could relate to your experiences with your parents, siblings, or friends, to a personal struggle, or a formative episode in your life. Just make sure the information isn't so personal that it makes the audience uncomfortable, or that the subject is so close to you that you can't talk about it without getting emotional. Remember that you can add personal information to a topic that doesn't feel so personal; you can discuss an aspect of your career, for example, while throwing in a personal anecdote. You should be able to deliver a speech about the topic with clarity and conviction. This means that you should feel strongly enough about the topic to inform, persuade, or entertain your audience. It also means that your audience should trust you as an authority on the subject; if you're an only child, you should avoid giving a speech on the importance of having a sibling; if you haven't entered college yet, it may be difficult for you to give a speech on the importance of choosing a major. Whatever the topic, you should be able to connect with your audience through the speech. At the end or even during the speech, a little light bulb should go off in your audience's heads, and they should reach a new understanding of your topic. If you don't have the ability to truly connect with your audience about this topic, then pick another one.",
      "If you want to connect to your audience, then you should consider its knowledge before you select a topic. If you're giving a speech to a group of aspiring writers, then you can comfortably reference other writers and literary terms; if you're speaking to a group that knows very little about writing, be careful when you make more obscure literary references. If you're speaking to a group that is knowledgeable about a topic, then you don't have to waste their time by discussing the most basic aspects of that topic. If you're speaking at a conference for young professionals, you can use more complicated terms and elaborate phrases, but if you're delivering a speech to middle school students, you'll have to change your terms and phrasing to connect to your audience. You don't want to lose your audience by speaking about something that is completely over their heads, or by delivering content in such a basic way that it sounds condescending. What would your audience need to know, and what would interest your audience? Put yourself in your audience's shoes and make a list of all of the things the audience would care about; an audience of teenagers would care about very different things from an audience of middle-aged adults. Imagine yourself as one of the audience members. If they're teenagers, pretend you're a teenager. Try seeing your topic choice from their perspective. If it bores or overwhelms you, then it won't be the right choice. Knowing the age, gender, and race of the members in your audience can help influence your topic. If most of your audience is over the age of 65, then you probably wouldn't talk about current fashion trends on the runway; if most of your audience is under the age of 20, then you wouldn't talk about saving for retirement.  If there are many more males than females in your audience, for example, then it may be best to pick a gender neutral or male-geared topic. Knowing the race of your audience can help pick a topic. If you have a diverse audience, then something about race relations or diversity can interest your audience, but if you're talking about diversity, interracial marriage, or discrimination against one specific race of people that is not in the audience to an audience that is predominantly of one race, then your discussion may fall flat. You should also consider where your audience is from. A certain topic may be more interesting to a person from California than a person from Idaho and vice versa. If you're giving a speech to friends or family, then you can be more personal than you would if you were giving a speech to an audience of strangers. If you're giving a speech to your employees, your tone would be different than it would be if you were giving a speech to your superiors. Adjust the tone and content of your speech accordingly.",
      "The occasion for the speech can go a long way in helping you determine the topic. Your speech topic will vary depending on whether the occasion is celebratory, just plain fun, solemn, or professional. Here are a few ways that the occasion can help influence your speech topic:  If the occasion is solemn, such as a funeral or memorial service, then your topic should be serious and relevant to the occasion. If the occasion is fun, such as a toast at a bachelor party, then it's time to bring out the fun anecdotes and stories and to make people laugh -- not to share your passion for coin collecting. If the occasion is celebratory, like a wedding, then you need to provide some light-hearted humor as well as some serious and sentimental points. If the occasion is professional, then you need to stick to a professional topic, such as website design, and not focus on your personal experiences. Your purpose is related to the occasion and is the goal you want to achieve through your speech. Your purpose can be to inform, persuade, or just to entertain your audience. A speech can have a variety of purposes, but it's important to be acquainted with the most common purposes:    To inform. To inform your audience, you'll need to provide relevant facts and details about a subject that reveals information that allows your audience to see an ordinary subject in a more complicated light, or to learn about a completely foreign subject. To persuade. To persuade your audience, you'll need to use rhetorical techniques, metaphors, and convincing evidence from experts to show them that they should do something, whether it's to elect you for office, recycle more, or take the time to volunteer in their communities. To entertain. To entertain your audience, you'll need to draw on personal or anecdotal examples, tell funny stories, show off your wit, and make your audience crack up, even if you're communicating an underlying serious message. To celebrate. If you're celebrating a specific person or event, you'll need to show your audience what makes that person or thing so special, and to garner enthusiasm for your subject. If you want to select a topic that suits your purpose and is relevant to the occasion, then you should eliminate a variety of topics before you even start brainstorming ideas. This will make it easier for you not to offend or just bore your audience as you move forward with your ideas. Here are a few things to consider as you cross those potential topics off your list:  Don't pick anything so complicated that it would be impossible to inform your audience. If you pick something so complex that it can't be explained in a short amount of time or without pages of charts or diagrams, then you will lose your audience. Don't pick something that's so simple that your audience could understand it in just a minute or two. If your topic is so basic that you'll only be repeating yourself after you've said just a few sentences, then you'll lose your audience's interests as well. You want to keep your audience members on their toes, not knowing what to expect next. Don't pick anything that's too controversial. Unless you're at a convention for controversial speeches, it's best to avoid topics that are too controversial, like abortion or gun control. Of course, if your goal is to persuade your audience to agree with one side of these issues, then you should go ahead with your speech, but know that you may lose many people before you begin. Don't pick anything that doesn't fit the mood of the audience. If it's a celebratory occasion, don't give a dry speech about irrigation; if it's a professional occasion, don't give an emotional speech about how much you love your mother."

      "Katy recently came out with her InstaGlam Makeup Collection by Covergirl. With several shades of foundation, concealer, lip color, and nail polish, there is bound to be something that suits your skin. Especially when choosing a foundation, pick a shade that makes your skin light and young, just like Katy’s makeup. Katy’s famous eyebrows are strong and full. Whether or not that look is for you, your brows still need to be on point. Using tweezers, gently remove any stray hairs. When you’re content with the shape, use an eyebrow pencil (for beginners) to gently stroke outwards into the shape of your brows. Use short strokes to keep a natural look. This will keep them looking full and soft yet defined.  If you are a novice or expert, try using an angled brush with a powder instead of an eyebrow pencil. This gives you more control and allows you to better shape your brows.  If you’re having trouble seeing your brow shape, try gently brushing your eyebrows directly upwards. This will help bring out their natural shape and allow you to fill them in easier. It’s no secret that Katy has thick and wild eyelashes. To help define your lashes, apply your mascara in small back-and-forth motions across the eye, while spinning the brush up and out. This helps coat your eyelashes evenly. Continue this all the way to the tips of your lashes for added length.  If your lashes are particularly thin, angle the mascara brush upwards and apply your mascara. This helps apply a larger coat of mascara while keeping your lashes from clumping.  Still not enough? Dust baby powder with a brush onto your lashes and then apply mascara. The microscopic flakes of powder will add dimension and thickness to your natural lashes. Katy often wears toned down eye makeup and big eyelashes finished with a bold lip. Experiment with greens, blues, reds, purples, and yellows. If you feel unsure about such bold colors, initially try a soft pink or coral lip. Remember, there are no rules to lip color. Another option is to try a colored gloss or stain instead of a lip stick. Gloss will often be less bold while a stain is great for lasting throughout the entire day.  To maximize lip color, blend concealer onto your lips before applying lipstick. This gives your lipstick boldness and prevents it from bleeding off of your lips.  Another option for staying-power and boldness is dust a layer of translucent powder atop your lips in between application. This keeps the lipstick from sliding around and retains the color.",
      "Katy is notorious for changing her hair color and style but eventually, she always returns to her comfort colour, black. If black is too dark for your skin tone, try a dark or medium brown. Keep highlights to a minimum and use gloss to maintain shine. If you feel comfortable, try cutting some bangs into your hair. Katy often has straight-across bangs. If this feels too bold for you, try side swept bangs instead, which can be easily blended into the rest of your hair. Since Katy is always changing her hair color, you may want to experiment too. However, constantly bleaching and coloring your hair is expensive and may cause some major damage. Pull a “Katy” and wear a wig instead. A wig can be a fun way to have colored hair for a day or even a week, without damaging your natural hair. Know what your wig is made of. You cannot use heat styling tools on a synthetic wig without damaging it. You may also not be able to use hair products on synthetic hair making it difficult to manipulate or blend to your natural hair. While Katy sometimes uses a single color, she often adds length, colored stripes or other textures to her hair. Again, constant coloring and bleaching can really damage your natural hair. Purchase some inexpensive clip-in extensions for a fast way to change your look.  Be creative and experiment with bold colors, feathers, or lengthening extensions.",
      "Katy is always pairing different textures and fabrics together. Emulate her style by incorporating sparkly leggings and a leather dress with patent shoes. The varied textures allows your outfit to become multi-dimensional. Add texture by wearing nylons with your shorts or skirt instead of leggings. Nylons are an inexpensive way to add variety to your outfits. If you’re a heel person, stick to platforms. Katy loves platform shoes and they not only make a bold statement but are often more comfortable than regular footwear.. If you feel heels are too old for you or just aren’t your style, watch for flats in bright colors or wacky accents such as pictures or feathers. Don’t limit yourself to ballet flats. Watch for sandals, slip ons, or slippers. Katy Perry is often seen in a pin-up, retro style. Visit your local second hand stores and look for lace, A-line waists and puffy skirts. If it looks glam or over the top, it works. Are you less girly? Don’t worry. Retro doesn’t have to mean lace and fluff. Think about high waisted pants or jeans if you’re style favors low maintenance. Another option is khaki green, military-style pants paired with a bold lip. Katy is often seen in either retro or geeky frames. Depending on your daily outfit, try adding some glasses to finish off your look. If you’re going retro, look for white or bold colored glasses in a cat eye shape. When wearing a nerdy look, pick some square and plastic frames in a black or brown color."

      "Sharing a difficult experience or task with a friend or partner will make the whole experience more tolerable, even enjoyable. Enlisting a friend to help you in your endeavor to stop swearing can work in one of two ways:  You can either rope in a friend who also has a swearing problem and work towards cutting out the bad language together, or you can ask a clean-mouthed comrade to monitor your language and give you a gentle reminder whenever you slip up. Either way, having someone to hold you accountable for your swearing slip-ups will force you to stick to your guns and kick this bad habit once and for all. Everyone has their own individual triggers which set them off, leading to the intense desire to swear. For some people it's traffic, for others it's the queue at the grocery store and for others still, it's when yet another character dies on \"Game of Thrones\". If you can pinpoint what your exact triggers are, you may be able to avoid them - by leaving work 30 minutes later to avoid rush hour, by shopping online, or by watching reruns of \"Friends\" instead. Remove yourself from any situations which cause negative emotions to rise and you'll be better able to control what comes out of your mouth. The swear jar is a tried-and-tested method which has helped many people to kick their swearing habit. It usually involves taking a large jar or money box (something you can't easily break into) to which you will add a dollar (or some other arbitrary amount of money) every time you utter a swear word. You can view the swear jar in two ways, as a punishment or as a delayed reward:  It's a punishment because you have to say goodbye to a dollar every time you slip up. But it's also a reward, because once the jar is full (or you've successfully stopped swearing - whichever comes first) you get to spend the money on whatever you like - whether you want to buy yourself some new threads, or donate the money to charity. Keeping the swear jar in your office is a good idea if you have roped several people into giving up swearing. Everyone will hold each other accountable and make sure that nobody tries to sneakily avoid sacrificing their dollar. Once the jar is full, you can celebrate by buying a new coffee machine for your entire floor. This method is the human equivalent of putting an electric shock collar on a dog to eliminate bad behaviors - unsavory but effective. Basically, all you need to do is wear a rubber band or a hair tie around your wrist and give it a firm snap every time you catch yourself swearing.  The thinking behind this is that your brain will come to associate swearing with pain and, over time, will cause you to mentally shy away from using bad words. If you're really serious about this method, you could give permission to a friend (preferably one prone to a little schadenfreude) to snap the band for you. Just try to remember that you agreed to it. Another way to train yourself to bite your tongue whenever you feel a swear word coming on is to imagine that someone is listening. All the time. It could be your grandmother, your boss or your innocent little son or daughter, just as long as it's someone you'd be ashamed to swear in front of. Whenever you swear, visualize them standing beside you with a shocked or horrified expression on their face. That should help deter you. Many people's swearing habits, especially those of teenagers, are influenced by the explicit content of much of their favorite music, movies or T.V. shows. If you feel like this is the case, and you're swearing to sound like your favorite rapper, you may need a reality check to remind yourself that this is not how people speak in the real world. Try switching your radio station to squeaky-clean pop music, or at least download the clean versions of your favorite songs instead.",
      "An isolated swear word here and there can be forgiven - but if you find yourself swearing constantly, unable to go more than a sentence or two without throwing in an expletive, that's when you know you have a problem. The first step in training yourself to stop swearing is to become aware of when you do it.  Do you only curse around certain people or in specific situations? Is there a particular swear word that you use all the time? Try to identify why you curse and the role that swear words play in your speech patterns.  Once you begin paying attention to your swearing habits, you may be shocked by how much you rely on swearing to express yourself. Don't be too dismayed by it though, recognizing how often you curse is the first step towards fixing the problem. Once you start paying attention to your own cursing habits, you will start to pick up on other people's, without even realizing it. This is also a good thing, as you will realize how unpleasant swearing sounds and what a negative impression it gives off. Once you have identified your major swearing habits, you can set about eliminating swear words from your casual speech. This is when you curse for no real reason - you're not angry, it didn't just slip out - you are just using the curse word as a figure of speech. You can correct this problem by replacing the curse word with a harmless substitute, perhaps something beginning with the same letter or with a similar sound, which doesn't cause offense.  For example, try replacing \"sh**\" with \"sugar\", \"turd\", \"shoot\" or \"sheep\" or \"f***\" with \"duck\", or \"fudge\". You'll feel silly saying these words at first, but you'll get used to it after a while. Using such meaningless words may even eliminate your need to express yourself negatively at all. Even if you slip up and say the forbidden curse word, follow it immediately with your chosen alternative. Over time, your brain will come to associate the two and you will be able to actively choose one over the other. . Swear words are often used \"for want of a better word.\" The problem with this excuse is that there are plenty of better words out there, any of which will allow you to express yourself much more eloquently and succinctly than a curse word ever will. By expanding your vocabulary and replacing your most commonly used swear words with an array of alternative options, you will come across as being more intelligent, pleasant and laid-back than ever before.  Make a list of your favorite swear words, then use a dictionary or thesaurus to come up with a range of alternative options. For example, instead of using the word \"B.S.\" morning, noon and night, try replacing it with infinitely more descriptive and humorous words such as balderdash, hogwash, drivel and baloney. You can also expand your vocabulary by reading more books and newspapers. Jot down any descriptive words that tickle your fancy and make an effort to use them in a sentence. Also make an effort to really listen to other people and make a mental note of the words and phrases that they use to express themselves, rather than resorting to swearing.",
      "Swearing is used in a lot of different contexts - you might swear when you are angry or frustrated, when you are trying to emphasize a point or when you are trying to be funny. Swearing is an unpleasant habit for a variety of reasons. It gives the impression of stupidity or a lack of education, even if this is not the case. It can be intimidating or viewed as a form of bullying if directed at another person. It can also be extremely offensive or off-putting to listeners, thus limiting your job prospects or ruining your potential for romantic engagements.  Your swearing habit may have developed as a child, if you were exposed to bad language in your family home. Or it might have started as a teenager, when you used curse words to look cool in front of your friends. Whatever the reason, there's no point in looking back and blaming people. The most important thing is that you recognize that you have a problem and commit to working through it. . Positive thinking is essential to giving up swearing. This is because people are generally much more inclined to swear when they are complaining about something, in a bad mood or just being negative in general. By thinking positively, you are removing the need to swear altogether. Admittedly, learning how to think positively can be difficult. If you find yourself leaning towards negative thoughts or emotions; just stop, take a deep breath, and ask yourself \"does it really matter?\"  For example, ask yourself \"does it really matter if I'm a few minutes late for my meeting?\" or \"does it really matter if I can't find the remote control and have to switch the channels on the television set instead?\" Putting a situation into the right perspective can help you to calm down and overcome negative emotions. In addition, you will need to think positively about your ability to stop swearing. If you have a negative outlook and have doubts about your ability to succeed, you are setting yourself up for failure from the get-go. Remind yourself that if people can give up smoking or lose hundreds of pounds of weight through dieting, you will definitely be able to give up swearing! Swearing is habit that you've probably picked up over a number of years and which you've come to rely on as part of your daily speech. Like any ingrained habit, it will be impossible to stop doing it overnight. Training yourself to stop swearing is a process, you'll have good days and bad days, but it's important to keep at it. Remind yourself why you're doing it and visualize how good you'll feel when you've finally kicked the habit.  Really think about why you want to stop swearing. Maybe you're afraid of giving off the wrong impression at a new job or you don't want to set a bad example for your kids. Use this as motivation to keep trying. Whatever you do, don't give up. Exercise your self-control and remind yourself that you can do anything you set your mind to!"

      "A key component in being an independent woman is being confident with who you are. Part of that entails being true to yourself. Don't try to be a mirror image of other women. Figure out your own strengths and interests and focus on those.  Don't fall victim to bad fashion trends. Looking your best will help you feel your best. Dress in a style that is flattering and makes you feel comfortable and confident. Avoid the pressure to conform to your gender. Many women feel certain pressures to look and act in certain ways simply because they are female, but you don't have to if you don't do or be anything considered \"feminine\" if you don't wan to. You do not have to wear make-up or dress a certain way. Likewise, you do not have to like stereotypical female activities such as shopping or romantic movies. Maybe there is a specific fear that keeps you from being independent. Perhaps you are nervous about living alone or have general anxiety issues. You are not alone, and there are steps you can take to overcome your fears.  Try exposure therapy. Exposing yourself to your fears in small doses has proven very effective. For example, if you suffer anxiety when meeting new people, ask a friend to go with you to a new social event. Gradually work up the nerve to attend by yourself. Seek professional help. If your anxieties are keeping you from becoming independent or achieving another goal, try seeing a mental health professional. Counseling can help reduce anxiety. Being independent means being in control of your choices, but it doesn't mean you can't rely on others. Women form strong bonds with friends and family members. Don't be afraid to ask for and accept help when you need it. Be specific when asking for help. Be honest about what you need, and allow someone give you assistance. A positive attitude will help you come across to others as a confident woman. It will also help you feel good about yourself, and give you the strength you need to be independent. Avoid negative thoughts. Instead, take time to compliment yourself each day. You are the only one who can truly change your life. Acknowledge that you are responsible for your own choices. Once you realize that you are in control, you will feel more confident. This will lead to increased independence.",
      "Being independent means being in charge of your own life and making your own decisions. In order to do that successfully, you need to understand who you really are. Knowing and loving yourself is the first step towards being capable of independence.  Pay attention to your moods. Your emotions are important factors in how you make decisions, so monitor them. Be aware of what makes you happy and what is unsatisfying.  Know how your environment affects you. Notice how you react in different settings or situations. Making important decisions on your own is a key component of being an independent woman. In order to feel confident doing this, use careful consideration when making big choices. Remember, the best way to make a big decision is to balance what your heart wants with what your mind thinks is best.  Make a list of the risks and rewards involved. When examining the list of all potential rewards against the risks, decide if the odds are in your favor or against you. Don't be afraid to ask for advice. You're still the one making the decision, even if you listen to input from someone you trust. Consider how you would feel if your decision were broadcast on the nightly news. Is this a decision you would be proud of?  Does the decision compromise your values, character, or integrity? You may have to make an unpopular decision, but do what you feel is right an in line with these things. Being an independent woman means being able to care for yourself emotionally. Learn to acknowledge your emotions. Be kind to yourself during times of stress or unhappiness. You deserve your own patience.  This will be different for everyone, so find something small that you can do to calm yourself if you need to. If you're at work, try stepping back and taking a minute for yourself. Go to the restroom and splash some cool water on your face. Or log out of your e-mail for a minute and text a friend. Pets are great for helping you soothe yourself. If you have a cat, pet him. This will help you deal with your stress. Learning to enjoy your own company is a big part of being independent. You don't always have to depend on others in order to enjoy an activity. To get used to your own company, practice spending time by yourself – on purpose.  Go to a movie by yourself. You won't have to worry about anyone talking during the previews or hogging the popcorn. Dine alone. Going to a restaurant by yourself can be intimidating. But you might find that it is very enjoyable. You get to choose the time and place, without having to worry about another person's appetite. If you fear you might be bored, take a book or magazine with you. Being in a codependent relationship can greatly detract from your ability to be independent. Evaluate all of your relationships (personal, romantic, professional) and make sure that there is a give and take in each relationship. Make sure your needs are being met in each of your relationships.  Try being more assertive in your relationships. Speak up if you feel that you are not being valued. Try to make more time for yourself and do some of the things you love, even when your partner has no interest in those things. This will allow you to balance being independent in your relationship with the time spent together.",
      ". Financial independence is an important part of being an independent woman. The first step to successfully manage your money is to figure out how much you are spending each month. Keep track of your spending for at least two months to get a clear idea of your output.  Keep track of minor expenses as well as major ones. Chart how much you spend on rent, credit card payments, food, and transportation. You'll also want to note how much you spend on entertainment and socializing. Try using an app or an online banking system to make tracking your finances easy and accurate. Figure out why it is so important to you to become independent. Do you want to own your own home? Be secure as you head into retirement? Write down whatever your financial priorities are. Visualizing your motivation will help you find the enthusiasm to start a steady financial regimen. Allocate yourself a certain amount of money to spend in each area of your life. For example, factor it in if you know you like to see a movie once a week. Figure out a comfortable amount of money to both spend and save each week or month. Build some flexibility into your budget. This way you won't find yourself completely derailed if gas prices go up or your cat needs to make a trip to the vet. In order to be truly financially independent, you need to do some research and planning. Learn about investment and savings opportunities. If you feel it would help, seek the help of a professional financial planner or advisor. Women typically make less money than men for doing the same job. Evaluate your professional value and determine whether it is an appropriate time to ask for a raise. There is a good chance you deserve one.  Make a plan. Schedule a meeting with your boss to discuss your career goals and compensation. Be very clear about what you are asking for. Be open to negotiations.  Remain calm and confident during the meeting."

    ],
    "document": [
      "Choose a spot that is near a window, but not exposed to direct sunlight. Be sure to set the tank on a very sturdy surface so that it isn't likely to topple. Finally, if you have other pets, you may want to consider placing the betta in a room they don't have access to.  You may want to get an aquarium stand designed to hold the weight of the tank you have chosen. Allow five inches between the aquarium and the wall to accommodate the filter and heater. Different types of filters require different installation methods. Check the manufacturer's instructions for the filter you purchased and make sure it is installed properly.  If you have an external power filter, set it up on the back of the tank. Your tank lid may have come with a cut-out to make installation easier. Wait until the tank is filled with water before turning it on. If you have an undergravel filter, put the filter plate in first and make sure the tubes are correctly fitted. Don't turn it on until the tank has been filled with water. Rinse it thoroughly under cool running water (no soap!) to remove all traces of dust, which can clog the filter and cause the water to be cloudy. Pile one to three inches of substrate into the tank. Slope it gently toward the back of the tank. Place a clean plate on top of the gravel and begin pouring water on top of the plate to fill the tank. The plate will prevent you from displacing the substrate as you pour the water. Continue until the tank is one-third full.  As you add water, check the tank for leaks. If you see a leak, it's important to repair it before you finish filling and stocking the tank. Remove the plate when you're finished adding water. For live plants, make sure the roots are properly buried beneath the surface of the substrate. Arrange the plants so that the taller plants are in the back of the tank and the shorter plants are near the front. This will give you a better view of your betta.  Make sure all decorations are properly anchored in the gravel, so they won't come loose. After you finish filling your tank, it's best not to put your hands in the water again, so make sure you like the positioning of your plants and decorations. Fill the tank within an inch of the top with water, then plug in the filter and turn it on to make sure it works properly. Check to make sure the water is circulating, gently, smoothly and quietly. Adjust the settings if it seems to be moving too powerfully. Most heaters attach to the inside of the tank with suction cups. Position the heater near the mouth of the filter, to ensure that the water gets evenly heated. Plug in the heater and install the thermometer so you can begin monitoring the temperature.  Adjust the heater so that the temperature rises to between 78 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have a tank light, turn it on to see whether it affects the temperature of the tank. If the light seems to drastically affect the temperature, you'll need to get a better light before you introduce fish to the tank. Dechlorinator is essential, because it removes chlorine/chloramines and heavy metals from the water. It's necessary to add this if you filled your tank with tap water that contains chlorine. Add the amount of dechlorinator instructed for the amount of water in your tank.  If you used bottled spring water, which does not contain chlorine, you may skip this step. You may also want to add a dose of SafeStart, which is a bacterial catalyst that will help promote a healthy environment in the tank. Doing a fishless cycle gives the tank time to build up a beneficial bacteria population for the aquarium nitrogen cycle. If you don't do a fishless cycle, your fish can be killed by high toxin levels in the water, so don't skip this step. See  How to Do a Fishless Cyle to learn exactly how to cycle your tank to meet your betta's needs. You will need to use a water testing kit to monitor the water pH, ammonia and nitrate to make sure the levels are safe for your fish.  The ideal pH is 7. Ammonia and nitrites should be at 0 and nitrates should be less than 20 ppm before you add fish.  You may need to add ammonia remover to bring down the ammonia level.",
      "It's best not to actually bring a fish home until your tank is set up, cycled and ready to go. That way you'll be able to help the betta make the transition to its new home as soon as possible. Go to the pet store and choose a new betta to bring home. Remember, every betta needs its own tank; even females.  Look for an active, healthy betta with a brightly-colored body and undamaged fins. If a betta seems to be floating aimlessly, it may be sick. Choose a one that swims strongly. Float the bag or cup in the tank for twenty minutes to an hour. Keep the bag closed and set the bagged betta into the tank so that the water inside the bag comes to the same temperature as the tank water. This will prevent the betta from getting a temperature shock when it enters the tank. After about one hour, it's time to release the fish. Open the bag and let the fish swim freely into the tank. From now on, care for the betta as follows:  Feed the betta once or twice a day. Provide a varied diet of high-quality betta pellets, frozen & live foods.  Freeze-dried foods are more likely to cause boating and it has little to no nutritional value, it should be used as an occasional bi-weekly treat or rightfully avoided. Do not overfeed, or your betta will become very bloated. If you have a tank that is 5 to 10 gallons (18.9 to 37.9 L), you will need to change out 25% percent of the water every week to maintain a healthy tank. To change the water,  Use a gravel vacuum/siphon to suck debris up into a bucket until you have removed the correct amount of water. You do not need to remove your fish from the tank as you clean it. Dump the water out into the sink, bathtub, or shower and fill it up with clean water. Remember to condition it! Pour in the fresh water. Reintroduce your betta to the tank after the water has heated to the correct temperature. Your cleaning method will depend on the type and size of your chosen tank. Scrub the sides of the tank and any decorations that have collected waste and debris with an unused toothbrush.  Use common sense to determine whether a thorough tank cleaning is needed; if the tank looks filthy, it's time to clean, no matter when you did it last. Monitor the pH, ammonia and nitrate levels as well, and perform partial water changes to lower the levels when necessary.",
      "You may see betta fish housed in tiny plastic bowls in stores, but bettas actually need more space to thrive. For a happy, healthy, and stress free betta, choose a glass or clear acrylic tank that holds at least 2.5 gallons of water, but 5 gallons or larger is highly recommended. Bettas can jump, so make sure the tank has a lid. A tank this size will give the betta plenty of room to swim, the water won't become contaminated as quickly as it would in a smaller tank, it can be heated safely, and the aquarium nitrogen cycle can be established.  Any tank smaller than 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) is not suitable, even if it is only ½ gallon less. Bettas cannot live with other bettas. The idea of a female betta \"sorority\" has appeared on social media, but it is considered unethical and unnatural for your fish. Though it has been done, \"sororities\" should only be attempted by experienced owners. Your best bet is to house each betta separately, so you'll need a tank for each betta you want to own. This will provide your pet with a stress-free life. Bettas naturally live in large bodies of water with a gentle current. Their long, flowing fins make it difficult for them to fight stronger currents, so it's important to choose a filter that is labeled \"gentle\" or comes with adjustable settings. Choose a filter that is designed to fit with the tank size and type of you have chosen.   If you have a stronger filter, it is possible to create current buffers using plants or a cut water bottle. A filter is necessary for bettas (and all aquarium fish) because they are essential for the nitrogen cycle to keep toxins from building up in the water. Bettas are a tropical species of fish, and they do best in water that stays between 78 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. To be safe, get a thermometer to make sure the water is the correct temperature.  If you have chosen to use a tank smaller than five gallons, it can be risky to use a water heater, as the tank can overheat. This is another good reason to get a sizable tank for your betta fish. It is an important part of the tank environment. Along with housing some beneficial bacteria, it creates a more naturalistic environment for your fish and is pleasing to your eyes. Choose fine gravel or sand rather than gravel made with larger pieces of rock. Food and waste can get caught among the larger rocks and create more ammonia.  If you are using live plants in your tank, you will need two inches of substrate so the plants can root. If you are using fake plants (silk plants are often recommended over plastic, due to their softer edges) , one inch is sufficient. Choose substrate in natural colors like white, black, and brown to line your tank. Bright neon substrate like pink and orange will make the environment feel less natural your betta. Live plants help provide oxygen, remove nitrates, and provide a natural environment for your betta. Decorations are essential because they provide enrichment and hiding spots for your fish. If you want to include live plants, choose plants that grow well in the conditions of the tank, taking the light strength, temperature and substrate type into account.  Remember that the gravel should be at least two inches deep to support live plants. Using real plants creates a more natural micro-ecosystem in the tank, with the plants filtering out waste for fertilizer and adding oxygen to the water as they \"breathe\". Anubias nana, java fern, and marimo balls are good beginner plants because they do not require fertilizer or carbon dioxide and do not need very much light. If you want to use fake plants, most people will recommend that they're silk and do not have sharp edges. Bettas' long, fragile fins can be injured when they swim near the plants. Choose other decorations to keep your betta happy. Structures that allow them to hide, such as caves or tunnels, are excellent choices for ensuring that your fish feels safe and secure in its home. Be sure that the decorations you choose do not have ANY sharp edges or rough surfaces that could snag your betta's fins. Use fine grit sandpaper or an emery board to smooth down troublesome spots."

      "Obsession also prevents your personal growth and individuation. It isn't possible to get all that you need in life from another human being and trying to do so will smother the other person and will leave you feeling dependent and helpless. These are all negative outcomes for both you and the person you're in the relationship with. You love a person because of who you are, not because of who they are. This person cannot fulfill the things that lack within you; only you can do that. Being in love is a choice, not something that is visited upon you as some sort of salvation. Love isn't an excuse or a distraction from the challenges you're facing in life. Love isn't a way to hide from the hard task of growing up, maturing and finding your own pathway in life. While you are obsessing over one person, it is possible that you are failing to see the limitations of the relationship and its use-by date. Meanwhile, the person who would actually be more compatible with you might walk right on by while you're enslaved to an obsessive, one-sided relationship. By not obsessing over any person in your life, you free yourself to know that the relationships you are in are right for you, and if not, to start extricating yourself and looking for healthier connections. The person you're with may have priorities in his or her life that you just don't understand.  Becoming obsessed and hoping like crazy that your mere existence will be enough to change these priorities reveals a lack of understanding and suggests that you're in need of a reality check. People who change plans because of someone pushing them tend to end up really resenting that person. It may not show now but it will surface eventually, and it often happens when you're so deeply embedded that losing this person is like losing a part of yourself. It is better to be wise to the possibilities from the start rather than to fantasize, cajole and pressure this person into loving you. If you think this is the right person for you, remind yourself that they may not be in the same stage of the relationship as you are. Relax and be yourself instead of trying to make things happen faster. Adjust your pace. Not everyone falls in love at the same rate and if you turn the heat down a little, you will feel better and they just may miss you enough to make a deeper commitment.",
      "That way, you can give yourself some space so you can work through it. Until you admit you have a problem, you will have a hard time overcoming it. first and foremost. Do not mistake self-love for self-absorption; they are not related. Self-love is about respecting your own dignity and supporting it, recognizing and nourishing your own talents and caring for your own needs and wants. Having a sense of purpose that matches who you are is handy too, although it may take some people longer than others to truly work out who they are.  In contrast, self-absorption is about placing your own needs and desires before anyone else's. Self-absorbed people may be desperate for others' approval and not have a great opinion about themselves. The more confused about who you are, the more you owe it to other people to not obsess over them and to draw clear lines in any relationship about how you are still \"finding yourself\". This isn't the same as not wanting to commit; that too is a form of hiding from reality. This is about telling the other person that you're still finding your way in life, that you sometimes feel confused and to let you know if you ever start trying to blur the boundaries by over-relying on the support, love and attention from this person instead of standing on your own two feet. Honesty will help both of you steer through the challenges ahead with open eyes. One of the signs of an obsessed partner is that he or she drops everything and only does what the partner does, only loves what the partner loves and only focuses on what the partner focuses on. A little of this is to be expected when first falling in love but not to such an extent that you replace your interests with those of your partner's. Find a good balance between taking part in your partner's interests out of curiosity, love or simply being affable, while still maintaining the things you love to do in life.  Keep your usual hobbies and sports going. Ask your partner along sometime to see what you do but don't expect a \"forever commitment\" to your interests by your partner either. Start new interests as you continue to grow. Do not stifle your maturation because you fear that your partner won't like you changing or learning new things. A partner who feels this way is unhealthy to be around; all human beings grow and change over time, this is to be expected.  Stay active with your passions. Your relationship is but one passion, not a complete replacement for the range of joys in life. Avoid making the excuse that your partner is everything to you and that you must always be with him or her at the expense of everyone else in your life. While the first few giddy months of a new relationship often contain an element of complete immersion in one another, it isn't good for this to continue for a long time. Make a dedicated effort to get back in touch with friends and family you've lost touch with, and get back into doing your community-spirited activities too. Even better, don't lose touch with anyone even at the beginning stages of the relationship; a good partner will see your commitment to others as part and parcel of who you are and respect it. If you have a partner who demands that you don't see others and that you do nothing else but spend time together, be very wary. This is a sign of a controlling person who may well be manipulating you into obsessing about him or her and not letting anybody else into your lives. You may even end up convincing yourself that you made this choice, when you were actually manipulated into it. Obsession squeezes the fun out of a relationship and turns everything into hard work, causing you to worry about every word and action, to feel jealous about anything and anyone that removes your partner from you. This person may, or may not be, your one true love. Realize that a \"one true love\" is an ideal and it sets you up for obsession through wanting it to be so. If you both work out, it'll be because you've enjoyed one another's company, found it really easy to spend time together and have not fallen apart when apart. If it doesn't work out, then no amount of obsessing would ever have glued back together an incompatible pairing. Avoid hogging their time, wall or scrolling feed. In particular, do not leave snarky or snivelling remarks about their whereabouts, about people they're engaging with online or about your hurt feelings. Everything you type in and save is there for good and the more you obsess in the online environment, the faster it becomes clear to more than just your partner that you have a boundary problem that just isn't healthy. Instead, give each other space online, keep the messages simple and sweet and leave the deep talk for face-to-face time. Quit the Facebook/Twitter stalking. Do you really need to know what your partner is up to all the time? Avoid spending too much time on social media. Find distractions, such as reading a good book and walking in nature. Consider your feelings when this person doesn't call, text or email you. If you're usually so crazy, angry or sad that you put off doing other things to wait and then end up making all sorts of excuses to explain this silence, it's probable that you're obsessed and that you're failing to get on with your life. Don't ever think the other person is sitting around thinking about you. The reality is that, even if you are an incredible person, your partner is probably wrapped up in getting on with their own life. If they feel interested in you, they will take the initiative to contact you. Since they are not doing that, it means they are busy or think you've already connected enough lately or have other things to be doing that don't need your hand-holding. None of these reasons are about you or about leaving you out––they're each about getting on with everyday life in a normal human way. Even if your partner fails to contact you because he or she doesn't much care or is doing suspicious things such as being unfaithful, this is not a reason to obsess. This is a reason to find a new partner! If you lack confidence, have low self-esteem, fear the future or are still dealing with the emotional outfall of a dysfunctional upbringing, seek appropriate help. If you don't seek healthy outlets and find ways of coping with the things that aren't sorted in your own head, there is a risk that you'll try to use your partner as a proxy for feeling better about yourself.  Develop your self-esteem, deal with your feelings of loneliness, and learn to connect with other people outside of a romantic relationship. In this way, you are putting effort into building your sense of self worth rather than hoping to \"catch it\" from another person (it sure doesn't work like that!).  If you feel you \"need\" a partner, use that a warning bell to take a good look at yourself. Nobody \"needs\" a partner; we all need healthy social relationships, supportive people and love but a partner is only one source of that. It is certainly something many people would like in their lives but neediness shouldn't be the motivation to become involved with someone. Love is a choice remember, not an imperative. Pick wisely.  Realize that the irony is that the more you care about yourself and others, the more likely you are to attract someone who will love you deeply. Focusing on being the best person you can be and caring broadly for all people are attractive traits in any person. You cannot obsess another person into loving you more. The cliché \"if you love someone, let them go; if they love you, they will come back\" is never more relevant than when you feel a relationship is wavering. Make it clear that you love this person but that you are not going to put up with second-rate love, shenanigans, unkindness or any other negative behavior and actions. Tell your partner to get their act sorted without expecting your tolerance for misbehavior. If you're obsessive because of bad behavior--trying to \"love someone\" into loving you--it can be really hard to give such an ultimatum and to let go, which can lead you to cling to something that is plain unhealthy for you. You don't deserve incomplete love or a shadow of love; you deserve the entire commitment. So let go and see what happens. If complete love is not forthcoming, you too are free."

      "If they’re already really drunk, consuming additional alcohol puts them in danger of alcohol poisoning. Continuing to drink will also further impair their judgment and could cause them to injure themselves or others.  Try to be direct and refuse to give them any more alcohol. Tell them something like, “Listen, I think you’ve had too much, and I’m a little worried. I can’t give you any more.” To avoid conflict with a belligerent drunk person, try distracting them with a non-alcoholic drink or by putting on a song or movie that they like. If you can’t get the person to listen to you, try to have someone close to them talk them out of drinking any more alcohol. If you’re unable to get them to listen to you, and you’re worried they may become violent or could injure themselves or others, call the police. Water will help dilute the concentration of alcohol in their bloodstream and help them sober up quicker. Alcohol also dehydrates the body, so giving them water will help them feel better the next day as well.  Have them drink a full glass of water before they lie down. Give them sports beverages like Gatorade to replace the sodium and electrolytes that their body may have depleted while drinking. Fatty foods like cheeseburgers and pizza can help dull the effects of alcohol and slow down the absorption from the stomach into the bloodstream. Eating does not reduce the amount of alcohol in their bloodstream, but it can help make them feel better and reduce further absorption.  Be sure not to give them so much food that they overeat and vomit. A cheeseburger and some fries are fine but don’t let them wolf down a whole pizza and 3 burgers or they’re much more likely to vomit. If they don’t have a huge appetite, try salty snacks like peanuts or pretzels. It’s often been said that drinking a cup of coffee will help sober somebody up. However, while a cup of joe will make them more awake, it doesn’t lower the amount of alcohol in their bloodstream. Additionally, the caffeine in the coffee can dehydrate them, which can slow down their body’s ability to process the alcohol and increase the negative effects of a hangover. Black coffee can irritate their stomachs and cause them to vomit if they’re not used to drinking it. Forced vomiting won’t reduce the alcohol that is in their bloodstream, so all it will do is lower their fluid levels and cause them to be further dehydrated. If they’re dehydrated, it will take longer for their body to process and filter the alcohol out of their system. If they feel the need to vomit, then stay with them so they don’t fall and hurt themselves. Vomiting is a natural way for their body to try to expel any alcohol that could still be in their stomach. Once alcohol is in the bloodstream, the only way to get it out is to give their body the time it needs to process it and filter it out. It takes about 1 hour for the body to process 1 drink. There are a variety of factors that determine how long someone needs for their body to fully process the alcohol out of their bloodstream, but it’s the only way to fully remove the effects of alcohol. Even a full night’s rest can sometimes not be enough to fully process the alcohol they consumed. They should not be allowed to operate a vehicle if they still feel the effects.",
      "Their body will continue to absorb alcohol even after they’re asleep or passed out, which can lead to alcohol poisoning. They could also choke to death on their own vomit if they fall asleep in the wrong position. Don’t assume that a drunk person will be fine once they fall asleep. If the person doesn’t appear to be at risk of alcohol poisoning, sleeping it off can give their body the time it needs to process the alcohol and remove it from their bloodstream. However, they could be at risk of vomiting while they sleep and choking on it. Always make sure they sleep on their side with a pillow behind them to keep them from rolling onto their back.  They should be sleeping in a position where vomit would fall out of their mouth if they vomited in their sleep. The fetal position is a safe position for a drunk person to sleep in. Place a pillow in front of them to keep them from rolling onto their stomach where they could struggle to breathe as well. Even when they stop drinking alcohol, their body will continue to process the alcohol that they’ve already consumed. That means that their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) could increase while they sleep. For the first hour that they fall asleep, wake them every 5-10 minutes and check for signs of alcohol poisoning. After the first hour, if they seem to be doing well, you can check on them once every hour or so. If the person is extremely drunk, they should be monitored continuously to make sure they aren’t at risk of alcohol poisoning or choking on their own vomit. Someone should be with them overnight to check their breathing.  If you don’t know them, ask if you can call someone to come get them. Never let a drunk person watch another drunk person. If you’ve been drinking, have someone sober help you monitor them. If you’re at a restaurant or bar and you don’t know the drunk person, alert the staff that they have a drunk person on the premises who may need assistance. Don’t leave the person until you’re confident that someone will take care of them.",
      "Knowing what they had to drink and how much of it can help you decide what the best course of action is. How much they drank, how fast they drank it, how big they are, their tolerance, and whether or not they ate before they drank can all influence how drunk they are. It’s possible they may just need to sleep it off, but you can’t know that unless you know how much alcohol they consumed.  Try asking something like, “How are you feeling? Do you know how much you drank? Did you have anything to eat today?” That can give you an idea of how much they consumed. If they’ve had more than 5 drinks on an empty stomach, they could be dangerously drunk and may require medical assistance. If they’re incoherent and unable to understand you, it could be a sign of alcohol poisoning. Get them to a hospital as soon as you can. If you’ve been drinking, do not drive. Call an ambulance or have a trustworthy sober person drive you and the drunk person to a hospital. Depending on how drunk the person is, they may be confused and disoriented and not fully understand what you’re trying to do. They may also not be thinking rationally, and if you try to force them to do something, it could cause them to be combative and possibly harm themselves or others. Always announce your intentions.  If they’re hugging the toilet and appear to be having trouble, say something like, “Hey, I’m right here if you need anything. Let me help you keep your hair out of the way.” Don’t touch or move someone without asking them if it’s okay for you to do so. If they are passed out, try to wake them by calling out to them to make sure they’re conscious. You could shout something like, “Hey! Are you okay?” If they don’t respond to any of your statements and appear to be unconscious, call for medical assistance immediately. Alcohol poisoning can be fatal if it isn’t treated quickly and correctly. If they have pale skin, their skin feels cold and clammy to the touch, or they have slow or irregular breathing patterns, call an ambulance or take them to a hospital immediately. Additional signs of alcohol poisoning include vomiting, a general state of confusion, and loss of consciousness. If they have a seizure, their life could be in serious jeopardy. Don’t waste any time: call an ambulance or get them to a hospital as soon as possible. If you know the person, try to get them home so they can sober up and aren’t going to hurt anybody. If you don’t know the person and you’re out in public, try to find someone who knows them to help keep them safe. If they’re too drunk to take care of themselves, they need to be brought to a safe place.  Do not drive if you’ve been drinking and never let a drunk person drive a vehicle. Have a designated driver or use a ride-sharing app like Uber or Lyft to get home safely. Go to a place at which the person will feel comfortable and safe like your home, theirs, or a trusted friend’s home."

      "Cold sores are very contagious and can be spread even in the early stages of an outbreak, before a blister develops. The virus can spread from person to person through shared utensils, razors, and towels or through kissing. Oral sex can also spread herpes. HSV-1 can spread to the genital area, and HSV-2 can spread to the lips. The herpes virus uses the amino acid arginine to grow and replicate. When you take in a lot of arginine through your food, your body is more vulnerable to attacks from the virus. As a result, you will have more frequent cold sore outbreaks. Avoid the following arginine-rich foods:  Chocolate Nuts Peanuts Seeds Cereal grains Even when you're not having an outbreak, it's a good idea to take a daily lysine supplement to prevent future outbreaks. 1 – 3 grams of lysine supplement may reduce the number and severity of herpes outbreaks. You can also make a point to work foods that naturally contain large amounts of lysine into your regular diet:  Fish Chicken Beef Lamb Milk Cheese Beans. Though the virus works differently from person to person, there are common triggers known to cause herpes outbreaks. By reducing these triggers (if you can), you may experience fewer outbreaks:  Viral fever Hormonal changes, such as menstrual periods or pregnancy Changes in your immune system, like severe burns, chemotherapy, or anti-rejection drugs after organ transplants  Stress Fatigue Exposure to sun and wind The healthier your body is as a whole, the better it will be able to suppress the virus, thus reducing the frequency of outbreaks.  Eat a healthy diet with foods rich in lysine. Reduce your intake of arginine-rich foods. Sleep at least 8 hours each night. Exercise each day to help reduce stress levels. Take vitamin supplements to reduce your risk of developing a viral fever. Wear protection on your lips when you're out in the sun.",
      "Without exception, the virus remains permanently in the body once it's been introduced. The virus can stay dormant, without activity, for years — in fact, most people who have herpes don't even know they have it. Regardless, the virus continues to live inside the body and will reappear when conditions are right. If your infection causes you to break out with cold sores, you will continue to get cold sores for the rest of your life. Don’t panic, though! Cold sores are a manageable symptom that don’t have to interfere with your life. There are several things you can do to get rid of a cold sore when one develops. Docosanol (also known as Abreva) is an FDA approved medication for the treatment of cold sores. Its active ingredients are benzyl alcohol and light mineral oil, and it can reduce the duration of the outbreak to just a couple days. For the best results, begin use as soon as you notice the tingling and itching that suggests an oncoming outbreak. However, you can still begin use after the blister has already appeared. Some people may only get cold sores sporadically throughout their lifetime, while others may be plagued by frequent outbreaks. If frequent outbreaks are becoming a hassle for you, you may benefit from antiviral medication to prevent them. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of getting a prescription for acyclovir (Zovirax), valacyclovir, famciclovir, or Denavir. There may not be a cure, but there are many treatments that will reduce the pain from the blisters. FDA-approved pain relievers for external use include benzyl alcohol, dibucaine, dyclonine, juniper tar, lidocaine, menthol, phenol, tetracaine and benzocaine. You can also apply an ice pack to the cold sore to ease pain and discomfort. Be sure to protect the skin from direct contact with ice by using a washcloth or rag as a barrier. Coconut oil has potent antiviral properties. One of its key components is lauric acid, which contains a molecule called \"monocaprin.\" In laboratory testing with monocaprin, researchers found it highly effective against HSV-1.  Begin using the coconut oil as soon as you notice the cold sore developing. Apply it with a Q-tip instead of your finger, as you don't want to touch a cold sore and spread the infection around. Herpes simplex viruses need an amino acid called \"arginine\" to multiply or grow. \"Lysine\" is an amino acid that counteracts the reproductive effects of arginine. Lysine is available both as a topical product (ointments) and as an oral supplement (pills). Use these products daily while you have an outbreak.  You can also make your own topical lysine application at home. Crush a lysine pill and mix it with a small amount of coconut oil. Apply the paste directly to the blister. This way you can attack the cold sore both with a pill and with an external treatment.",
      "Up to 60% of Americans have  HSV-1 by adolescence; 85% by the time they reached their 60s. In Britain, about seven in ten people have it, but only one in five are aware of it.  This is because some people carry the infection, but don’t have any symptoms. The symptoms of a cold sore are consistent, but the first outbreak is different. At that time, you'll see symptoms that you won't experience again during later outbreaks. These one-time symptoms include:  Fever Painful or eroded gums if the cold sore is in the mouth Sore throat Headache Swollen lymph glands Muscle aches After your first outbreak has passed, you'll be able to predict when cold sores are going to appear by looking for early indicators. The area where the sore will appear will suddenly feel tingly and itchy. You may also experience some numbness in the area. This stage, also called the prodromal stage, is experienced by 46% to 60% of people who have cold sores. Other early symptoms include inflammation, redness, hypersensitivity or soreness in the exact area the blisters will appear. When a cold sore is first appearing, it can look like the start of a pimple. It will be sore — possibly painful. This area will be red and raised; the skin surrounding the raised area will also be red. You may also notice several small blisters that develop together, then merge as other blisters fill in the area between them. Cold sores can vary in size, ranging from 2 – 3 mm to 7 mm. The raised areas take on the appearance of a blister. As the body fights the HSV-1 virus, white blood cells rush to the area and the blister fills with clear fluid containing the virus. Because cold sores are filled with infectious fluid, you should never pick at them. If you get the virus on your hands, you can spread it around to other people or get it in your eyes, or spread it to your genitals. This is the third and most painful stage in the development of a cold sore. The area will be moist, with a red area around the open sore. This period, when the blister leaks fluid, is the most contagious. Make sure to wash your hands regularly if you touch your face to prevent spreading the infection. It will take up to three days for the cold sore to move to its next stage. After the blister has burst, a crust will form over the top of the blister, followed by a protective scab. As the sore heals, the scab may crack open and bleed. You may also experience itching and pain during this stage. Avoid touching the sore, as you can slow down the healing process by reopening the wound. You remain contagious until the scab falls off naturally to reveal intact, healthy skin. In this final healing stage when the scab falls off, the skin beneath it will be dry and a little flaky. The area may also be a little swollen and red. From the start of tingling and itching until the scab comes off can take between 8 and 12 days.  Be careful not to share glasses or utensils with anybody until the cold sore has healed completely. Do not kiss anyone or place your cold sores into contact with others in any way. Keep your hands off your face as best you can, as infectious fluid can be transferred to you skin. This, in turn, can spread infection to others, or spread it to other parts of your own body. Canker sores and mucositis can be mistaken for cold sores, but aren't caused by the herpes virus.  Canker sores appear inside the mouth, often near where the cheeks/lips meet the gums. People who wear braces can get them where the braces rub against the cheeks. Doctors believe they can have many causes: injury, certain toothpastes, food sensitivities, stress, allergies, and inflammatory or immune disorders.  Mucositis is the term used to describe the sores that appear in the mouth and esophagus during chemotherapy. Chemotherapy kills rapidly dividing cancer cells. But it can't distinguish cancer from the cells in the mouth, which also divide rapidly. The resulting open sores are extremely painful."

      "Having low self-esteem and many worries about how others view you might make sharing parts of yourself seem unthinkable. Remind yourself that even if you are preoccupied with yourself, maybe even sick of thinking about yourself, people in your life experience the opposite. As a shy person, people you care about may be wishing that they know or understand you better. By making attempts to let some of this inner-world out, you are also opening yourself up to other perspectives. If your self-image is quite negative, chances are good that opening up to those you trust will only help you see great parts of you that you fail to consider. When you want to open up to friends, family, or a romantic partner, don't be afraid to be frank about where you're coming from. By letting your guard down and talking about how you presently feel, others will feel instantly connected to a deeper part of you. Most importantly, the other person will not recoil in doubt or fear that something wrong with him makes it difficult for you to open up.  Try starting with something like \"I want you to know that I'm a little shy talking about this, so please bear with me.\" This statement enlists support rather than making an excuse. Remember that you do not need to apologize for your level of progress in opening up. Apologizing will set off doubt and passivity. Make sure that you are not owning your shyness to signal that you need sympathy or babying. The purpose is to give insight into why you might seem nervous or aloof. Having patience and support from others should ultimately help you take risks and display effort as you learn how to be more comfortable opening up. Turn your focus outward and let the other person motivate your desire to open up. Watch facial expressions and listen for raises in tone that cue you in to what the person is getting excited about. Excitement is contagious, and with deep engagement it'll be hard not to return it.  Deep attention to the cues of others does not mean that you should take a subordinate position in conversation. For instance, if your brother is detailing a problem that he's having at work, you could respond either by asking for more information, giving comforting advice and input, or sharing a similar experience. Shyness is, in part, an excessive self-focus, which makes it difficult to respond appropriately to others. Focusing on others more generally is an exercise that will lift you further and further out of extreme shyness. Begin to trust in the fact that having someone's attention in an intimate setting is happening in the first place because they already hope to hear more from you. Ease into openness by reminding yourself that there is no right and wrong to your feelings. If you feel judged or fear judgment, ask yourself \"who is judging me here?\" Opening up to others can be how you get away from your harshest critic--yourself.  There is always something to share from the heart. Do you feel blank, empty, or at a loss? Those are some pretty intimate things to let someone know. You may even unleash a whole stream of feelings and memories surrounding that very fact. You might begin by saying \"You know, it's funny, whenever I go to talk about myself, I come up with a big blank space. Sometimes I wonder what it is that won't quite come out...\"",
      "Don't stress yourself out by arriving anywhere without a handful of small-talk ideas.Stay up to date with current events, the latest club or restaurant openings in your area, or anything else that might spice things up. Having at least five or six things to hit on will allow you the flexibility to bring up something that fits with the moment you're in. In addition to general talking points, come in with a sense of what this group of people find relevant. If you're going to a party where a jazz band is playing, brush up on music-related topics. Don't force yourself to go to any events or gatherings that seem especially intimidating. You can also try setting flexible time limits for yourself. Even if you want to stay longer, know that you have an agreement with yourself to stay a minimum of, say, two hours. Arriving places early can help you feel more secure, as you will have time to adjust to the atmosphere. Sometimes the panic caused by arriving to a full venue or house can be enough to plunge back into old habits of self-doubt. Use your demeanor to show that you actually want to be approached. If your hands are in your purse or busy texting, others might sense that you are occupied or blatantly uninterested in engaging. Try to envision how you carry yourself when you're around someone you trust. Perhaps your eyes are present and not focused on your feet. Your arms are probably uncrossed, and you're not hiding under layers of sweaters and coats. Review some of your recent experiences, and trust that once you begin talking, you have a heftier conversation piece. Maybe you recently watched a police chase or went on a chat-worthy vacation. Start off with a simple comment about something anyone might be able to respond to--\"How's that beer treating you?\" or \"I know I've heard this song before, but I can't place it!\"  It's always a safe bet is to comment on your immediate environment. When you share your observations about the neighborhood you're in, the group you're with, or the food being served, you are inviting the person to become a meta-commentator with you. This sets the two of you on a shared mission of finding and sharing oddities and interest in your surroundings. Throw in as many extra tidbits and details as you can. This will help keep the conversation from flat-lining. If someone asks you how you're doing, avoid simply saying \"good.\" Try something like \"good, especially considering the day I had yesterday, oh man!\" When sharing observations, related experiences, and insights, try to avoid excusing and apologizing for yourself. Lead-ins like \"maybe it's just me...\" and \"sorry, but I have to say...\" come off as scared and lacking confidence. .There are certain physical actions that will indicate you are engaged in your conversations with others. Eye contact, hand gestures and nodding all let your listeners know that you care and want to keep on going. When talking is the main challenge, it’s easy to forget that half of opening up is truly listening. When you’re very focused on what’s being said, producing a response comes more naturally—you won’t be caught off guard. Chances are your shyness will prohibit you from talking as much as others, so make up for it in close listening. Open questions are questions that ask for a response that goes beyond just a \"yes\" or a \"no\". By asking these questions once you get the gist of a conversation, you will show others that you are taking a real interest in what’s going on.  For example, if someone is recounting getting stuck in a traffic jam, don't ask how long it took to get home. Instead, try asking \"How do you deal with boredom on long trips?\" or \"What part of coming home makes you the happiest to be there?\" Instead of a curt answer like \"usually a full hour\", you'll get an answer that will smoothly branch out to other topics. What’s more, throwing an open question out means that more talkative people will take the lead. Then, you'll have the bold speakers directing themselves toward you, the interested party. Think of yourself as a casual journalist, eager to learn about others and unashamed to probe them to talk about themselves. Not only are you not invading their privacy, but you're letting other attendees talk about the topic in which they have the most fluidity and expertise. The best way to do this is by making an empathetic, person-to-person connection by smiling. When you smile and make eye contact, you are signaling that you're friendly, open to conversation, and are someone who wants to engage. This works equally well with friends and strangers--we're hard-wired to enjoy mutual smiling. It's like giving a long-distance pat on the back!  Keep in mind that everyone is present because they want to interact. If you feel as if you're being too forward or imposing on the person, remember that in all likelihood they are relieved and excited to have caught someone's attention. When you send these warm, kind signals out, conversation may be quite different. Instead of introducing yourself formally, you might just hop right in with \"This is becoming quite a night, isn't it?\" or \"Hey there, I can't help but gravitate toward the cheery ones here...\" Turn the fearful situation into a place of introspection and personal growth. Become the observer and dig into yourself, answer the questions: why do I feel this way? What caused me to feel this way? Can there be an alternative explanation to what is happening?”  Say you're only 30 minutes into a party and you're starting to get anxious. Don't be afraid to use the bathroom or another private space you can find to check in with yourself and use some quick methods to calm down. Don't give up in uncomfortable situations. Allow yourself to become desensitized to moments that you would typically run from. You might find that a little bit of awkwardness or silence can be comical and is not the disaster that you envision it being.",
      "Look deep inside and journal about the things that you cherish most about yourself. Maybe you are very nurturing, understanding, or compassionate. Consider what a shame it would be if the rest of the world never got to share in these gifts.  Look at what you're good at doing. Identifying your strengths will help boost your self esteem. So, if you're caught in a moment of self-doubt or shame you'll always have a strength come quickly to mind. Focus on how your habits work to your advantage. For instance, you might be someone who prefers one-on-one conversations and time spent in nature. All this intimate time with yourself and another might be making you a better listener and more aware of your feelings. These are strengths that are difficult to cultivate as a big voice in a large social group. Accept yourself as someone who has lots to offer, even though being the life of the party isn't your thing. Doing this will give you more realistic expectations for what will happen when you open up. You may find, for example, that when you open up you create deep connections with select people rather than filling up your phone contacts with half-remembered faces.  One cautionary note about labeling yourself: Be sure that you don't box yourself in. Many people call themselves shy as an excuse to keep from facing the difficulties of opening up. Consider shyness as a different style of relating that presents some hardships to overcome rather than a blunt fact about your limitations. The thing to realize is that many of the things that make you label yourself as shy (i.e. enjoying time alone, getting exhausted by banal party conversations, not always having something to say) are experiences that most people have, shy or not. Avoid spending time analyzing situations that felt awkward or uncomfortable and beating yourself up for having been a part of the cause.  Recognize that the world is not looking at you. Besides, most people are too busy looking at themselves. Instead of watching yourself as if you are other people, bring your awareness inwards. Armed with your understanding of what makes you shy, seek within yourself and become the observing presence of your thoughts. Self-pity will only direct your energy to beating yourself up rather than do anything with what happened. Take solace in the fact that hardly anyone noticed that you fumbled through that last comment. Since you are the one taking notice, treat yourself how you would another well-meaning shy person. Chuckle lovingly at yourself for having tried so hard, move on, and try again. Remember that rejection is part of life, and how we learn to understand the difference between ourselves and others. Say you are at a gathering and someone who you are talking to edges away, leaving you by yourself. Instead of blaming yourself, try to recognize that the scenario was not the best fit for both parties.  Switch your attention to finding a lesson in what happened. Perhaps the person who went to talk to someone else was having a hard day and saw a close friend walk through the door. From this, you can take the lesson that meeting one's own needs for solidarity can (and sometimes should) override social graces. There are no wholly negative experiences if you can find something to learn from and carry forward. Make sure to reward your efforts even if the situation didn't have the outcome that you expected. Look honestly at what you did to make conversation and listen well. Take your progress into account--maybe you couldn't have mustered up the confidence to do this a month ago--and be proud! After all, we can only change ourselves and our attitudes. Outcomes always rest on the innumerable parts of life that are beyond our control. Often times, having unrealistic expectations crushes the ability to notice the good things that we take part in. Ask yourself, \"do I believe deep down that I should be able to talk to and like everyone?\" It is simply a fact of life that we will not be motivated to open up to everyone.Make sure your mission to open up to others isn't an attempt to triumph over your natural sense of who you can and cannot trust. Perfectionism can also surface when we are trying to make others see us in a certain way. Take the pressure off yourself and realize that you do not have to (and cannot) control how others see you. This means that in social situations your job is to observe others and enter in when you can contribute positively--a much easier job than monitoring everything you do and obsess over how you're being received. Words have an amazing power to stick in our minds. Try replacing negative self-judgments and criticism with encouragement. When something like \"I'm too shy to talk to anyone\" pops into your head, remind yourself that you are capable of interacting with others and have the confidence to be uniquely you. Re-training your mind to bring up affirmation rather than doubt will also allow you to be more aware of your successes, as you increasingly spot evidence of your abilities and contributions. Opening up is instantly easier if you can find something to say, and writing is a great way to find your voice. Whether you are writing about things that happen to you or what you read on the news, you will become more comfortable constructing opinions and forming responses to your surroundings. In this way, you are exercising the wordy part of your mind that can have a thought about nearly anything. And if you find yourself wanting to bring up a new topic, you can relay things you've written about (presumably something), telling people \"the other day I was thinking about ___\""

      "for a put-together look. Braiding your hair will not only look cute, but it’s also a great way to keep your hair out of your face. There are many different options, from a waterfall braid to a French braid, or even the traditional braid. Choose a style that works with your hair type and length. for a soft, girly look. Curls are always cute, as they give your face a softened look. There are several ways you can curl your hair. By using things such as a curling iron, flat iron, or hair rollers, you’ll have curly hair in no time. Some methods of curling your hair, such as using hair rollers or braids, should be started the night before. Plan ahead and make sure you have enough time to properly style your hair. For days when you want a quick hair fix that’s also stylish and cute, pull your hair into a ponytail. This could be a side ponytail, pigtails, a high ponytail — whichever style you think looks the cutest. Add an accessory such as a colorful scrunchie or headband to your ponytail if you want. If you happen to be one of those girls who rolls out of bed with naturally beautiful hair, then you’re ready to go! Either give it a quick brush or use a styling product to bring out volume and tame unruly hairs. Wearing your hair naturally gives you a soft, gorgeous look. If your hair is on the shorter side or you don’t have a lot of time in the mornings, opt for a hair accessory. Headbands, scrunchies, clips, and so many other hair accessories are available in a variety of colors, patterns, and fabrics. Visit an accessory store, drug store, or big-box store near you to pick out a new hair accessory. Most hair accessories cost less than $10, and they can be found online as well. Wearing makeup can be a great way to boost your self-confidence and cover up any imperfections you don’t want seen, but don’t overdo it. When it comes to looking cute while wearing makeup, less is more. Highlight your face using a blush, and pick out a natural or light shade of lip gloss. Swipe on a little bit of mascara if you have light eyelashes, but keep any eyeliner very minimal.  If you feel like you don’t need makeup, awesome! Only apply it if you want to. Putting a thin line of eyeliner on each of your top eyelids will make your eyes stand out more, but avoid putting much, if any, on the bottom lid.",
      "Cute clothing tends to be associated with soft colors, not dark ones. Choose clothes with colorful or pastel tones, and stay away from dark colors such as black, gray, and brown.  Pastel blues, purples, and pinks are good options for cute colors. Spend some time looking on Pinterest or fashion blogs for inspiration on how to create cute outfits. Not only are these tops super comfortable, but they give off a very cute and laid-back vibe. Look for loose tops that have lace, ribbons, bows, or any other decorative add-on. Patterned or printed shirts are always a great option, just make sure the colors stay light! Skirts are a great clothing option for looking cute. Choose skirts that are flowy and made of a comfortable fabric. Picking shorts that have flowers, stripes, or another pattern on them will show off your sense of style. Stick to colorful or pastel colors, and make sure your skirts and shorts are school-appropriate.  Be careful not to choose shorts or skirts that are too short, and stick to your school's dress code. If you're not a fan of skirts, no problem! Look for pants that have patterns on them or are made of a unique fabric or color that you like. Embellished jeans are always a cute option, too. The right dress will do wonders for making your outfit look cute. Choose a dress style that’s appropriate for school — short- or long-sleeved dresses are best, but if you’re allowed to wear spaghetti strap dresses, go for it! Pick out dresses in light colors, and look for special additions such as lace or pleats. Some school dress codes will allow you to wear a spaghetti strap dress if you wear a sweater over your shoulders, so see if this is an option for you. To take your outerwear to the next level of cute, find jackets that have their own style. Look for large buttons on jackets, outerwear made of a unique material, or coats that have floral or animal prints. When it comes to shoes, look for pretty colors, fabrics, and unique patterns as well. Options for cute shoes include ballet flats, colorful or patterned sneakers, and stylish boots. When the weather gets cooler, your skirts and dresses aren’t going to keep you warm. Leggings these days come in tons of different colors, patterns, and styles. Choose leggings that are light in color, or even opt for tights that have a feminine touch. To make your outfit even better, add some jewelry or a hair accessory. Find some statement pieces that you love, such as a pair of silver heart earrings or a patterned headband. You don’t need to go crazy with the accessorizing, but adding one or two pieces can greatly improve your outfit. If you wear glasses, find a pair that comes in a pretty color or unique design. You can do the same for sunglasses, too.",
      ". Being cute isn’t just about your appearance, it’s about having self-confidence and feeling good in your own skin. Embrace all aspects of yourself and don’t spend time worrying about insecurities. If you think confident thoughts on the inside, that confidence will show through on the outside.  Doing things such as taking care of your personal hygiene, having great posture, and making eye contact with people when you talk to them will help bring out your confidence. Think about activities you're good at or talents you might have. If these are things you love doing, take more time to pursue them — this will help increase your confidence as well. People don’t tend to associate “cute” with a loud, abrasive voice. You don’t need to whisper, but talk softly. Use tones that are warm and bubbly, without speaking too loudly. The happier and more positive that you are around others, the more they’re going to want to hang out with you. Spread your positive outlook to others by saying positive things and cheering people up when they’re feeling down. A cute girl is cute because her attitude radiates bubbliness, kindness, and acceptance of herself and others. One of the best ways to radiate positive vibes is to show how happy you are with a smile. If people see you smiling, they’ll be much more likely to want to interact with you. Give a smile to people you pass in the halls, the peers that sit next to you in class, and to your teachers. A little happiness goes a long way. . If you’re spending all of your time trying to be something that you’re not, you aren’t going to be happy. Relax and just be yourself — don’t stress about your appearance or what people think of you. By being your own cute, authentic self, everyone around you will think you're cute as well.  Cute girls tend to observe more and talk less, so if you’re not super outspoken, that’s OK! Embrace your shyness and use it to your advantage — oftentimes, shy people are seen as coy or flirtatious, which can be very cute.  If you are outspoken, don’t feel like you need to suddenly convert to being shy. Keep being your outgoing self, but just try to listen to others as much as you talk. Don’t let being cute become your entire focus. A cute girl is intelligent and interested in learning more about the world, so don’t forget to focus on your schoolwork as well. Doing your homework and studying hard will make you a cute girl who is knowledgeable and mature. Don’t pretend to be dumb or clueless because you think it’s cute. You should be able to show off how cute you are while also being yourself. Cute girls are nice to everyone that they talk to and are able to make others feel comfortable when they’re around. To do this, try to be friendly towards all of your classmates. Compliment someone on their shirt, say hello in the halls, or help out a classmate with their schoolwork. By being nice to everyone, your peers will see you as a cute, friendly person. . This one is simple — the more polite and well-mannered you are, the cuter. Everyone likes someone who is polite and kind to them, so try to be friendly and courteous whenever you interact with someone, whether it’s a peer or a teacher."

      "For instance, look at the equation 12/26 – 4/26 – 1/26. In this example:  The numerators are 12, 4, and 1 The common denominator is 26 Like with addition, you don’t have to worry about doing anything to the denominator, so just find the difference between the numerators:  12 – 4 – 1 = 7 Rewrite the fraction with the new numerator. 12/26 – 4/26 – 1/26 = 7/26. Similar to adding fractions, when you subtract fractions you can still end up with:  An improper fraction that can be converted to a mixed number A fraction that can be solved through division A fraction that can be put into a simpler form by finding a common denominator",
      "Fractions don’t always have the same denominators, and in order to add or subtract those fractions, you must first find a common denominator. To start, locate the denominators in the fractions you’re dealing with. For instance, in the equation 5/8 + 6/9, the denominators are 8 and 9. To find a common denominator, you need to find the least common multiple of the two numbers, which is the smallest positive number that’s a multiple of both original numbers. To find the least common multiple of 8 and 9, you must first go through the multiples of each number:  The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, etc. The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, etc. The least common multiple of 8 and 9 is 72. Multiply each denominator by the correct number to achieve the common denominator. Remember that whatever you do to each denominator, you must also do to its numerator.  For the fraction 5/8: to achieve the common denominator of 72, you multiply 8 x 9. Therefore, you must also multiply the numerator by 9, giving you 5 x 9 = 45 For the fraction 6/9: to achieve the common denominator of 72, you multiply 9 x 8. Therefore, you must also multiply the numerator by 8, giving you 6 x 8 = 48 The new fraction will have the common denominator and the product of the numerators multiplied by the same values:  The fraction 5/8 becomes 45/72, and the fraction 6/9 becomes 48/72. Since they now have a common denominator, you can add the fractions 45/72 + 48/72 = 93/72. Don’t forget to reduce, solve, or convert improper fractions to mixed numbers when applicable and necessary.",
      "There are two parts to all fractions: the numerator, which is the number above the line, and the denominator, which is the number below the line. While the denominator tells you how many parts a whole has been broken into, the numerator tells you how many pieces of that whole there are. In the fraction ½, for instance, the numerator = 1 and the denominator = 2, and the fraction is one-half. When two or more fractions have a common denominator, it means they all have the same number as a denominator, or that they all represent wholes that have been broken into the same number of pieces. Fractions with a common denominator can be added together very easily, and the resulting fraction will have the same denominator as the original fractions. For instance:  The fractions 3/5 and 2/5 have a common denominator of 5. The fractions 3/8, 5/8, and 17/8 have a common denominator of 8. To add fractions together when they have a common denominator, you simply add all the numerators together and rewrite the sum over the original denominator.  In the fractions 3/5 and 2/5, the numerators are 3 and 2. In the fractions 3/8, 5/8, and 17/8, the numerators are 3, 5, and 17. In the example of 3/5 + 2/5, add the numerators 3 + 2 = 5. In the example 3/8 + 5/8 + 17/8, add the numerators 3 + 5 + 17 = 25 Remember to use the same common denominator, since the number of parts that the whole is divided into remains the same, and you are just adding the number of individual pieces.  The fractions 3/5 + 2/5 = 5/5 The fractions 3/8 + 5/8 + 17/8 = 25/8 Sometimes a fraction can be put into simpler terms, and this includes dividing it to get a number that’s not a fraction or decimal. In the example 5/5, this fraction can be solved easily because any fraction where the numerator and denominator are the same will equal 1. Think about it like a pie that’s been cut into three pieces. If you eat all three pieces of the pie, then you’ve eaten one whole pie. Any fraction can be converted from a fraction by dividing the numerator by the denominator, and you’ll often end up with a decimal number. For instance, 5/8 can also be written as 5 ÷ 8, which equals 0.625. A fraction is said to be in its simplest form when both the numerator and the denominator don’t have any common factors they can be divided by. For instance, in the fraction 3/6, both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of 3, meaning they can both be divided by 3 to produce a whole number. Therefore, the fraction 3/6 can be thought of as 3 ÷ 3 / 6 ÷ 3 = ½. When a fraction has a numerator that’s bigger than the denominator, such as 25/8, this is said to be an improper fraction (the reverse, when the numerator is smaller than the denominator, is a proper fraction). These can be converted into a mixed number, which is a number that has a whole number plus a proper fraction. To convert an improper fraction like 25/8 to a mixed number, you:  Divide the improper fraction’s numerator by its denominator to determine how many whole times 8 goes into 25, where the answer is 25 ÷ 8 = 3(.125) Determine what’s left over. If 8 x 3 = 24, subtract that from the original numerator: 25 – 24 = 1, where the difference is the new numerator. Rewrite the mixed number. The denominator will be the same from your original improper fraction, meaning 25/8 can be rewritten as 3 1/8."

      "As stated, the attachment you feel to an ex is what makes breakups so difficult. You end up feeling lonely and isolated when this person is suddenly out of your life. Work on forming closer relationships with friends and family members to fill in the gap your ex left.  Relying on people can actual require some training on your part. You might have to force yourself to call your mom or your best friend after a bad day instead of your ex. However, once you learn to rely on these people over your ex he'll be easier to forget.  Remind yourself your ex is not the only person in your life who loves you and who you feel close to. Being single does not have to mean being alone. Having this realization can help you heal and move forward with your life. Do not jump into a new relationship after a bad breakup. This can make you want your ex more. However, casual dating in the wake of a bad breakup can actually help you move forward. It reminds you that you are attractive, desirable, and will find someone again.  Go on casual, fun dates. Have a friend set you up. Attend a singles mixer. Try creating on online dating profile.  Remind yourself you're not necessarily seeking out the love of your life, but rather trying to have fun and date around while you're single. This can help you shift romantic focus away from your ex and out into the world of potential matches. If you have preexisting issues with depression and anxiety, you may need the assistance of a therapist to get over your ex. You can ask for a referral for a therapist from your primary doctor. You can also get a list of therapists from your insurance providers. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your college or university.",
      "Oftentimes, people hang on to their exes past what is healthy. If someone is absent from your life, it's best to work on letting go of the relationship. The first step is tapering off contact.  People develop strong emotional attachments in love. They tend to see their romantic partner as the first person in their life they contact when they need emotional support. When a relationship ends, it can be hard to move away from your ex as you go-to for support. In order to get over the relationship you need to make an effort to do so.  Do not call, text, or e-mail your ex. If necessary, temporarily block him on social media to avoid the temptation to contact him through something like Facebook or Twitter. Minimize the amount of time you spend with your ex and do not engage in activities together that increase feelings of attachment. If watching movies together was a romantic activity for you, for example, do not watch a movie with your ex.  Get rid of any mementos you associate with your ex. This can help remove the temptation to call and talk to him when you're stressed or upset. Consider why you're trying to forget this person. Was the relationship not working? Was the person not nice to you? There are many reasons why a relationship might end and being aware of why yours did not work out can aid in the healing process. Spend time thinking about why things ended and assuring yourself the break up was for the best. Research shows that it's not actually a bad thing to think about a relationship while trying to get over it as long as you think in abstract terms. Remember the emotions you felt during the relationship rather than the physical presence of your ex. Focus on what you enjoyed about being with this person on an emotional level and how lucky you were to experience feelings of love and attachment. Remember the relationship as an abstract concept rather than a physical experience. Contrary to what you may read in women's magazines, there is no magic formula that can tell you when you can expect to get over an ex. A variety of factors impact how long it will take you to get over a relationship. As you attempt to get over a relationship, be patient and accept it will take time. The duration and intensity of the relationship are two of the biggest factors in determining how long it will take you to heal. Longterm relationships of high intensity can take as long as year to get over. However, shorter relationships that were very intense can also be difficult to forget. You might end up seeing the boy at school, work, or around town. It can be hard to forget someone when you're occasionally forced to interact. Try to limit interactions unless absolutely necessary. Be courteous when you see your ex and if you need to work with him on projects, be respectful but stay professional. You will likely experience some feelings of sadness the first few times you have to interact with your ex after the relationship ended. Accept these are normal and will pass with time.",
      "While it's important to acknowledge and experience sadness in the wake of a break up, dwelling on negative thoughts too long eventually becomes counterproductive. Try to stay busy with a variety of hobbies and activities to stop yourself from lingering in sadness.  Find something you enjoy. You can go to a museum, see a movie, do a puzzle, play a video game. Anything that keeps your mind focused on the present moment can help you avoid thinking about your ex.  Create time and space for your hobbies. While it seems strange to stick to a schedule for leisure activity, sometimes this is the only way to get yourself out of the house after a breakup. Promise yourself you'll spend at least 3 nights a week going out or swear you'll only spend one weekend night in alone. Spend more time with a friend, siblings, classmates, and other people you're close to. Being alone can lead you to ruminate on negative thoughts so heavy socialization is vital when it comes to moving forward. Make plans with people you know and make efforts to get to know new people. Attend a club or meeting. Go to a bar alone and talk to a stranger. Attend poetry readings or art shows and see if you meet anyone. Many people fall into the trap of not caring for themselves in the wake of a breakup. As hard as it might be, continue to practice self care even when you're feeling down.  Keep up with eating and sleeping right. Go the gym if you work out regularly. Try not to let day-to-day activities that help you feel your best fall to the wayside.  Push yourself. Doing basic day-to-day tasks might take extra effort during a breakup but poor eating, hygiene, and fitness habits will only exasperate a bad mood. While it's important to keep up with self care, cut yourself some slack in regards to work. Some people feel throwing themselves into work is a great distraction, but this can create a negative pattern. It can be hard to go back to a normal work load once you're feeling better. Try to put in less effort than normal at work and, if possible, take a mental health day to spend time taking care of yourself."

      "If you are feeling unchallenged in certain areas in which you excel, taking on new responsibilities is a great way to shake up your monotonous routine. Consult with your boss about taking on more work in areas in which you already do well, or about a plan to shift your focus to a new project. This will also suggest to your boss that you’re taking pride in the work you're putting out, which can lead to more responsibility and a more fulfilling workday.  Ask for the opportunity to do work outside of your normal expertise, in order to master new skills in the future. Talk with your boss about altering your job description to include new tasks that you find interesting and that are beneficial to the business. Without skirting any of your workplace policies, talk with your coworkers about swapping a few tasks to encourage versatility within the workforce. Learning new skills can help you view your boring job in a whole new way. If you are stuck in a job with little to no room for learning new skills in the field, try listening to educational podcasts. Keeping your brain active is a surefire way to kick the boredom. Try talking to people in other departments about what they do and what their jobs entail. Maybe you’re working in sales but you’re more interested in working in marketing; socialize with people in other departments to get an idea of what other jobs are available that might appeal to you. Resist the temptation to spend lots of time checking emails and social media while you’re working. Although it is healthy to allow your brain to rest and relax throughout the day, schedule yourself specific time to respond to emails and check your social media accounts. Limit the amount of time that you spend doing this. Even though your job may be boring, spending loads of time distracting yourself from your tasks can make the day feel longer and your workload more daunting as the day comes to an end. Pick specific times to check your email and social media accounts, such as once at 11:00am and once at 4:00pm. Spend up to 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the afternoon doing this, but when the 30 minutes is up, dive right back into to working. Offer your help when your coworkers are involved in new or difficult projects. Take the initiative to start on new projects. Involving new people or experiences in your workday can cut down on the monotony of your daily task list. Your colleagues are also a great resource to tap when you've come to a roadblock on a new project, or are trying to master a new skill. Don't hesitate to ask your coworkers for the same hand that you would be happy to lend. When offering help in the workplace, make sure to use statements that are positive, not condescending. If you know your colleagues have started a new project, or have hit a roadblock in a current one, let them know you’re available to help out by saying, “I’m available if you are interested in brainstorming about this project,” or by saying, “I have some ideas that I think could benefit your project.” Instead of spending time daydreaming or nodding off in your meetings, make a strong effort to actively listen and put forth new ideas. Find ways to participate in your meetings. If you are frustrated by meetings and the way they are run in your workplace, consult with your boss about changing their structure. Offer constructive solutions to making meetings more efficient and focused.  If you are unable to actively participate in most meetings in your workplace, take notes or write down questions to discuss with your colleagues after the meeting. If you feel that inefficient meetings are hindering your productivity, consult with your boss on the necessity of your attendance at these meetings. Avoid coming off as angry or aggressive, but suggest that you feel your time could be used more effectively elsewhere. Use your coworkers as sounding boards for new ideas. Ask them how they feel about their jobs, and what they do to combat office boredom. No one understands your office better than your coworkers, so use their knowledge as a resource for things you can do to improve your situation. Together, you may be able to brainstorm ideas for making your meetings more efficient, making your workday more productive, and overall improving the quality of your office’s productivity.",
      "Sometimes, exhaustion can be confused with boredom in the workplace. Often times, exhaustion is the result of poor diet or inconsistent sleeping habits. If you are struggling to stay awake at your desk, taking better care of yourself outside of the office may be the solution. Getting a decent night’s rest and eating properly are pivotal aspects of a more positive disposition.  If waking up for your day is a struggle, make an effort to go to bed an hour earlier. If you find yourself eating a lot of fast food, work on developing a meal plan and doing meal prep on Sunday nights. Replace your fast food meals with fast healthy meals. When you feel your energy level decreasing, a small stretch can breathe new life into your day. If you're finding that your boredom is also causing you to lose energy throughout the day, spend some time stretching to reinvigorate your senses. Incorporating these exercises into your day can reduce stress and keep your mind focused. Research some basic yoga positions that you can do at your desk, such as the high altar pose or ankle to knee positions. If you are able, leave the office for your lunch hour. Take advantage of this time by spending time away from your desk and the office. You may discover that there is a great clothing boutique, delicious restaurant, or beautiful garden close to your office.  If you’ve come to work without a prepared lunch, try ordering a new cuisine that you haven't tried before. If the weather is nice, go for a short walk to get your body moving and your blood flowing. Bring a novel to read. Make you lunch hour beneficial to you by relaxing and preparing yourself to refocus on the day at hand.",
      "Consider whether you are bored with your work, or if your boredom is originating elsewhere. Maybe you're feeling bored at work because you're actually bored with your daily routine. Your commute, your lunch, and your day to day tasks all have to capacity to bore or stimulate your senses. Start combating workplace boredom by changing something about your usual routine each day, so that you can combat the feeling of monotony in the office.  Try a new coffee spot close to your office before work, instead of drinking the regular office coffee. Try mixing up your commute by riding your bicycle or taking the train to work. If your day is filled with the same people, same morning beverages, or the same music, try to incorporate new things. Mix up the day by bringing in something that you can share with your coworkers. If the office always has the same music playing and you are able to change it, put on something upbeat and fun. These small changes can also help to break up the monotonous nature of the workday.  Make small changes for yourself, such as starting your day with a unique beverage each morning. Have cider, green tea, or hot chocolate in the morning, instead of or in addition to your usual coffee. If your office is especially boring in the mornings before everyone has had a chance to settle in, bring in a box of pastries or bagels to share. This will put everyone in a better mood and help you all make it through the day. If you always spend your breaks on social media, make an effort to do something different during your breaks. Maybe this means doing jumping jacks or planning a weekend getaway. Perhaps try picking up a craft or a hobby that you can do in your free work time. Incorporate anything that brightens your mood into your break time, so you have something to look forward to during your boring workday.  Knitting or crochet is a great way to keep your mind busy during your breaks. Try doing crossword puzzles on your breaks. Not only will they keep your mind active, but you’ll have something to ponder while you’re completing your boring work tasks. Plan vacation or getaways to places you've never been during your breaks. These can be real plans, or imaginary plans that you use to motivate yourself! Add personal touches to your work environment. Without violating any specific guidelines set forth by your office, hang a piece of artwork that inspires you. Even if your job is boring, you workspace doesn't have to be. Bring in photos of loved ones, or those you respect or admire. Anything that reminds you of why you are motivated to do well in your current position is a great thing to have at your desk. Create a specific work playlist of music that is both relaxing and stimulating. For some, listening to music through headphones is a great way to drown out distractions. If repetition is a big part of your job, studies have even shown that including music into your routine can increase productivity. Choose music that is inspiring and will brighten your mood. Research the company you are working for. Learn more about the company, what they do, and why the are successful. Ask yourself if you are inspired by their mission statement, or if there is another area within the company or business that you are working for that seems more interesting to you. There may be jobs within the company that actively engage in work you find interesting, even if your current position does not. Look into the possibility of changing roles or departments within your company, so that you have a wider variety of skill sets that benefit your position within the business. Perhaps you feel stuck in a job that required little experience when you were hired, but have become bored with the lack of challenges in your day to day routine. Whether you already have a degree or would like to study a subject that is completely new, seeking higher education can help you start a new career path. Consider heading back to school to complete a degree that mirrors your passions.  Research scholarships and grants that could help you fund this education. If your situation is such that you can’t leave your boring job to go back to school, many universities and colleges offer online classes or classes that can be completed at night or during the weekends. Trade schools are also a great way to learn a skill. Perhaps you have had an interest in becoming a hair stylist, mechanic, or carpenter. Trade schools offer the opportunity to turn your passions into your employment. Typically, trade schools are less expensive and offer flexible programs that take less time to complete than obtaining a degree from a university. Many trade schools also offer flexible programs that can be completed while working a full time job, such as night or weekend classes. If you taken every step to combat workplace boredom and are still feeling lackluster about your current employment situation, it may be time to consider a complete career change. If this isn’t your first boring day to day job, consider the types of jobs you applying for. Perhaps you would prefer working outside, working with people, working from home, making music, etc. Think about the possibility of taking a job in a field that is completely new to you. Sometimes this can involve seeking out higher education, but some forms of employment benefit more from a strong work ethic.  Research new employment possibilities and seek out companies that do work which inspires you. Consider exactly what you’re looking for in a fulfilling job and seek out positions that satisfy your requirements. The food and beverage industry promotes fast paced work and tons of social interaction. Although working in the food and beverage industry isn’t for everyone, restaurant work is a highly respectable profession, that can result in some very lucrative benefits. Jobs that involve physical labor offer many added health benefits to those in these positions. Working outside means access to fresh air and natural sunlight, and putting in physical labor keeps your body active. If you love the great outdoors, consider the possibility of finding work on a farm, in construction, or as a professional landscaper."

      "This is as much for your own records as it is for making sure the account is closed. Sending a letter will finalize the closure of your account and give you a legal written and dated record of your action should anything go wrong with the closure of your account. If you really want to guarantee full legality, send the letter by certified mail and hold on to the receipt you will receive upon paying the certified postage.  In your letter, request written confirmation that the account is closed. Make sure to also include your information, like your name, phone number, and address. You may also want to include proof of payment from when you paid off your remaining account balance. Do so by including a cancelled copy of the check.  You can also request that your credit report say that your card was closed \"at the consumer's request.\" This will make the situation clear to future lenders. Make a copy of the letter and keep it in a safe place. By doing so you will have complete and reasonable proof that you closed your credit card account. Also be sure to hold onto the certified mail receipt. This will help prove that the credit card company received your letter. Follow up a few weeks later to make sure that your account is indeed closed. Companies may occasionally make mistakes and fail to close your account. The closing process can take up to a month, so don't worry if it isn't closed after a few weeks. If your account has not been closed after a month, though, it's time to take action.  Once closure is confirmed, cut up your credit card to finalize the closure.  You can check whether or not an account has been closed by obtaining a copy of your credit report. Check your credit report a month after you first called to have your card closed. If the card is still active, it is is time to take further action. First, try calling your credit card company again and writing another letter. Wait for a response. If this fails, you can file a dispute through a credit reporting agency (either Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax). Each agency's website has clear instructions on how to do so. If your account is still open after this, you can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at http://www.consumerfinance.gov/Complaint/.",
      "Never try to close a credit card if you still owe money on it. If you want to get rid of a card, stop using it and pay it off before you close the account. You can do this the same way you usually pay your credit card bill. This can be online or by writing a check for the amount owed and mailing it with a copy of your bill to your credit card company. Before closing your card, check online or call in to your lender to check if you have any outstanding rewards balances on your card. You don't want to forgo any potential cash or travel rewards. In some cases, however, this may be unavoidable as rewards may be limited to a certain time of year or value threshold that you haven't yet reached. Take advantage of these rewards if possible, then move on to the next step. You may have to wait on hold for a bit, but this is by far the best way to confirm with a person that your credit card is indeed closed. Tell the company customer service representative that you need to close your card, and be prepared for his attempt to stall you and try to convince you to keep your card. Hold fast, though, and stick to your original intention. The customer service number for your lender is also available on your bill and online. Record your contact with the credit card company. Most companies will give you a service or call number. Write this in addition to the time and date that you spoke to the customer service representative. For extra insurance, record the representative's name and employee number (this is also fairly standard). Your credit card company may try to provide you with an offer to get you to stay. Remember, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to your guns about closing your account, if that's what you want to do. Alternately, you can try bargaining with your provider for lower interest rates and fees. In some cases they may agree to these terms to keep you as a customer.",
      "Think about why you are considering closing the credit card. It may have higher fees than other cards, be specific to a store you don't shop at any more, or may be simply go unused. Whatever the reason, make sure that you want to close this card. Closing a credit card account can be a somewhat trying process and can have a temporary, negative effect on your credit score, so don't take these decisions lightly.  Also be sure not to close all of your credit cards. In theory, this would limit your ability to go into debt, but certain situations call for immediately available credit. You will want to have a sound financial plan, and a large emergency fund in place to avoid debt and high-interest loans. You don't want to have to take out a high-interest loan when you could have used your card. If you are looking to narrow down your credit card collection, close those cards with higher interest rates first. It makes sense to keep those cards with good benefits, but paying exorbitant interest rates when you have the choice not to is a bad idea. The same is true of credit cards with high fees. Identify these cards and cut them out first. Even when a credit card has been closed, the account information will remain on your credit report for quite some time after. Due to specific credit reporting laws, a credit card account in good standing (paid at least minimum amount, no missed payments, etc.) will stay on your report for ten years, while a negative report will stay for seven years. Closing a credit card account can affect your credit score in a number of ways. The effects of doing so are generally not seriously harmful to a person's credit; however, they can cause a brief decrease in your credit score in some cases. Keep in mind that closing a card will never improve your score. Closing a card can affect your score in the following ways:  Reducing your account variation. Credit agencies use a metric that measures how many credit sources you have and their variety (mortgage, car loan, credit card, etc.). Closing a credit card has the potential to decrease this measurement. Reducing the average account age. Another measurement used by credit agencies measures how long you have held certain accounts. If you choose to close an older credit card, the average age of your accounts may decrease, causing a dip in your credit score. Reducing your credit utilization rate. Finally, reporting agencies use a metric called \"credit utilization rate\" that measures how much credit you have vs. how much you use. A lower rate is favorable, but closing a card may significantly increase it. This is a very important factor in determining your credit score, so think about the effect this might have. As previously mentioned, closing a credit card can lead to temporary dip in your credit score. If you planning to make a large purchase, like a car or house, in the near term, think about waiting to close your credit card after you make that purchase. Your temporarily-lower credit score could make your large purchase even more expensive by securing you a higher interest rate on the loan."

      "The best way to show your boyfriend that you love him? Go out together and have a good time as often as you can. It's important to keep a relationship fun and fresh, so make it a priority to date, no matter how long you've been together.  Explore new restaurants, bars, and dance places together. Find out what kinds of things he likes to do and do them with him. Go camping, go hiking, or check out new movies. Head to the comic book shop together. Have mutual interests and explore them together.  Find a sport you both enjoy and pick it up together. Go play tennis against each other, then cool down with some milkshakes afterward. That's a fun, sporty date. On a budget? Make sandwiches and watch a game together, or watch his favorite action movie and spend the night in. Most guys will be huge fans of this kind of date. Let him pick sometimes, as well. It may sound great for you to go to a fancy restaurant and see a ballet, but he might be more into checking out a concert and grabbing some burgers. Do both things, but try to divide them up as much as possible. Your guy will have a close relationship with his guy friends and will show a side of himself that you're not as familiar with. It's possible that he'll act more natural around his male friends, while he'll go into \"boyfriend mode\" when he's with you. If you want to get to know and love the real him, get to know his buddies.  Invite them over for a meal, or to have some beers at your place if you want to entertain. Or come along with him on one of his handouts, if you're invited, and hang out with the guys. If you don't like his friends, that's fine, but try to keep it to yourself as much as possible. Let him hang out with them when he wants, and keep your date time separate. If your guy comes over and you've baked him an apple pie and gotten the UFC pay-per-view? You'll be pretty much the best partner ever. Find out what kinds of things your guy really likes and do them just because, whenever you can.  Bring him lunch at work, or sneak into the shower with him in the morning before he leaves. Let yourself be five minutes late. Surprises for birthdays and other holidays are nice, but they're not really surprises. To really show your guy some love, do it on a typical Wednesday. Surprises will all depend on the guy. Some guys would love it if you just showed up at his place with a pizza, while others might be mortified. Use your own judgment and make sure you know your guy. While it's important to spend lots of time with someone you love, it's also important to spend enough time apart. If you love your boyfriend, let him hang out with his friends and do things alone. Respect his privacy when it comes to alone time.  Some guys will want to hang out every day, while others may require a lot of down time, or time alone. That doesn't mean he loves you less, or that something's wrong. It might just mean that he needs some time alone. If you don't like being alone, then schedule lots of time with your own friends when your guy wants to hang out separately. Hang out with the girls, or see your family for a while. Part of love is trusting your guy enough to tell you the truth. If he hasn't given you any reason to break that trust, you don't need to text him fifty times to keep tabs on him when he's out having fun with his friends. Loving someone means that you get to know them on an emotional level that's deep, maybe deeper than you've ever known someone before. If you want to learn to love your boyfriend, it's important to spend lots of time talking. Ask him open-ended questions to get him talking and listen. See what he has to say. See what he's like. Get to know him.  While guys have a reputation for being silent, most guys will open up when you get them in private and talk about the right things. Talking about his hopes and dreams and emotions? Not so much. Talking about subjects he's passionate about? Now you're talking. If this is your first relationship, spend lots of time talking to your boyfriend and getting to know him before you do anything you won't be able to take back. Don't have sex or send inappropriate pictures to anyone you don't really know, just because your'e \"going out.\"",
      "Your relationship should be a source of joy and love, not a wrestling match between two angry scorpions who are trapped together. If you want to cultivate a loving and close relationship with your boyfriend, it's important to try to keep things as positive and loving as possible at all times.  Tell him regularly what you like about him. Write down a list of the things that you love about your boyfriend and that you're attracted to. This helps you to remind yourself as well, if you've forgotten. When bad things happen, as they will, try to handle them like an adult. If you have an argument, try not to scream and yell, but calm down and take a break if necessary. Talk about things when you're in a calm mood. If you want to love your guy, then be in his corner. If he's having a rough time at school or work, encourage him to do his best. If he's successful, compliment him and remind him that he's doing a good job. Be a positive presence in his life. Sometimes, encouragement should be hard. If your guy's been doing nothing but slugging brews and playing Xbox lately, then maybe he needs to be encouraged to spend his time a little more wisely. Talk with him about what he wants to do and encourage him in his interests, so he'll be more fulfilled. Try to avoid nagging or criticizing your guy, especially if he's having a rough time. Most guys will respond better to positive encouragement than to negatives. If your guy is doing something you don't like, give him the hint by suggesting different ways of doing things, instead of rubbing his face in his failures. Guys appreciate it when you cut to the chase and speak your mind. If you have an opinion about something, share it. If you're angry, say so. If something turns you on, tell him what it is so he'll do it again. Don't try to be subtle with a guy, just come right out and say it. Learn to recognize his personal signals. Some guys will close down and stop talking if they're upset. That doesn't mean you need to ask \"What's the matter?\" fifty times an hour. Some guys will open up if you give them some space. Don't expect him to read your mind. If you're feeling hurt by something he said, don't just give him the silent treatment and expect him to figure it out. Be clear and be open. Be honest with him. That's a lot better than sneaking around and trying to drop hints. One thing that helps a guy feel valuable and loved is to feel useful. Asking him to help you with things you don't need help with might just come off as annoying. It's a lot easier to love someone if you're seeing him at his best. If you know you're going to hate going to the football game with him and watching him scream and yell while you're bored, don't tag along just to be together. Spend your time doing something else instead and be together when you've got your own date time. Don't force him to do things he doesn't want to do. If he's going to gripe and complain to come along to an office party with you, don't drag him along. You'll have more fun alone.",
      "It's important to open yourself up to love and affection. Try to let go of anxiety and love yourself as you love your boyfriend. If you have issues with anxiety and self-esteem, it's important to work on those issues separately from your relationship with your boyfriend.  If you struggle with anxiety issues, or struggle in other ways, talk to someone about it. Seek out a doctor, or a close friend to talk about your anxiety. You can be open and honest with your boyfriend, but don't burden him with your issues if it hurts your relationship.  Look your best so you feel confident and loving with your boyfriend. You don't have to look any particular way to love your boyfriend, but if it would make you feel more confident and loving with your boyfriend, make some little changes. Get in shape or dress up if it will help. Before you're physically intimate with your boyfriend, make sure that you want to and that you're old enough and responsible enough to show your love physically. Always practice safe sex and communicate with your boyfriend before you do. If your boyfriend will only be with you if you have sex before you're ready, or send him pictures on your phone that you don't want to send, break up with him. He's manipulating you and is being unfair. Love yourself enough to stand up for yourself and move at your own speed. Lots of people think that the guy will always initiate the kissing and the physical love part of a relationship. This doesn't have to be the case. If you want to show your boyfriend that you love him, don't wait around for him to make a move. If you're feeling love, make a move yourself every now and then. This will help him to feel loved, and will help you to feel closer to him. Even if you've been together a while, try to remember what it was like when you first got together and rekindle some of that attitude when you're together. Tell him that he turns you on. Tell him what you want to do together.  Leave him little notes throughout the day if you want to turn your boyfriend on. Delay the gratification, so you'll keep the sexual tension up all day until you get back to your place.  Tease him physically as well. Give him a little kiss on the side of the neck when you're out in public together and whisper in his ear. Drive him wild. Your love life can get stale pretty quickly if you don't put some work into it. If you want to love your boyfriend, find little ways to keep your life in and out of the bedroom fresh and exciting for you.  Try having sex at different times and in different places than normal. If you want to do it, don't always do it in the same place. Try out new moves. Experiment with some kink. Dress up and role-play. Talk about what you like, and find out what he likes. All guys are different. It's always better to find out from your boyfriend what feels good and what turns him on, instead of reading some list on the Internet or from a magazine."

    ],
    "document": [
      "Choose a mild soap and gently wash your vaginal area. Make sure your hands are washed in the process. Rinse the soap off completely. Pat your the skin of your hands and vagina dry using a clean cotton cloth. Always use sanitary tools and wash your hands before applying the cream. This can prevent bacteria from spreading into your vagina. The tube of cream should come with an applicator that you can screw it onto. Gently squeeze the tube from the bottom so that the applicator is filled with the correct dosage. Look for a fill mark on the applicator or fill the applicator completely, if instructed. Don't overfill the applicator since you'll need to unscrew the applicator from the tube. Hold the applicator upright so that none of the cream leaks out. Avoid screwing the applicator and the tube too tight. You'll need to be able to get the tube of cream out of the applicator for future use. Stand with your legs and knees apart. Place one foot up on a stool, the edge of the toilet, the bathtub or a chair. Or, you could lay on your back with your knees bent and your feet about shoulder width apart. You should be somewhat comfortable and have easy access to your vaginal opening. Take your non-dominant hand and separate the lips of your vulva (the labia) so that your vagina is exposed. Your dominant hand should be holding the applicator filled with cream. Relax and place the applicator into your vaginal opening. Insert it in your vagina and depress the plunger of the applicator using your index finger. Depress the plunger completely so that it stops moving and all the cream is inserted. It may help to point the applicator towards the small of your back when you place it into your vaginal opening. Remove the applicator and dispose of it if you won't need it again. If you used a reusable applicator, wash it with warm soapy water. Rinse it well and let it air dry completely. Remember to wash and dry your hands. Since some of the cream may leak out, you might want to wear a sanitary pad (not a tampon) to collect any discharge.",
      "You should use the vaginal cream for the full number of days prescribed at the correct dose. Don't stop using the vaginal cream if you start menstruating. The vaginal cream will still be effective; it just may be a little messier to insert. Just make sure to use sanitary pads since tampons could absorb the cream. If you miss a dose or run out of the vaginal cream before your treatment is complete, call the doctor or pharmacist for a refill. Most vaginal creams are designed to be stored at room temperature. Check the information on the box or ask your pharmacist to be sure. Storing the cream at a temperature that's too hot or cold could damage it. It's best to store most medications in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing medication in a medicine cabinet since heat and moisture from the bathroom could cause it to be less effective or expire early. The heat of your body will cause most creams to leak out a little after you apply them to your vagina. If you can, try to use the vaginal cream at night. Laying down after you apply the cream can also keep it in your vagina longer and reduce the amount that leaks out. If you need to use vaginal creams during the day, wear a sanitary pad to avoid staining your underwear and lay down for a few minutes immediately after you apply the cream, if you can. The side effects will vary depending on what medication is in the vaginal cream. In general, side effects may include vaginal discomfort, vaginal dryness, burning or itching and potentially messy discharge from the vagina. Be sure to read the information that came with the vaginal cream. This will give you more detailed information about the specific side effects you can expect. If any side effects are causing you discomfort or you feel pain, contact your doctor. If you experience swelling of the vagina and vulva area, itching, hives, or tightness of the chest, you may be having an allergic reaction so it's important to get medication attention. Always ask your doctor if you have any questions about using the vaginal cream. You should also talk with your doctor about whether or not you need to refrain from sexual intercourse while you use the vaginal cream."

      "You need to get your hair wet before styling it. Either take a shower and pat your hair partially dry, or scoop some water up in your hand and run it through your hair. Squeeze a quarter-sized dollop of product into your hand and rub the cream or mousse throughout your hair. Make sure to rub the sides and back of your head as well. This is a simple, classy look that will work for job interviews and nights out on the town alike. It works with almost any head shape, and can be easily adjusted to be more or less formal. You can part your hair either on the left or right side of your head. Some people have a natural part, where their hair tends to naturally lean one direction or another. If you have a natural part, use it to make parting your hair easier. If you don’t, pick whichever side you think will look better based on the shape of your head. The part belongs at the upper-right or upper-left as the side of your hair transitions into the top of the head where the hair gets thicker. With the product still wet, take your comb and start at the point in your head where you want to put your part. Put the comb’s teeth right on to the line where you’re adding the part and comb the top over the center of your head. Comb your hair to the side, running the comb in the same direction away from the part. The part line should look like a single, continuous line on the top of your head. Your sides won’t require as much combing as your top, but they do need to be combed flat. Use the same comb to smooth the hair on the sides of your head straight down. Be careful on the side that you already parted so that you don’t brush any of the hairs from the top. Don’t use a dryer on the side-part. It’ll just lift individual hairs up from the area where you parted your hair and you’ll look messy.",
      "Run your hands under a stream of water and then run your fingers through your hair to get it wet. You can also choose to take a shower and blot your hair mostly dry with a towel. Scoop up a quarter-sized amount of product in your hand and work it into your hair by running your hands through the top of your head. Start with the roots of your hair and run your hands backwards to spread the product out.  This cut is a great look for men with shorter hair on the side who want a defined, simple look that will look natural and curated at the same time. You don’t need much product to shape your hair. If you use more than a small dollop, you may end up with chunks of product stuck in your hair. Plug a dryer in and turn it on low. Spread your fingers out and brush your hair back over and over. At the same time, dry your hair from the left of the right side of your head. The direction that you’re drying from will determine what side of your hair moves up towards the peak in the front. If you have longer hair on the side, comb it or pat it down so that it isn’t sticking out at the side. Starting at the edge of the crown, direct the hair in the front half of your head straight up and toward the center of your skull. The hair at the top front should meet in a point aligned to the middle of the crown. Plug a flat iron in and set it to low heat if there are adjustable settings. Clamp the iron over the peaks where the 2 sides of your hair meet at the top for 1-2 seconds. This will heat the edges and merge them together so that your peak stays in place for the day. This step is optional, you can always choose to leave it as it is. The peak is more likely to hold in place if you iron the tips though. Scoop up a small amount of styling product in your hand. Rub your hands together to spread the product through your fingers. Pat the sides of your crown and the tips of your hair where the 2 sides meet to set the hair in place.",
      "Hair gel is the most common hair product for a reason—it tends to be the strongest. If you have very specific styles in mind and plan on spending a lot of time outdoors or running around, get a gel to shape your hair. Most gels tend to leave a shiny texture behind. This can make your hair look a little damp if you use too much of it. Hair wax and mud are thicker than gel, and tend to provide a solid amount of holding power. The major difference is that hair wax or mud doesn’t leave a ton of shine behind. This is the best choice if you aren’t actually trying to look like you spent a lot of time on your hair, since it will be kind of hard to tell that you actually used anything in it.  These products are sometimes called hair clay as well. Wax, unlike gel or pomade, can be adjusted after it’s been dried and your hair will still hold. Pomade has become one of the most beloved hair products for men over the course of the past few years. It’s popular because it provides some light holding power without leaving a ton of evidence that you’ve put product in your hair. It won’t hold your hair firmly in place, but it will help keep a general shape once it’s in your hair. Pomade is thicker than wax, but doesn’t hold as hard. This makes it a great option for people with thicker hair that doesn’t need as much help holding a shape. While not as popular for men, volumizing mousse will make your hair pop out and stand up. This is a great choice for people with thinner hair that tends to fall down after it’s been styled with thicker products.",
      "You need to get your hair wet before you can style a pompadour. Take a shower and blot your hair with a towel to get rid of the excess water. You can also choose to run your hands under some water and run your fingers through your hair. Squeeze a quarter-sized dollop of product into your palm. Then, gently rub the product over your hands and spread it evenly through your hair from root to end. This is kind of an old-school look that has become quite popular over the past 5-10 years. It’s a great way to make short hair look bigger than it actually is, although it will be hard to pull off if the front of your hair is tapered to be shorter than the top of your head. Plug a hair dryer in and set it to low heat. Run your fingers through your hair and push the front of your hair upwards then back while drying it from the front. Focus on giving the hair height during this step. Once the roots of your locks dry vertically, you can ease the ends of the hair toward the back of your head. Once you’ve got the top of your hair lifted and pulled to the back, grab a comb or stiff brush. Use the comb or brush to comb your sides backwards. While you’re combing, dry your sides with the hair dryer set on low heat. Once your hair dries, scoop up a small amount of styling product in your hand. Rub your hands together to spread it out and then run your fingers lightly through the top of your hair. Adjust the shape of the top of your pompadour to modify your look and set your hair in place.  Don’t change the overall direction of your hair after you’ve dried it. You won’t be able to add parts or set sections to the side after the hair has dried. Add details or change small elements with a comb if you’d like.",
      "Either take a shower and pat your hair mostly dry, or scoop some water up and run it through your hair. Pat your hair down with a damp towel to remove most of the water. Take some sculpting wax, gel, mud, or pomade and run it through your hair. Make sure that you rub the sides and the back to get product into every part of your hair. The crew cut is an extremely common haircut where the sides are cut extremely short and there’s a little more hair left on top. Since you can’t do much with the sides, styling a crew cut comes down to adjusting the hair on top. For a trendier look, take a fine-tooth comb and place the teeth directly underneath your hairline in front. Comb your hair directly to the back on top. Comb the top section of your head straight back and comb the sides down for a vintage undercut style. To give your crew cut a little attitude, scoop a quarter-sized drop of product into your hands. Put both hands on top of your head inside the part. Use your fingers to rub your hair on both sides up and towards the center. Squeeze the crown of your hair together to set it in place. If you want to add a little volume without making too much of a statement, take a comb or brush and style the top of your head forward. With the top of your head brushed or combed forward, take your hand and run it up through the top of your head in the front. Pull the hair near your hairline up with your fingers and make minor adjustments by hand to give your hair some shape. This will give your hair a little volume without making it look overly-styled. For a laid-back bed head look, simply use your hands to rub the top of your head and mess your hair up. Then, once your hair is all over the place, make minor adjustments by hand or with a soft-bristled brush to adjust the hair as you please. If you want to set your messy look in place, use a sculpting spray to set it in place."

      "Whether you hit the snooze button constantly in the morning, or even only delaying getting up by five minutes, using the snooze button at all will make you feel more tired.  Sleep experts say that hitting the snooze button disrupts the inertia of your sleep, which in turn will make you feel (and look!) more tired throughout the morning.  When you first wake up in the morning and feel like you want to go back to sleep, that is normal sleep inertia; however, allowing your body to go back to sleep and having to repeat the process again a few minutes later will cause your brain to feel this pronounced grogginess longer after you do finally get up.  If you want to feel and look more awake right away, avoid post-snooze sleep and the snooze button! Your body’s internal clock is extremely sensitive to light and darkness, so try to avoid confusing it by telling it to be awake when you’re still in the dark.  A hefty dose of sunshine when you first wake up in the morning is one of the best ways to trick your body into waking up.  And if you feel like you’re awake, you will look like you’re awake.  If you open the curtains to overcast skies or you wake up before dawn, turn on a very strong light in every room you get ready in.  For best results, try using the type of lightbulb used to treat the seasonal affective disorder. If you have the willpower to wake up and do your full workout, that’s great!  For many people though, just getting up in the morning is hard enough.  Even if you feel extremely tired in the morning, another great way to perk up your appearance is to get the blood moving by taking a brisk walk around your room, doing a couple of jumping jacks, or stretching for about 5 minutes.  This light exercise and stretching will help wake up your mind and body, and it will give you an alert look and a rosy, healthy glow. When you wake up feeling tired it can be tempting to skip the shower altogether for a few extra minutes of sleep; however, taking a shower is a great way to wake up in the morning.  Adjust the water temperature to be as cool as you can handle it, and use an exfoliating scrub on your face and body.  Exfoliating will scrub off the grime and bacteria from the previous day and brighten the skin, which will help you look more awake.  Coldwater also causes the blood vessels to constrict, which reduces redness and swelling, so your face will look more rested.  Be sure to put moisturizer on afterward since dehydrated skin will look unhealthy and make you look tired. Sleep experts say that waking up and immediately reaching for your coffee is one of the worst ways to wake up.  It gets your body in the habit of needing caffeine and makes your body think that it can’t possibly wake up without it when in fact it can.  This means that on days when you don’t have enough coffee or any coffee at all, you will look way more tired than you really are because you’ve tricked yourself into thinking you’re sleepy.  Instead, reach for a large glass of cold water and drink it briskly.  This will wake you up and hydrate your skin, helping you look awake.  Also don’t forget to eat breakfast rich in fiber and protein, which will set you up for a day of productivity.",
      "It may seem strange, but one of the most tried and true remedies to look awake and refreshed in the morning is to use cold spoons to de-puff your eyes.  Place two spoons in your freezer while you get ready in the morning.  Once they have cooled, gently press the spoons (the curved side in) to your eye sockets.  The combination of the cold and the pressure will make under-eye bags disappear, which will make you look wide awake and well-rested.  Keep the spoons on your eyes until they are no longer cold, about 5 minutes. Red eyes are a sure sign that you are fatigued, so taking measures to make your eyes look white will immediately make you look less tired.  There are several ways to do this depending on how much extra time you have in the morning:  Use over-the-counter eye drops to clear up bloodshot eyes. Apply a cold compress to your eyes for 10 - 15 minutes in the morning to help shrink the blood vessels around your eyes. If you wear makeup, apply eyeliner that matches your skin tone to the inner lash line, called the waterline, of your lower eyelid. This will make the veins in your eyes less noticeable and the whites of your eyes will look brighter. Many people suffer from dark under-eye circles even when they are well-rested, but still, these circles are associated with fatigue.  In fact, dark under-eye circles are not caused by a lack of sleep, these shadows are just more apparent when you’re tired because a lack of sleep makes you paler and more hollow-eyed.  Whether the circles are chronic or because you pulled an all-nighter, there are ways to reduce their appearance and help you look less tired:  Applying cold compresses (especially cold spoons!) will help get rid of dark circles as well as puffy eyes. Try using saline washes or sprays to rinse away any nasal congestion, which can affect your blood pressure and pool blood in the veins and capillaries under your eyes. Take a moment and gently massage your under-eye area with a cool wet washcloth or a frozen cotton swab for about 5 - 10 minutes.  This will help disperse any blood pooled in the veins and capillaries under your eyes. If you wear makeup, use a thick concealer with a yellow undertone to hide dark under-eye circles. On days where you need a little more help to look less tired in the morning, reach for a moisturizing product designed to perk up your skin.  Look for products that contain refreshing ingredients like caffeine or green tea, which will help awaken your skin up from the inside out.  To enhance the effectiveness of these products further, try keeping them in the refrigerator to that they are extra cool and refresh when applied to the skin.",
      "Staying hydrated throughout the day will help you look better and feel better.  Going to bed even mildly dehydrated will not only disturb your sleep cycle, but it will also cause you to look more tired in the morning.  Staying hydrated will help your skin achieve an even tone and can help you avoid dark under-eye circles, which will make you look tired even if you had a full night of deep sleep. If drinking more water throughout the day makes you get up to use the restroom at night, drink earlier in the day and stop drinking water two hours before bedtime. Both caffeine and alcohol are extremely dehydrating, so drinking too much of either throughout the day can counteract all the water you drink to stay hydrated.  Alcohol also causes the blood vessels in your body and face to dilate, which can lead to flushed, puffy skin when you wake up in the morning.  Drinking either of these before bed will make you look even more tired in the morning, so definitely avoid these the night before any important day. Feeling and looking tired in the morning can be caused by a number of factors, but one of the most common factors is poor sleep hygiene.  Sleeping well is not just about how long you sleep, it is also about how well you sleep.  Many people just jump into bed and shut the light off, but this is not the proper way to wind down after a long day.  Before settling in for the night, try to take the time to clear your mind of any stressors.  Be sure to turn off the TV and any bright lights as well.  Maximize the benefits of sleep by helping your brain get to the ultra-relaxing deep sleep stage by starting your night off with a relaxed mind. Most sleep experts agree that the average adult should get 7 - 9 hours of sleep each night.  For many, this number may seem like a lot, but that’s because hardly any adults get that much sleep.  In fact, about 40% of adults get less than 7 hours of sleep each night.  Sleep experts say this means that almost half of adults are starving for sleep, so it’s no wonder so many of us feel and look tired in the morning.  To help you look less tired in the morning, be less tired in the morning by getting enough sleep the night before.  Stick to a consistent bedtime to help set your body’s internal clock, and you’ll be on your way to a fresh face in the morning in no time. Stop using electronic screens about an hour before going to sleep. Screens interrupt the cues that tell your body that it's time to get some shut-eye, and tapering off on their use before going to sleep will make it easier to get a good night's rest. To help you look your best in the morning, experts also recommend sleeping on your back to reduce sleep lines upon awakening.  Sleeping on your back can also help to reduce face puffiness and the formation of early-onset wrinkles.  You can also try sleeping with more pillows under your head, propping up your body at a 25-30 degree angle, which some research finds reduces dark circles formation by eliminating blood pooling in the tiny vessels of the face during sleep."

      "Keeping Track of Your Bills"
    ],
    "document": [
      "It sounds easier said than done, but the way to start is by separating your bills into three categories: necessities, secured debts, and unsecured debts.  Necessities are the types of bills you need to pay in order to survive. Thing like mortgage or rent, your utility bills, your grocery bills, and any bills that allow you to work, such as child care or car payments. A secured debt is a debt that is secured by some type of collateral. That means that if the debt goes unpaid, then the creditor can repossess whatever you have as collateral without first taking you to court. This includes mortgage and car payments (which are also necessities), as well as child support (which uses your wages as collateral) and back taxes. After you've paid off your necessities, pay these.  Lastly, pay your unsecured debts. In order for a creditor to seize your property in order to satisfy an unsecured debt, they first have to take you to court. Since it takes a long time for a court case to come to bar, even if you get behind on these debts, you will have more time make things right with your creditors than you do with secured debts and necessities. Try to pay big, irregular bills over several monthly if you can't pay all at once. You may be able to negotiate with your creditor to space out your payments. Either way, it's better to pay what you can rather than nothing at all. Of course, this is the last thing you want to do. But if you are coming up short every month, you may need to make some cuts in recurring expenses. You may have to cut off your cable or smartphone (get a flip-phone instead), or liquidate assets until you get back on your feet. Many lenders or utility companies, for instance, will work with you to negotiate lower bill payments if you're in a bind. For example you can opt for a higher deductible on your auto insurance or shop around for cheaper insurance that fits into your budget. Contact a nonprofit credit counseling or financial planning organization. Counselors can help you set up a budget and can negotiate with creditors on your behalf. The Justice Department keeps a list of approved credit counseling agencies here: http://www.justice.gov/ust/list-credit-counseling-agencies-approved-pursuant-11-usc-111, but others are available.  There are a fair amount of charlatans hawking credit counseling advice, so be cautious when choosing one. Make sure they are non-profit, ask about the qualifications of their counselors, fees, contract terms, and how their counselors get paid.",
      "This is one of the easiest ways to make a budget that you stick to. Simply compute how much you pay each month for your regular bills. Divide that amount by the number of times you get paid each month to determine how much you should deposit in your bill-paying account from each paycheck. After each pay period, make sure to make the deposits in the proper accounts. Certain items, like car registration, taxes, and insurance payments are often billed once or twice a year, instead of being billed each month. Budget for these too. Simply write down the total of your non-regular bills and divide that number by 12 to determine how much to set aside each month.  So that you won't be tempted to skimp on irregular expenses, it's best to put this money in the same account as you use for your regular bills. That way, the money is there when you need it. Budget for items that you may not buy monthly, such as clothing, so that you always have some money tucked away when you need new items. This is very important, and most financial experts strongly recommend building emergency savings equal to three to six months of take-home income. As soon as you are caught up on bills, this should be your first savings goal. The amount you need to put in will depend on your needs.  For example, if your car insurance policy has a $1,000 deductible, then always keep at least $1,000 in your emergency account just in case you have a car accident.",
      "If you get paper copies of your bills in the mail, open them immediately. When you're behind on bills, it can be tempting not to open them. Resist the urge. There is nothing to be gained by keeping yourself in the dark. Even people who have paperless billing set up will put off opening bills. For a lot of people, it can be easier to postpone looking at their bills if they can't see them hanging around the house. If this sounds like you, switch from paperless billing to conventional billing. This might seem like a no-brainer, but that doesn't mean that everyone does it. Even people who know they should do this sometimes don't. Make a commitment to keep all of your bills in the same place, so that you go straight there from the mailbox. Try a home office, the refrigerator door, or a coffee table — just make sure that it's a place where you see them often enough that you don't forget. The easiest way to keep track of bills is to pay them as they arrive. That way, you never need to worry about paying bills late, and you never have to worry about overspending on non-essentials. The money you can't afford to spend is already spent where it is most necessary. Even if you pay each bill as it comes, every now and then, there will be a bill you can't afford to pay right away. When this happens, put the bill in one of two categories: bills that are due at the beginning of the month, and bills that are due mid-month. Pay the bills that are due at the beginning of the month first, and pay the mid-month bills second. Your goal is to owe roughly the same amount at the beginning of the month and in the middle of the month. Almost all companies will negotiate a more convenient due date if you ask. So if one segment of your bills is much larger than the other, call customer service for the respective companies and ask them to change your billing date. For the technologically averse, mark two dates on your calendar for bill payment. Each bill payment date should come a little bit before the bills are actually due. For example, on the 1st and 15th of each month, set aside an hour or so to both review and settle your bills. Make sure to keep this appointment with yourself. If you find yourself needing a more noticeable reminder than a calendar, try a bill payment app or website. Some common features include automatically linking to debit and credit cards, reminders when a bill is about to be late, and alerts when your bank account gets low. There are a lot of great apps and sites out there, but check out Mint Bills, Prism Bills and Money, and Evolve Money for a start. Online bill pay will automatically draft your bill payments from your checking account. You won't have to worry about keeping your bills organized or remembering to write and mail a check. You can set up an online bill pay through one of the secondary sites or apps available online, or you can set it up automatically with the companies who are billing you."

      "Make sure you add a picture of your face and a brief biography that explains what you like and what you do. Include your website and your city location. Many people do not follow Twitter users who don't use a photo of themselves as their picture. This is because Twitter-based spammers often use other images, rather than personal photos. This is the bar at the top of your profile with a small magnifying glass in it. Search for friends, family and famous people you may want to follow. Send them a message by including \"@\" in front of their username to introduce yourself and encourage them to follow you. Add them to lists, if you want to make your followers more manageable.  Do your research on each user before following them. Click on the profile and read their tweets. Send them a message if you know them already to encourage them to follow you back. Many people receive updates when new people follow them on Twitter. This is a notifications setting in your personal profile. In some cases, if you start following someone, they will start following you, and you can begin talking with them regularly on Twitter. It will list people your friends follow or people with similar interests. Click on their name to go to their Twitter profile, and follow them if you read their tweets and like what you see. This trend started in 2009, and it encourages people to recommend their favorite Twitter users by putting @username and \"#followfriday\" or \"#ff\" at the end. You can click on the hashtag to see all the people who are recommended in the Twitter feed on Friday. Also pay attention to other peoples' lists that recommend people. They might be named \"Tweeps I suggest,\" or something similar. This is another great way to look for good people to follow and connect with. Search for users with a tag of your choice, such as \"books,\" \"San Francisco\" or \"marketing.\" When you follow them, reply to their tweets or retweet them to begin the connection.  Decide what kind of connections you want to make on Twitter. You may want to develop professional, community, business or personal contacts. The type of user you want to meet will define how professional or personal your communication should be. Directories are great places to find the most influential Twitter users so that you can stay on top of trends and news. You may not make close connections with people who have thousands or millions of followers.",
      "As well as retweeting a message, choose to include a reply \"@theirusername\" and say \"thanks, I loved this\" or a similar comment. This is a great way to achieve a more personal connection and get the person to follow you, if they don't do so already. Everyone loves knowing that their tweets are reaching their followers and being appreciated. Just like regular friends, Twitter friendships and connections get stronger the more consistently you interact. Become part of conversations with people you follow, and you will begin to connect. Direct messages are private messages between two users, invisible to the public. Use this to communicate with close friends, family colleagues and people you have developed close connections with.  Direct messages that are sent to people you don't know very well may go unanswered. However, if you are trying to arrange a business meeting or ask for advice, it may be a way to get to know someone better. Never ask for personal information, or you may be reported as a Twitter spammer. You can only send direct messages to users who are following you. TweetDeck is a popular Internet, iPad and phone application because it displays the homepage, replies and direct messages in a user-friendly way."

      "Mustard greens should be harvested when the leaves are still young and tender; older leaves will have a bitterer flavor. You can start to pick the leaves after 4 weeks, when they should be about 3 to 6 inches long (7.6-15.2cm).  You can harvest greens by snipping off outer leaves from the plant, and then leaving it to continue growing. Alternatively, you can unearth the entire plant and harvest all of the leaves at once. Discard any yellow leaves that you find on the plant. Pick all your mustard greens and refrigerate them. Leaves can be kept in the crisper drawer for up to a week. Beyond that, you can freeze the greens to be used for cooking later on. When the environment gets too hot, the plants will begin to seed and grow a flower stalk, signaling that no new leaves will grow. At this point you can either dig up the plants, or leave them there to seed. Once the seed pod developing on the plant has dried, you can collect the seeds. Be sure to collect them before the seed pod splits open; seeds that spill onto the soil will likely be dispersed and grow into new plants later on.",
      "Mustard greens come in different varieties ranging in color, texture, and shape of leaves.  These varying types of mustard greens come from different regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Southeastern US. To create an interesting mix, plant two or more of these varieties:  Ruby Streaks Red Giant Scarlet frills Southern Giant Curled Golden Frills Amara Red Giant Garnet Giant Red Splendor Suehlihung No. 2 Purchase seeds for growing mustard greens from a local gardening center, online, at hardware stores, or at department stores. Given the quick growth cycle of mustard greens, you can replant them every two or three weeks to keep up production. If you intend to do so, purchase more accordingly. Mustard greens grow best in moist, rich soil. To prepare the soil for planting, spread compost over the planting area, about 3 to 6 inches thick. Carefully turn the compost into the ground with a digging fork, loosening the soil. Mustard greens thrive in cooler temperatures but do not grow well in summer. Aim to start seeds about four weeks before the last frost. The plants can tolerate frost, which actually contributes to a sweeter flavor to the greens. Plant seeds just under the soil, about a half an inch apart. Once the seedlings sprout and grow their first leaves, gently unearth them and pull them apart into clumps. Replant the seedlings approximately 12 inches apart. While this replanting of the seedlings is not necessary, doing so will allow greens to grow faster and yield more.",
      "Mustard greens require 2 inches of water per week to thrive. Factoring in rainfall, make sure that they receive adequate hydration. Be sure to keep the soil evenly and consistently watered. Carefully remove any weeds you see growing around your plants. While mustard greens do not require a lot of room to grow, the influx of weeds can cause unnecessary disturbance, particularly to fragile seedlings. To remove weeds, softly dig them out with your hands, ensuring that the roots are removed as well. To ensure the successful growth of your mustard greens, protect them from bugs that might feed on them (e.g. cabbage worms, cabbage loopers, and flea beetles). Cover plants with row cover fabric, available for purchase at most gardening centers.  Since the insects can't reach the plant under the fabric, they can't feed on it, or lay eggs to reproduce.  Make sure that you keep track of the temperature and moisture levels in your covered rows. Enclosed growing areas can get too hot for greens, so it is important to monitor the plants closely. Avoid getting the leaves wet every time you water your mustard greens. This will help to reduce the risk of your mustard greens getting downy mildew."

      "Skunks like to hole up under decks, sheds, porches, and crawl spaces. To prevent this from happening, seal off any open areas with chicken wire fencing. To keep skunks from digging or squeezing under, you’ll need to make sure the chicken wire extends at least 1 foot (30 cm) under the ground.  If there’s already a skunk living under your deck or another structure on your property, you will need to scare it out before sealing the area off. Try encouraging the skunk to leave by setting up a bright light or an ultrasonic deterrent to frighten it away.  Before setting up any deterrents, wait until you’re pretty sure the skunk is away from its den. If you have a backyard shed, garage, or other outbuilding that a skunk can easily wander into, close it up and secure any possible entrances. Otherwise, skunks may come in to seek shelter or look for food. Check for holes or gaps that a skunk could get into and seal them off with wire mesh or another suitable material, such as cement or plaster. Piles of debris make tempting shelters for skunks. If you suspect you have a skunk in your yard, clear away any large piles of rocks, sticks, wood, junk, or lawn waste that it could be hiding under.  If you keep a firewood pile in your yard and are concerned about skunks denning under it, try putting a fence around it or spraying the area with a skunk deterrent, such as a castor oil spray or a commercial skunk repellent. You can also store cut lumber or firewood in a closed shed or other outbuilding, if you have one. If you find a suspected skunk den, loosely fill the hole with a light material, such as dead leaves, straw, crumpled paper, or dirt. If the den is occupied, the skunk will be able to push its way out. If the material remains undisturbed for 2-3 days, you can assume the den is unoccupied and seal it off more permanently, e.g., by blocking it off with wire.  If the den is still occupied, one option is to install a 1-way door at the entrance to the den. This device will allow skunks to leave the den, but they will not be able to go back inside once they’ve left. You can buy 1-way animal doors online or from many home or garden supply stores. You can also try scaring any current occupants out of the den with a natural repellent or a sound or light deterrent. Skunks are a major barnyard pest due to their tendency to raid chicken coops and eat the eggs. If you keep chickens or other livestock that skunks might be interested in, secure the area by putting wire fencing around the coop. Make sure the wire extends at least 8 inches (20 cm) under the ground around the coop. Ideally, it should also extend horizontally away from the enclosure another 8 inches (20 cm), so that it forms an L shape. Skunks also like to eat bees and their larvae. If you keep bees, keep the hives elevated so that skunks can’t easily reach them. Skunks like to den under bushes and shrubs. If you have any plants in your yard with low-hanging branches, prune them back so they don’t offer as much shelter. If you have any fallen trees or branches in your yard, remove those promptly so that they don’t provide easy shelter for skunks.",
      "Skunks dislike the smell of castor oil. You can easily make a safe and natural skunk deterrent by mixing 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of castor oil, 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of liquid dish detergent, and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water and putting the mixture in a spray bottle or canister. Spray the mixture around a suspected skunk den or any areas where you think skunks are messing around on your property. You can also use capsaicin oil, or hot pepper spray, to deter skunks. However, these sprays can be very irritating to both humans and animals, so take care when using them. Bright, flashing lights are alarming to skunks, and can be an effective deterrent in dens and garden areas and around animal enclosures or trash cans. Look for a light-based animal deterrent and set it up in an area where skunks are active. You can also use repellents that emit loud or high-pitched noises, or even use something like a portable radio to play noise that skunks will find unpleasant. You can buy light and sound-based outdoor animal deterrents online or at most home or garden supply stores. Sprinklers can startle skunks and scare them away. Place a motion-activated sprinkler in an area where skunks are likely to cause trouble, such as next to your vegetable garden. If you happen to catch a skunk in action, you can also try blasting it with a garden hose from a safe distance. Urine-based repellents, usually made with the urine of dogs or coyotes, can also be effective at scaring away skunks. You can buy these repellents online or at a home or garden supply store or sporting goods store. Spray them around suspected dens or in other areas where you want to keep skunks away.  If you choose to use a urine-based repellent, research the company that produces it to make sure they use humane practices when collecting the urine. You may also be able to scare skunks away by sprinkling a little used kitty litter in problem areas, such as around the entrances to dens. Many smells that are designed to appeal to humans are unpleasant to skunks. One simple and gentle method for deterring skunks is to place strongly scented household products in areas where they like to forage. Try putting some perfumed bars of soap or room deodorizers around the area. You can also try placing orange peels or rags soaked with ammonia in the area.",
      "Like many wild animals, skunks will happily scavenge human food garbage if you leave it where they can get at it. If you put your garbage outside, choose sturdy containers with lids that close securely, so that skunks and other nighttime visitors can’t knock them over or climb inside for a snack. Don’t leave any exposed food garbage outdoors. For example, if you have a backyard barbeque or picnic, throw away any trash and scraps when you’re done. If you have dogs, cats, or other pets that go outside, feed them indoors as much as possible. Otherwise, skunks may be attracted by uneaten food in their dishes. If you feed your pets outdoors, bring the food dishes in at night or as soon as your pet is finished eating. If you have bird feeders in your yard or garden, skunks may be attracted to seed that the birds spill on the ground. One way to minimize the amount of seed that falls is to attach a tray or tub to the bottom of the bird feeder to catch any seed that falls out. Just make sure to empty the tray frequently so it doesn’t overflow.  If possible, choose a tray with a mesh bottom so that it will catch falling seeds but not become waterlogged if it rains. You can also minimize spillage by filling each feeder with a single type of seed. That way, birds won’t make a mess by picking out and discarding the seeds they don’t like. Skunks love to eat grubs, so managing a grub problem is a good way to make your yard or garden less attractive to them. You can try treating your lawn with milky spore powder, a natural pesticide available in most home or garden supply stores, in the late summer or early autumn. Another option is to mix up a solution of 1 part children’s shampoo to 1 part household ammonia and spray it on your lawn. In addition to killing the grubs, this solution can also help fertilize your lawn. The odor of the ammonia may also discourage skunks! Skunks are omnivores, meaning they will eat fruit and nuts as well as insects and other small animals. If you have any trees in your yard that produce fruit, berries, or nuts, pick up anything that falls out of the tree promptly. You might find it helpful to rake your yard to more easily remove any edible debris.  Try to pick ripe fruit or nuts from trees promptly before they fall on their own. If you have a garden, harvest any fruits and vegetables as they become ripe. Most skunks aren’t good climbers, so they’re unlikely to be able to get at fruit that’s still in the tree."

      "Often, the best way to use a niche is by turning it into an additional storage area, especially in small houses that don't have a lot of extra space. Though not always practical for small wall compartments, large niches provide ample room for a variety of objects. Try:  Attaching hooks to the wall, creating a spot for keys, coats, and other items. Installing shelves in your niche, turning it into a bookshelf or something similar. Placing lightweight drawers in the niche, converting it into a supply area. To some people, niches feel incredibly cramped and flat even when there's something inside. Thankfully, a simple mirror can usually fix the problem, creating the illusion of space and depth. Mirrors go particularly well with bathroom and bedroom niches, often serving as makeup or wardrobe aids. Bathroom niches, especially those placed inside a shower, are not well suited for displaying art. However, they often make for perfect supply stations. Because they're typically made with tile, these wall compartments work well with soap, hand sanitizer, lotion, and similar messy substances. Some other design ideas include:  Turning the niche into a towel holder. Using the wall compartment as a medicine container. Giving guests a spot to place their rings. In some houses, you may find a wall niche located next to the fireplace or in a nearby area. If you build fires often, the easiest way to decorate this wall compartment may be by simply filling it with lumber you intend to burn. Not only is this decor incredibly functional, but it will create a warm, natural aesthetic perfect for the winter. To avoid damaging the niche, place a sheet of cloth underneath the firewood.",
      "Depending on your niche's location, it may not have access to ample lighting, meaning the objects inside will be difficult to see. If this is the case, try adding accent lights to your wall compartment. Most people install small, low-watt spotlights inside their niche's ceiling, similar to a museum display. However, you can also install accent lights by:  Gluing a LED strip along the edges of the niche. Placing a tap light inside the niche. Pointing external spotlights at the niche. Unlike accent lights, which just add luminance, pendant lamps serve as both a lighting fixture and an artistic statement. Wired via a hole in the niche's ceiling, these lamps hang down and take up a large amount of space, pulling people's eyes to the area. Depending on your desired aesthetic, try going with a sleek, modern lamp or a more elegant fixture reminiscent of a chandelier. If your wall compartment has enough light already, try adding candles for purely aesthetic reasons. Large, tall candles will create an elegant look reminiscent of religious services and holidays. Small tea lights will create a more romantic display, bathing the area in warm light.",
      "Your niche can serve as a second frame for memorable or important pictures. Depending on the size of the photos, try hanging 1 large picture on the wall or multiple small pictures arranged in a column or similar pattern. If you can't alter the wall, place framed photos on the base of the niche instead. Niches are a great way to memorialize a beloved friend or family member. Plants, flowers, and other forms of foliage can add life to your niche, making it feel less like an artificial compartment and more like a piece of nature. Generic potted plants and flowers with muted colors, like lily whites and carnations, go well with most walls. For a more striking niche display, try flowers like roses, camellias, and dahlias. Often, the easiest way to decorate a wall compartment is with works of art. For small niches, try showing off busts, action figures, collectibles, signed objects, and other items that are either visually striking or personally meaningful. For large niches, go with paintings, posters, statues, 3D art, and similarly stunning, grandiose objects. Wall letters are a perfect solution for those who don't want to use generic objects or who have an oddly-shaped niche. Since wall letters are customizable, you can decorate them however you wish and arrange them in any order. Some simple design ideas include:  The names of your friends and family members. Your family motto. An inspirational quote."

      "If you're your own worst enemy, it's time to start getting real. How do you manage to keep getting in your own way? Before you start coming up with a plan to save yourself, it's important to get a real sense of what it is that needs to change.  Do you struggle with apathy? Does a Saturday afternoon full of promise turn into a YouTube spiral, an Xbox session, and a nap? Maybe you need to get motivated. Do you struggle with addiction? If a substance or activity has a grip on your life, you don't have to live with it or face it alone. Start dealing with your addiction and take control of your own life. Do you struggle with low self-esteem? You should be able to rely on yourself, not have to fear your self, critique yourself, and drag yourself down. If you have trouble being positive, your self-esteem might need to be addressed. Do you take too many risks that don't pan out? If you're a gambler, someone who gets a thrill from the possibility of danger, of consequence, or of failure, it's likely you'll come up short more often than not. While there's nothing wrong with a little thrill in your life, if you're taking dangerous risks that are affecting your safety, you might need to take steps to save yourself from it. What sets you off down a self-destructive path? Whether it be a person, a circumstance, or an idea, it's important to learn to recognize the things that trigger your self-destructive or spiraling behavior so you can start to cut it off before it takes hold. Pay attention to when you feel sudden urges and interrogate yourself at those moments. Write it down if necessary. When you've identified the things in your life that trigger negative emotional responses, replace them with positive behaviors. try to reprogram your mental pathways toward positivity and grace, as opposed to self-destruction and depression. It's easier than you think.  If dwelling on your relationship with your emotionally-abusive father makes you want to take a drink, learn to beat yourself to the punch. When you start focusing on thoughts of your father, head the gym. Hit the heavy bag for a couple hours. Blow off some steam. If you struggle with apathy and self-esteem issues, start celebrating each little achievement and taking steps to develop your self-respect. Start exercising and taking more risks. Treat yourself as you want to be treated. Take responsibility for yourself and start taking care of yourself. It's ok to rely on others for help every now and then, but there's also a time for pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. Start helping yourself.  If you're living at home above the age that it's appropriate to live at home, it might be time to move out. While that can be a great way of saving money after college, it can't be an excuse for not working. Take a step and grow up. Don't ask for help with things that you can do yourself. If your computer is acting up, you could call your friend in tears and fall apart, or you could try to figure it out on your own. Respect yourself enough to figure it out. The cool police, the criticism cops, the guilty conscience. Whatever you want to call it, you've got to learn to control the little voice inside you that needles you with negativity. A conscience is an essential part of being a moral person, but it can also drive you into the ground with feelings of guilt, of remorse, and of self-loathing. It might be unwise to ignore your conscience altogether, but learn to control it. Learn to use it when it's necessary and when to let it fade into the background. Start anticipating what will make you feel guilty later. You won't need to worry about a guilty conscience after the fact if you listen to it before the fact. If it will make you feel guilty later to send that text, or to take that drug, don't do it. You can't and shouldn't have to do everything alone. Learn to surround yourself with people who'll hold you up, who'll support you, who'll reinforce the good parts of you and make the bad parts seem distant. Avoid toxic relationships and enablers. People who reinforce the parts of you that need worked on might need to be cut from your life. While it might be difficult, cultivating healthier relationships can help to keep you safe from temptation.",
      "A bad situation can be hard to stomach, even if you're not quite sure what's wrong. If something just doesn't feel right, start interrogating yourself and getting specific about your condition and your circumstances. What's \"off\" about your life? What needs to be changed? Ask yourself the following questions to try to start narrowing down signs that you might be in a bad situation you need to be saved from.  Are you worried about your safety? Are you consistently stressed out about basic concerns, like where your next meal will be coming from, whether or not you'll make it through the day? If you're in a violent or dangerous situation, you might need to take drastic steps to change your life. Are you in a fulfilling relationship? Are you with someone that supports you and makes you feel good about yourself? try to figure out if your romantic life might be the cause of your problems. There's better out there. Are you happy at your job? Do you like your boss and coworkers? Do you spend more time having fun, or stressing about work? try to figure out if your job might be the problem in your life. Surrounding yourself with negative, violent, or self-destructive people is a fast-track to a difficult situation. While it can be hard to make a break from friends and loved ones who can't take care of themselves, if it's affecting you to the point of crisis, you've got to learn when it's time to cut your losses. Identify toxic or enabling relationships and end them. Save yourself from bad influences.  try to focus not on ending bad relationships but on starting new ones. Spend time with people you enjoy, people who will support your and lift you up. People who spend their time doing constructive and positive things. If you've taken big steps to cut addictive behaviors or substances from your life, but have lots of friends who haven't, it can be hard to maintain those relationships. Focus on finding new friends who do more uplifting and positive things with their time. In some cases, it might not be possible to save yourself from where you're living. Whether it be a town that doesn't offer the career options you want, a violent neighborhood that keeps you in fear, or a bad domestic life that you need to escape from, make a leap of faith and move. Move out.  Go somewhere you know people who'll be able to help you make the transition. Look up distant relatives or old friends from school who might be able to put you up for a couple days while you look for new work and find a place of your own. Start saving now to start putting your plan into effect. If you can't afford to move right now, you can still start helping yourself. Even just the act of saving up and doing the research of finding that next step can help to alleviate the negativity of being stuck where you are. Every teenager who ever lived, Paris and Pittsburgh, has wanted nothing more than to escape to the glitter and the glamour that exists somewhere else. Everyone who works a job, great or dead-end, has an afternoon that never ends, a week from hell, an epic chewing-out from the boss. Learning to differentiate between a circumstance that needs to change and a need for a change in attitude is a big step in growing as a person, becoming more mature, and learning to save yourself. Imagine the source of your problems is gone from your life forever. How would your life be different? Would it? If so, make the change. If not, fix yourself. If you've got the moving itch, make sure place is really the source of your problems. Is your town really as bad as you make it out? Would everything really be fixed if you moved to wherever? Or is the problem actually elsewhere? Don't outrun your problems, lest they pack their own bags to meet you there. No one should have to pull themselves out of a tough situation alone. Whether something as dire as getting out of a toxic relationship or as complicated as applying to graduate schools, learning to transcend your current condition and move to a better place requires the aid of others. Surround yourself with positive people and ask for their assistance when you need it.  If you're living in a violent situation, get help immediately. Visit a domestic violence center in your area or call 1-800-799-SAFE to get help. You don't deserve to live in fear.  Talk to family, friends, teachers, and people you respect and tell them you need help in changing your condition. Get advice. Sometimes it can be hard to identify the sources of your problems when you're so close to them. Listen, without being defensive, and trust in the wisdom of others.",
      "If you suspect you might have a desire for knowledge and for satisfaction that can't be easily answered, you might need to turn to deeper questions to find solace. Whether you consider yourself a spiritual person or not, considering the big questions can lead many people to a new sense of purpose and fulfillment, helping to realign priorities and perspectives. Why are we here? What does it mean to lead a good life? Embrace the difficulty and the mystery of these questions. Whether you want to call it \"god\" or not, learning to give up some of your ego and embrace the idea of a higher power can be a powerful experience for a lot of people. It can be enough to save yourself. If you're not interested in religion, that doesn't mean you can't find a way to live faithfully and with a deep sense of purpose. Physicists, artists, and people in lots of different fields are serious to the point of deep spirituality regarding knowledge. Throw yourself into something entirely and find redemption in work. An essential part of any religious practice is worshipping with like-minded believers. To learn more about whatever purpose, practice, or religion you're thinking of adopting, the best way to learn isn't from a book or from a video, but from real interactions with other believers. try to practice as they practice and bring your questions and concerns to the table. Deepen your questions into beliefs and a daily practice that you can comfort yourself with. Spiritual practice should be a daily activity. Even if you only go to church once a week, or if you choose not to go to church at all, try to build some kind of daily devotion into your life. Meditating for a few minutes every day can help you keep you tied back into those deep questions you're interested in. If you want to grow in your renewed sense of purpose and your interest in the divine, it may be appropriate to devote yourself to an organized religion. Start by learning as much as you can about different modes of worship and experimenting with different theologies and schools of thought to find one that fits you and your beliefs.

      "The main cause of cirrhosis is long-term alcoholism. Men and women react differently to alcohol as tolerance varies from one person to another. Most men can take two to five bottles of beer a day while one or two bottles can damage a woman’s liver. People who consume a lot of alcohol and drink often have a higher possibility of developing cirrhosis, however, it really comes down to the individual. In some cases, one drink can damage a person’s liver. These infections include Hepatitis B and C, both of which can damage the liver. These conditions are caused by viruses, though they can also be transmitted via bodily fluids. The people who are at a greater risk of contracting the disease are health care workers. This is a condition caused by accumulation of fat in the liver. This condition usually occurs in people who are diabetic, obese and have high blood pressure. The fat causes tenderness and scarring to the liver and over a period, this leads to cirrhosis. Therefore, the people who suffer from these conditions are at a higher risk of getting cirrhosis. The bile ducts help to transport the bile formed by the liver to the intestines. The bile is used in the digestion of fats and can accumulate, thus scarring the liver. In adults, the bile ducts can become blocked or scarred if the person experiences a serious infection somewhere in the body. In children, blockage of the bile duct can be caused by biliary atresia, which is when the bile ducts are damaged or they are absent. This causes the bile to accumulate in the liver, causing the liver to stop functioning properly.",
      "Feeling tired can be caused by increased fluid volume in the body. This causes the different body systems to be overworked. You may also start feeling very weak, which can be perceived as being fatigued. The feeling of being excessively itchy is caused by the accumulation of the waste products in the blood stream, as the diseased liver is not able to perform its function of removing waste products. When the liver becomes damaged, it has a harder time producing blood clotting factors. This problem can lead to red palms, as well as nose bleeds. You may also notice that you begin to pass black tarry stools. Damage to the liver means that it is unable to accumulate glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides the body with temporary energy. When the liver is damaged, it forces the body to use its muscle tissue to supply energy in between meals and this causes weakness and muscle wasting, which in turn causes weight loss. When the liver stops functioning properly, it is unable to perform its tasks that it normally does effortlessly. Toxins will begin to accumulate in your blood which can cause a loss of appetite or a feeling of nausea.",
      "In the advanced phase of the disease, the liver is unable to filter the harmful substances from the blood. This will cause an accumulation of poisonous substances in the brain therefore altering the brain function. You may begin to suffer from fainting episodes, sleepiness, and confusion. In turn, these symptoms can lead to a coma in severe cases. See a doctor right away if you suddenly feel very confused or begin to have fainting spells. This same issue can also cause personality changes that include behavioral change and memory problems. In particular, examine your eyes, skin and tongue. When these parts of your body turn yellow, it is a sign that you have jaundice. Jaundice is caused by cirrhosis; your liver is not functioning properly, thus there an increased amount of bilirubin in your blood. Swelling of the feet, legs and ankles occurs because the liver is not able to remove waste products to include the excess water from the body. This causes water and salt to accumulate in the body. This will also cause the abdomen to become distended as water accumulates. Men will often experience the swelling of their breast, shrinking of testicles and, in worst cases, impotence. Increased heartbeat occurs because of the increased volume of fluids in the bloodstream. This happens because the diseased liver is not able to remove excess water from the body. This overworks the heart because it is already pumping all of your blood throughout your body. In turn, your heart rate will increase. Damage to the liver means that it is unable to accumulate glycogen, a carbohydrate that provides the body with temporary energy. When the liver is damaged, it forces the body to use its muscle tissue to supply energy in between meals and this causes weakness and muscle wasting. One of the side effects of late stage cirrhosis is the inability to stop a cut from bleeding. When the liver becomes damaged, it has a difficult time creating the blood clotting factors needed to stop blood from leaking out of a cut. You should also take note if your gums seem to bleed more often than normal, even if you brush them very gently."

    "document": [
      "The large national outlets like Nordstroms, Zales, Jared’s, and Sarraf are the most trustworthy in terms of quality but often include significant markups and similar pieces can be found for less at independent dealers. If you do look for an independent dealer, make sure to do your research and make sure they are reputable.  Don’t be afraid to ask a potential jeweler for their credentials and proof of certification. Pick a jeweler that offers a variety of services such as resizing and custom design. If it’s a significant purchase, don’t buy at the first store you visit. Look for similar pieces at other stores so you have a price comparison. Reputable jewelers typically offer warranties and some kind of return policy. Warranties will add to the cost but may be a good idea for an expensive piece or one that is made of highly pure gold, because of the risk of damage. Make sure to ask about this before your purchase. Gold jewelry will have a hallmark signifying that it is real gold and other aspects of the quality. The marking is usually in an inconspicuous place like the inside of a ring or on the ear-facing side of an earring. Ask your jeweler where the hallmarks are if you’re having trouble finding them.  The markings will demonstrate purity in one of two ways. Some will show the number of karats with the letter ‘K’ after it. For example, ‘24K’ means 24 karat pure gold. Some gold pieces will instead have a three digit number that expresses the percentage of purity to the tenth decimal point. For example, 14 karat gold might say ‘585,’ which means that it’s 58.5 percent pure and 8 karat gold might say ‘333,’ which means it’s one-third pure.  Beyond the purity, there should also be a marking to indicate the additive metal for impure alloyed gold. ‘GF’ means gold filled, ‘GP’ means gold plated. To express the base metal, ‘Pd’ means Palladium, ‘PT’ or ‘PLAT’ means platinum and ‘SS’ or ‘STEEL’ means stainless steel.  There may also be a single or double-digit marking for the ring size if it’s a ring. If it’s an exceptionally expensive purchase or if you have any doubts about the quality, you may want to have the jewelry independently verified. Take the jewelry to a different store and pay a certified jeweler to examine and appraise the piece. US laws requires the karat value trademarks which should help you avoid scams. If you are purchasing gold jewelry online, make sure that at least one of the pictures displays the trademarks and ask for one from the seller if they do not. Research the typical price of your gold piece accounting for the purity. Watch out for gold that is extremely cheap as it may be counterfeit or have false markings.",
      "Gold jewelry wears and collect dirt easily so it should be cleaned regularly. If you wear the jewelry every day, clean it at least once every other month. You’ll need two bowls of warm water, dishwashing soap, a lint-free cloth, and a toothbrush.  Add a few drops of dishwashing soap to a large bowl filled with warm water. Gently place the jewelry in the water and let it soak for about 15 minutes. Pick up the jewelry and scrub it with the toothbrush. Pay special attention to the crevices where dirt can collect. Rinse the jewelry in the water bowl without the soap. Make sure you remove all soap residue. Gently blot the jewelry dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. Place the jewelry on the cloth and let it air dry for about 20 minutes. Gold jewelry easily collects dust, especially pieces with a lot of crevices. If you aren’t wearing the jewelry on a daily basis, keep it in a small jewelry box. Try to keep it separate from other jewelry pieces that might cause scratching on contact. Gold jewelry will collect soap residue and potentially wear from hot water in a shower so make sure to take it off before bathing. Place is in a soft cloth where it won’t be damaged.",
      "The value of gold is determined by its purity, also known as ‘fineness.' This is measured in karats. The karat measurement divides purity into 24ths. For example, 24 karat gold is 100 percent pure and 12 karat gold is 50 percent pure. While gold is generally more valuable at higher levels of purity, you or the person you are purchasing the jewelry for may prefer less pure gold for practical reasons. 24 karat gold is very soft and highly prone to scratching and damage.  Of course, pure gold is also vastly more expensive than alloyed gold.  If you plan on wearing the jewelry on a daily basis, you will probably want it to be no more than 18 karats, i.e. 75 percent pure, to avoid damage.  You should also consider how often your jewelry will come into contact with hard surfaces on a regular basis. For example, highly pure gold rings and bracelets are likely to experience damage if worn daily. Plated and vermeil describe methods of dipping other metals into molten gold to create a coating. This jewelry will be cheaper than the purer varieties but also more prone to cracking and wear.  Plating involves dipping a base metal like steel or brass into an electroplating solution with a lump of pure gold. An electric current is applied and the gold will attach itself in a thin layer around the metal. The plating is usually very thin and prone to wear.  Vermeil involves the same plating process but specifically refers to jewelry that has a base material of sterling silver. Sterling silvery is often preferred by people that have allergies to precious medals. The plating is usually very thin and prone to wear. Gold typically comes in yellow, pink, and white. There is also a rarer green variety. The pink, white, and green varieties are created by mixing gold with other metals. The non-yellow varieties are usually no more than 18 karats.  Yellow gold represents the color of the natural color of the mineral but that doesn’t mean that all yellow gold jewelry is pure. Don’t assume that yellow gold is pure and always check the markings.  White gold is created by mixing in palladium or nickel. It resembles silver but has a slightly brighter hue. Pink or rose gold is created by mixing in copper. Green gold is created by mixing in silver. Because of the value of both silver and gold, green gold is usually more expensive than other varieties."

      "Push mowers are safe for 12 year olds whereas riding mowers should only be used by teens who are at least 16 years old. Before you start mowing, ask your neighbor what height they’d like the grass, what parts of the yard you should cut, and if they have any special instructions (like not to mow too close to the flowerbed).  Charge anywhere from $30 to $50 based on the size of the yard. Find out what others are charging in your area. Only mow during sunlight hours and good weather when the conditions are safest. Always wear closed-toe shoes and safety glasses to protect your eyes from flying bits of grass or debris. If your neighbor has pets or small children, ask that they be kept inside while you mow for safety reasons. Grab a rake and a few large trash bags and go from house to house offering your services. Ask your neighbors what areas of their lawn they want raked and where you should put the leaves, like on the curb for collection or dumped in a wooded area behind their house. Rake leaves into a large pile, then stuff them into a trash bag and tie it closed.  Avoid raking leaves immediately after it rains. Wet leaves are much heavier and difficult to rake up. Wait for the yard to dry out before raking it. If you’re dumping the leaves instead of bagging them, use a large rubber trash can with wheels instead of a trash bag. It’s easy to fill and roll to wherever you’re putting the leaves. Pick a shovel that’s lightweight yet sturdy and has a non-stick blade. Come up with a shoveling strategy, whether it’s working from the top of the driveway to the bottom or going in diagonal lines across the driveway. Push the snow from side to side and only pick it up when you need to avoid wearing yourself out fast.  Charge a flat rate of $10 to $20 depending on the size of the driveway and whether your neighbors want you to shovel their sidewalks or front porch. When you’re shoveling snow, always bend at your knees, not at your waist, to protect your back. Dress appropriately for the cold weather since you’ll be outside for hours. Wear a heavy coat, waterproof gloves, a hat or earmuffs, and snow boots with a good tread so you don’t slip on ice. Volunteer to weed the garden, plant flowers, water the plants, or mulch the garden. People begin tending to their gardens as early as March so start advertising your services at the end of February or the beginning of March. It’s a great way to get outside and learn how to garden.   For weeding, planting, or mulching, charge by the hour. For example, if your rate is $5 an hour and you spend 3 hours on Sunday morning mulching the garden, you’ll get $15. Since watering plants isn’t an hourly job, charge a flat rate based on how many plants there are and how often you’ll be required to water them. Gather some sponges or old rags, towels, car washing liquid, a big bucket, and a hose and set up a washing station in your driveway for a few hours on the weekend. Scrub each vehicle, focusing on any dirty spots, rinse it thoroughly, and buff it dry with a microfiber towel. Charge $10 to $20 per vehicle.  Advertise your services the week before so your neighbors know you’re open for business. Make a little extra money by offering to clean the inside of the car, too, which is known as detailing. Vacuum the floor mats, wipe down the dashboard, and clean out the cupholders. If you get really busy, “hire” some friends to help out. Just remember that means you’ll have to split the money, too.",
      "If your parents already pay you an allowance, find out if you can make a little extra money by going above and beyond. Offer to do the laundry, clean the bathrooms, or vacuum all the rugs in the house. Let your neighbors know that you’re available for hire, too.  Elderly neighbors in particular who have difficulty doing things around the house will appreciate your services. Don’t expect to get paid for doing the tasks you’re already expected to do like keeping your own room tidy or cleaning up after yourself in the kitchen. Water their plants, take out the trash, check the mail, and keep an eye on things. They may ask you to visit 1 to 2 times a day or even spend the night at their house so it doesn’t look empty and prevents burglary. Follow all of your neighbor’s rules and instructions and always lock up the house when you leave to keep it safe.  If you have to stay the night, ask an older sibling or parent to stay with you. Ask your neighbor to write down all of the important instructions in case you forget, along with their contact information so you can reach them if there’s an emergency or if you have a question. Be respectful of your neighbor’s home. They’re trusting you with a huge responsibility so don’t break that trust by inviting friends over, eating their food, or using their things, unless they tell you it’s okay to do so. Ask your neighbors with dogs if they need a walker. Show up on time each day and bring an extra leash, water bottle, dog bowl, and poop bags just in case. Walk the dog for the amount of time your neighbor specifies and charge a rate based on the length of the walk and how much experience you have.  Write down your schedule on your phone or in a planner to keep track of which dogs you’re walking on which days. Spending time with the dog before your first walk will help both you and the dog get to know each other. Ask your neighbor if you can play with them in the backyard for an hour or so before your first day. Know your limits. You might not be comfortable with dogs who are overly aggressive. Say no to opportunities if you feel unsure of yourself, even if it’s good pay. Pet sitting is just like babysitting but for animals. If you’re comfortable with animals, let your neighbors know that you’re available to watch their pets when they go away. Always respect their rules and ask ahead of time if you have any questions about the care instructions.  Meet with your neighbor before they leave to go over exactly what you need to do as well as determine how much they’re going to pay you. How much you charge will depend on the length of your pet sitting, how many animals you’re watching, and how much responsibility you have. For example, if you’re just feeding their fish once a day, you’ll charge less than if you’re walking their dog 2 times a day and giving him insulin shots. Write down all of the necessary contact information in case of an emergency, like your neighbors' cell phone numbers, the vet’s name and phone number, etc. Think about the classes you do best in at school or the topics you know a lot about. Help out your peers or teach younger kids who want to get a head start before the next school year. Put up fliers around your neighborhood or school with the topics you’re tutoring, the cost, and what services you offer.   Charge either an hourly rate or a flat rate per session. Make sure your price is fair for how much help you’re offering. For example, if you’re just helping someone study their algebra flashcards, you’d charge less than if you’re coaching someone through an English paper. Prepare for a tutoring session by reviewing the material, purchasing textbooks or practice books, and asking your student what sorts of things they’re learning in class or what they’re having trouble with. All you need are a few pretty polishes and a little creativity to start your own pop-up nail studio. Charge extra for fancy designs, glitter, or stick-on jewels. Offer a discount if they get a manicure and a pedicure. For example, if a manicure is $5 and a pedicure is $6, make a mani-pedi $10 for a $1 savings to encourage people to spend more.  Watch video tutorials online to learn how to draw designs like flowers, swirls, or stars. Trim nails, give hand massages with cuticle cream, or remove old polish for an additional cost. Find out if there are routes available in your area by contacting your local newspaper. Collect your bag of papers each morning and ride your bike from house to house to hand them out or have your parents drive you around. Most newspapers have to be delivered very early around 5 a.m. so be prepared to wake up at the crack of dawn.  The average wage for delivering newspapers is $11.48, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  If you don’t want to work every single day, share your route with 2 to 3 friends or family members and switch off days. Some of the world’s most successful men, like Walt Disney, Warren Buffett, and Tom Cruise, started out delivering newspapers. Many recycling sites will pay a small fee per pound of recyclable items. Go around your neighborhood collecting things like glass bottles, soda cans, newspapers, cereal boxes, and milk jugs. Have your parents drive you to the nearest recycling center and turn in your haul in exchange for money.  Some recycling centers require you to prepare items before you recycle them like rinsing cans or taking caps off bottles. Call your collection site to find out what their regulations are.  To know if a piece of plastic can be recycled, look for the recycling symbol (a triangle made of 3 arrows) on the bottom or back of the container. If the number inside the triangle is 1 or 2, it can be recycled. If the number is 3, 6, or 7, it cannot be recycled. And if the number is 4 or 5, check with your recycling center.",
      "Clean out your room and gather up all of the toys, decor, and clothes that you no longer use or want. Display your items on a folding table in your yard or driveway with your parents' permission. Put prices on each piece with a sticker label based on what you think it’s worth and the original price of the item.  The best time to throw a yard sale is on the weekends in the morning. That’s when most people who shop yard sales are out and about. Ask your parents and siblings if they have anything they want to get rid of, too. If you have more variety of items at your sale, you’ll attract people of all ages. Be willing to negotiate prices. Know ahead of time what the lowest price you’ll accept for different items is and stick to it when bargaining with customers. Who doesn’t love an afternoon pick-me-up in the form of a chocolate bar? Buy candy in bulk at a warehouse store like Sam’s Club or Costco where it’s much cheaper. Then, resell the individual candy bars or packs for a profit by doubling the price.  For example, if you bought 12 candy bars for $12, you paid $1 per bar. Sell them at a price of $2 and you’ll pocket $12 after deducting the original cost. If you’re planning to sell the candy at school or on the bus, check your school rules to make sure that’s allowed. Bring a parent with you if you decide to go door-to-door to stay safe. You’ll need a folding table, a sign that says “Lemonade For Sale!”, plastic cups, straws, a large pitcher, ice, and, of course, lemonade. If you’re setting up your stand in the front yard, make your lemonade in the kitchen and keep it refrigerated so it stays cool. Sell the lemonade per cup.  If your stand is farther from your house, make the lemonade ahead of time and store it in a cooler underneath your table. Charge extra for ice and a straw (using more materials means a higher cost!). While you can use bottled lemonade, you won’t be able to charge as much as if you make your own. People will pay more for hand-squeezed lemonade that they can’t buy themselves at the store. Selling snacks like pretzels or cookies along with the lemonade is a good way to make some extra money. Choose classic recipes that are easy to make in big batches like chewy chocolate chip cookies, fudgy brownies, or vanilla cupcakes. Once you bake everything, separate your goodies into individual servings and place them in pretty packages like treat bags tied with ribbons. Set up a stand in your front yard or out on the street corner to get more traffic.  Food safety and cleanliness is very important when you’re selling homemade food. Always wash your hands with soap and water before you bake or handle food and make sure you’re using the freshest ingredients. Contact your public health department or local government to find out if you need any special permits to sell your baked goods. Use boxed mixes or make your recipes from scratch. Another option is to specialize in a certain type of food, like gluten-free or vegan baked goods, to make your bake sale unique. If your parents let you plant your own garden in the backyard, opt for easy-to-grow vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, or cucumbers. If you will be growing your plants inside in pots, choose ones that don’t require a lot of sunlight or space. Pick your vegetables when they’re ripe and sell them in bags or plastic containers.  If you’re growing flowers or herbs, consider selling the entire potted plant so the buyer can continue to enjoy it for years to come. Herbs like basil, oregano, and chives grow well indoors. Other good houseplants include succulents, ferns, and spider plants.  Most vegetables should be planted in March or April to be ready to harvest in the summer. Google your specific plant or ask the local nursery if you aren’t sure. Turn your hobby into a side business. Whether it’s homemade candles, friendship bracelets, or pretty cards, sell your crafts at a local craft fair, farmer’s market, or online on Etsy. Price your goods by considering how much you spent on materials and how long it took you to make each product.  The more hours you spend on a piece and the more expensive the materials, the higher the price should be. You have to be at least 13 years old to start an Etsy shop and if you’re under 18, you need a parent’s permission. If you’re under 13, ask your parents to set up the shop in their name. Some boutiques and mom-and-pop stores sell local crafts. Find out if there are any in your area that will take your amazing creations.",
      "Fill it with everything you might need, like a first-aid kit, snacks, and a back-up phone charger. Include things for the kids, too, like coloring books, glitter glue, toys, and puzzles.  Choose items based on the ages of the kids. For example, if you're watching an infant, you'll want stuffed animals instead of toys with tiny parts that they could choke on. A basic first-aid kit should include adhesive bandages, hand sanitizer, medical tape, wet wipes, and gloves. The average rate for babysitting is $14 an hour. Base your own rate on your experience and the number of kids you’ll be watching. Make sure you and the parents decide on a rate before they leave you with the kids.  There are babysitting apps that let parents pay you via their phone so you don't have to carry a wad of cash home. Talking about money can be awkward but don't be nervous to ask for a reasonable amount. You deserve it! 15 minutes is enough time to review all of the house rules, expectations, and contact information before the parents leave. Ask about bedtimes, allergies, and how they discipline their kids, too. Write it down in a notebook so you don't forget.  This is a good time to discuss your payment if you haven't already. Let them know your rate now even though they'll likely pay you when they get home. Don't be late! Showing up even 1 minute late makes you look irresponsible and untrustworthy. Be firm with the kids. If they try to tell you that their parents let them do something that the parents specifically said not to do (like stay up past their bedtime), err on the side of caution and obey the parents’ rules. The parents will be impressed by your maturity and responsibility and hopefully invite you back!  When in doubt, ask. Never hesitate to call the parents if you aren’t sure of something or if the kids are acting up. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Never hit or yell harshly at a child. Use an authoritative voice to remind them of the rules and the consequences if they continue to misbehave. Find one at your local community center or online on the American Red Cross’ website. Get certified in first aid and CPR, too. Not only will you learn a lot of helpful information, being certified will help you book babysitting jobs because parents will trust you more.  Online courses cost $35 whereas in-person classes cost up to $89. If you’re younger than 11 or not comfortable being on your own with other kids yet, start out by being a mother’s helper. You’ll take care of the children or play with them while their mom or dad are still home."

      "Stock Dividends",
      "Cash Dividends"
    ],
    "document": [
      "A stock dividend is another type of dividend that doesn't involve the distribution of any cash to shareholders. Rather, a stock dividend distributes additional shares of the company to shareholders, perhaps at a percentage rate to shares that they already hold. Though this will increase the total number of shares outstanding, it does not transfer more money to shareholders or away from the company. Instead, it simply dilutes the value of shares and transfers money between retained earnings and shareholder equity. Just like a cash dividend, a stock dividend will be declared on a specific date and will offer a specific number of shares to be distributed. Generally, a stock dividend will be made for an increase of no more than 20-25% of current total shares outstanding. This is because anything more would be categorized differently, as a a stock split (a dilution of shares to manipulate market price). For example, your company may declare on February 1 to issue a 20% stock dividend on your 10,000 outstanding shares on March 1, the date of payment. February 1 would mark the first recording of this transaction. Multiply the number of shares to be distributed by the market value of each share. This amount is one of the values that you will record in the following steps and represents the total book value of the stock dividend distribution.  The number of shares distributed will simply be the chosen percentage stock dividend (20% in our example) multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. In the example, this would be 10,000 x 20%, or 2,000 shares. The market value of each share used should be the value that a share of the company trades for on the declaration date. The retained earnings account should be debited (decreased) by the amount found in the last step (the market value of shares x the number of new shares). This entry should be posted on the declaration day. To continue our example, imagine that the market value of a share of your company is trading for $50 on the declaration date. Then, the amount debited from retained earnings would be $50 x 2,000, or $100,000. This account will be credited by an amount defined by the number of shares distributed times the par value of the stock. The par value here is the book value of the stock and should already be recorded in any company's books. This entry should be posted on the declaration day. Imagine that for our example the par value is $1 per share. Thus, the amount credit to the common stock dividend distributable account would be $1 x 2,000 shares, or $2,000. This account will be credited by an amount defined by the difference between the amount debited from retained earnings and the amount credited to common stock dividends distributable. This account represent the amount of money distributed above and beyond the par value of the stock. This entry should be posted on the declaration day. In our example, this amount would be $100,000 (the amount debited to retained earnings) minus $2,000 (the amount credited to common stock dividends distributable), or $98,000. On the date of payment (when the shares are distributed to shareholders), another accounting entry must be made. This is done by debiting the common stock dividends distributable account and crediting the common stock account by the same amount. This amount will be the amount previously credited to the common stock dividends distributable account. In the example, your debit and the credit amounts for this entry would be $2,000.",
      "This occurs on the \"date of declaration,\" when the board of directors formally authorizes payment of dividends. Under standard accounting procedures, expenses are recorded when they are incurred. In this case, dividend expenses are recorded because by declaring them the company is held liable to make good on the declaration and deliver the dividend.  A declaration specifies when the declaration is made, when the date of record is, and when the dividend will be paid. The date of record specifies the date by which a shareholder must own stock in order to qualify for the dividend. For example, imagine your company declares a cash dividend on February 1 that will be paid to shareholders on March 1 and that the date of record is set at February 15. The liability would be recorded on February 1. Debit the retained earnings account for the total amount of the dividends that will be paid out. This will function as a decrease in this account because money that could have been retained is being paid out instead. This entry is made on the date of declaration. Continuing the previous example, imagine you company has 10,000 shares outstanding (total shares) and decides to issue a dividend of $0.50 per share. Your total debit from retained earning would be the same as the total value of the dividend payout, or $5,000 ($0.50 x $10,000). The dividends payable account recorded how much the company owes to shareholders between declaring a dividend and actually paying it. This account will be credited (increased) on the date of declaration. Like the debit to retained earnings, the amount credited will be the total value of the dividends declared. In our example, your company would credit dividends payable for $5,000 (the same amount as was debited from retained earnings). The only other entry needed when issuing a cash dividend is the entry on the date on which the company actually pays the cash dividend. Because this is a cash payment, you would credit the cash account (decreasing it) and debit the dividends payable account (decreasing it). This is because both transactions represent money leaving the company. Again, the value recorded will be the total value of the dividends paid. So, in our example, you would credit cash for $5,000 and also debit dividends payable for $5,000 on the date of payment, March 1. When you declare and pay a dividend, the transaction will affect your company's balance sheet. At the end of the account period, you'll be left with a cash account and retained earnings account that are lowered by the amount of the dividend that you paid out."

      "Stretchy bracelets are the easiest to make, and require the fewest tools. You can make a simple, child-friendly one using elastic cord and plastic pony beads. You can also make a dainty one using clear elastic and glass beads. Here is a list of what you will need:  Beading elastic or cord. Beads Scissors Tape or binder clip Super glue Take the beading elastic and wrap it one and a half times around your wrist. Cut it with a pair of sharp scissors. You are making it slightly larger so that you can knot it later. Hold the elastic between your fingers and stretch it gently. This will prevent the elastic from stretching out later on and creating gaps. This will prevent the beads from sliding off while you work. If you do not have any tape, or if the tape won't stick, use a binder clip instead. You do not need a needle for this; most elastic is stiff enough that you can put the bead directly onto the string. Hold the elastic close to the end, and slip the beads on. Try to put the bead with the largest hole on first. Once you finish the bracelet, you can hide the knot by sliding it under that bead. Be sure to wrap the bracelet round your wrist from time to time. The first and last bead should be touching, and the bracelet should be somewhat loose. You do not want it to stretch around your wrist. If you see any gaps or cord, you will need more beads. Start by folding the two ends of the elastic over and under each other, like tying a pair of shoes. Tie another knot like it but don't tighten it yet; you will have something that looks like a ring. Wrap one of the tail ends around one side of the circle. Do the same thing for the other side. Now you can tighten the knot. This will determine how you finish off the bracelet. Be sure to have a bottle of super glue ready.  If you can slide the knot under one of the beads, trim off the extra string and put a drop of glue over the knot. Slide the knot under the bead. If you can't fit the knot under one of the beads, tuck the tail ends inside the beads instead. Put a drop of glue on top of the knot to seal it. If you try to put the bracelet on too soon, the knot may loosen and the glue may crack. Most glues will dry in about 15 minutes, and cure after 24 hours; refer to the label for more exact drying times.",
      "These sorts of bracelets are fun, and easy to make. You simply put the beads onto the cord and knot it. You do not need a clasp. To learn how to make a stretchy beaded bracelet, click here. You can buy beading elastic in a bead shop, or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store.  Clear elastic thread comes in many different thicknesses. Thicker elastic is sturdy, which makes it suitable for large beads. Thinner elastic is more delicate, and looks best paired with smaller beads. Elastic cords have a thread or fabric covering. They are thick by beading standards, and usually come in black and white. Beading wire cannot be tied like elastic, and must be used with crimps and clasps. The crimps help hold the bracelet together. Be sure to use beading wire, which is flexible. Wire used for wire wrapping is too stiff and thick; it is not suitable for beading. To learn how to make a beaded bracelet with a clasp, click here. Consider using memory wire for a fun, spiral bracelet. Smaller beads will work well on thin, delicate elastic. Large beads, however, will need something heavier, such as a thicker elastic or wire. You will also need to add extra length to your bracelet if you are using bulky beads. These beads fill up the space between the bracelet and your wrist, making the bracelet fit tighter. There are many different types of beads. Each material has a specific look, and some types of beads are more suitable to certain projects than others. Here are the most common beads you will find in bead shop or an arts and crafts store:  Plastic beads are the least expensive and come in many different shapes and colors. They are ideal for kids' arts and crafts. For a fun, kid-friendly bracelet, try using elastic cord in a bright color, and using plastic pony beads. You can also use alphabet beads so the kids can spell their names on the bracelet. Glass beads are beautiful, and come in many different colors. They capture the light well and had a mid-price range. Most glass beads will be translucent, and some will have designs. Semi-precious stones tend to be more expensive than glass beads. They also tend to be heavier. Because they are made from natural materials, no two beads are alike. You can also find beads made from natural material, such as shell, wood, ivory, and coral. These tend to be expensive and unique; no two beads are the same. When buying beads, you may find that the beads are already strung for you. This is simply another way of packaging them, and is not suggestive of a final design. Simply snip the beads off their string and arrange them in a new pattern on your desk or bead tray. Here are some ideas for a design:  Put the largest beads towards the center, and the smallest beads towards the clasps. Alternate large beads with smaller/spacer beads. Use a warm (red, orange, yellow) or a cool (green, blue, and purple) color scheme. Choose a bunch of beads that are all the same color, but in different sizes and shades. For example, you could use light blue, medium blue, and dark blue beads. You can find them in bead shops or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. They usually come in gray, and have a velvety texture. They have necklace-shaped groves with measurements. This allows beaders to lay out their pattern and see what their necklace or bracelet may look like before they put the beads on the string.",
      "Multi-strand bracelets are fun to make. You make all strands using the same type of bead, but in different colors. You can also make each strand using a different type of bead. Seed beads are great for this type of bracelet. Here is a list of what you will need:  Beading thread Beading needle Beads Bead tips (also called bead clamps, clam shells, bead ends, or string tips) 2 jump rings Clasp and hook Needle nose pliers Scissors Super glue This will allow the bracelet to hang loosely around your wrist. This will give you the length of your finished bead strands. You will be folding them in half in a later step. This will make one beaded strand. You will want about two to four knots. Don't worry if they look messy; you will be hiding them. You should end up with a large knot and four strands of thread coming out of it. This will make the bracelet more durable. You can use your fingertips or a pair of needle nose pliers to close the bead tip. The loop on the bead tip should be on the same side as the short, extra ends of your thread. You will trim them off later. Keep stringing until the bracelet is a little bit shorter than you want it to be. Don't tie the knot too close, however, or you will put too much pressure on the thread. Try to leave a small gap between the knot and bead. You can use your fingertips or a pair of needle nose pliers to close the bead tip. The loop of the bead tip should be facing away from the beads. When you finish all of your strands, lay them out side by side in an order that you find visually pleasing. If you'd prefer a \"tangled\" look to your finished bracelet, interweave your strands rather than keeping them separate. Hold a jump ring with your fingers and a pair of needle nose pliers. The cut part of the jump ring should be between your fingers and the pliers. Hold the ring tightly with the pliers, then move your fingers away from you. The jump ring will twist open. Repeat this step for the other jump ring. Hold the jump ring with the needle nose pliers, and slip the clasp and beaded strands onto the ring. Only one end of the beaded strands should be on the jump ring. The other ends of the strands should be hanging freely. Still holding the jump ring with the pliers, take hold of the ring with your fingers. Move your hand towards you, twisting the ring close. Slip the clasp onto the other jump ring, along with the strands. Close the jump ring.",
      "Clasped bracelets are more advanced than stretchy bracelets. You will need additional tools and supplies in order to finish one. Here is a list of what you will need:  Beading wire Clasp and hook 2 crimp beads 2 seed beads Beads Wire cutters Needle nose pliers Tape or binder clip You are making the bracelet longer so that you can finish it. You also want the bracelet to be somewhat loose, or it won't be very comfortable. Lastly, you are adding extra length because some beads add more bulk than others. You want to use a soft, flexible wire. Do not the stiff kind meant for wire wrapping. You can find beading wire in a bead shop or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. It usually comes on a flat, disk-shaped spool. You are doing this so that you can string the beads on without losing any. If you don't have any tape, you can use a binder clip instead. If you do not have a beading tray, lay your pattern down on a table, right next to the measuring tape. This will allow you to determine how many beads you will need for your design. If you are doing a simple design (such as two altering colors) or a random design, you do not need to do this. Once you have decided on your pattern, start putting the beads onto the wire. You do not need a needle for this. Simply hold the wire close to the end, and start popping the beads on. Be sure to measure against your wrist from time to time; large beads will add bulk, so you may need to make the bracelet longer to make it fit. Once you have all of the beads on the wire, put on a crimp bead, then a seed bead, and finally a clasp. It does not matter which part of the clasp you put on first. You can use any type of clasp. A spring or lobster-claw clasp is the most traditional, but a magnetic one may make the bracelet easier to take on and off. The clasp should be hanging off of the top of the loop. You want them to be snug, but still loose enough so that the clasp can still wiggle. Leave about an inch (2.54 centimeters) long tail on the wire. Be sure to pinch the bead tightly. The crimp is your \"knot,\" so it needs to be secure. Gently tug on the wire. If it moves, pinch the crimp bead tighter. Do not trim the tail off. The beads will slide down towards the crimp and clasp. Tuck the tail into those first few beads, hiding it. Take off the tape or binder clip from before. Put on a crimp bead, a seed bead, and the other part of the clasp. Thread the wire back through the seed bead and crimp. Gently tug on the tail until the beads are flush with the clasp. If the bracelet is too big, you will need to take off a few beads. If the bracelet is too small, you will need to add some more beads. To do this, simply pull the clasp, seed bead, and crimp off, and then make the adjustments. Be sure to replace the crimp, seed bead, and clasp once everything fits. If you see things shifting a little, simply pinch the crimp harder. Press the flat side of the wire cutters against the bead and carefully snip off the read of the tail."

Repeating colors is the way to help prints complement each other instead of clashing. Colors can pull two completely different prints together and make them look like they were made for each other!  One way to repeat print colors is to choose two prints with the same dominant color. For example, you might have a lime green-striped skirt and a paisley with a lime-green background. For a slightly bolder look, choose a less dominant color from one print and match that color with your second print. For example, if you have an ikat print with a touch of rose, pair it with a rose-colored plaid. The colors don't have to match exactly, but they should be close enough that it's clear they are meant to go together. If you have too many prints in the same size, your outfit or home décor could end up looking busy. Think of prints in terms of their size, and choose a big size and a smaller size to go together. Having prints in a range of sizes creates visual harmony instead of headaches.  For example, if you have a skirt with a large floral pattern, try pairing it with a thin-striped top. If your couch has a big plaid pattern, use throw pillows with a smaller print. If you're mixing three different prints, aim to have the largest print take up 60 percent of the look, choose a medium print to comprise 30 percent of the look, and have the smallest print make up the last 10 percent as an accent. This balances the overall appearance of the prints and keeps them from being too overwhelming.  For example, you might wear a maxi skirt with a large floral pattern, a mid-top with a medium stripe print, and statement necklace with a small colorful print. In your home, try pairing wallpaper with a big, bold print with a chair or sofa with medium print and accent pillows or lamp shades with the smallest print. Sometimes two prints that would otherwise clash need something solid to break them up. Choose a solid color that matches both prints and feature it prominently in between the prints, rather than having the prints layered on top of one another. This gives the eye a chance to rest instead of jumping back and forth between busy prints. Prints that are similar in scale but come in slightly different colors can layer beautifully. This is a great way to mix prints if you're after a more conservative, monochrome look that works as well in the office as it does on a weekend.  For example, if you have a peach and white polka dotted top, trying pairing it with a black and white polka dotted skirt. At home, try working with 2 - 3 different plaid prints in one room. Another great way to incorporate a variety of prints is to choose one that's bold and another that's low-contrast, such as a neutral-toned ikat print. This allows you to create an interesting, finished look without too many overwhelming colors or prints.",
      "Stripes are so easy to mix with other prints that they may as well be considered a neutral, like denim or black. When you're at a loss as to how to mix a complicated print with another one, just pick your favorite color from the print and find a striped version of that color to add as a second layer. Believe it or not, stripes match everything from paisley to ikat to polka dots, so when in doubt, let them be your fallback. Round polka dots offset the straight lines in plaids and stripes, adding interest to any outfit or room. Choose large dots and small lines or large lines and small dots, but remember not to mix two prints of similar scale. Style experts often say that \"animal on animal\" is the way to go when mixing prints. The organic patterns in animal prints like leopard and tiger stripes naturally look great together. Don't be afraid to use contrasting colors when you're mixing similar animal prints! You can't go wrong when you mix two different black and white prints, so this is a great option for beginner print mixers. Black and white polka dots look brilliant with black and white stripes or gingham. You can go bold with your print choices if your color scheme is black and white. If you're just not sure if those floral pants are going to look right with your paisley top, try experimenting with print mixing using accessories at first. For example, introduce a bold new print to your wardrobe in the form of a scarf or belt instead of a blouse. Wear a pair of patterned earrings instead of buying a funky-printed vest to see how it feels to mix prints. At home, go crazy with throw pillows, framed pictures and throws before you splurge on new wallpaper or reupholster your sofa. Once you get used to mixing and matching prints, you'll start sensing what works and what clashes."

      "While you may want to allow your students to contribute to the classroom rules, it's important to provide the framework for their ideas. Start by telling your students about the goals you have for them or your vision for the classroom. Then ask them to contribute by suggesting specific behaviors that can help support these goals.  Providing this framework will help ensure that your students do not come up with rules that you do not agree with or that are not conducive to a positive learning environment. For example, if your goal is that everyone will be respected, your students may suggest that everyone wait their turn to speak or that everyone consider other people's feelings before saying something. Remind students to focus on positive rules, rather than negative rules. In addition to encouraging students to brainstorm ideas for meeting the classroom goals, you can also ask them to share some of the challenges they face in school. They may identify problems, such as bullying or distractions in the classroom, which are interfering with their ability to learn.  Once they identify problems, try having students brainstorm potential solutions to those problems. If you have students do this, be sure to show them that you value their input by incorporating at least some of the ideas they came up with into the classroom contract. You may want to consider having students vote on the rules that everyone comes up with an/or giving everyone the opportunity to suggest that a rule be eliminated. Help your students take ownership of the rules that they create by having them use first person pronouns. This will make it more clear to them that they are each individually responsible for upholding the rules.  For example, instruct them to write \"I will consider other people's feelings\" instead of just \"consider other people's feelings\" or \"everyone should consider each other's feelings.\" You can also have them make a list of their rights. This may include things like \"I have the right to express my opinion\" or \"I have the right to feel safe at school.\" This can help them identify problems that need solutions. Once you have finished your discussion and put your contract in writing, have each student sign it. This will symbolize that each student is agreeing to abide by the rules.  You may want to give each student a separate copy or have everyone sign the classroom copy. You may also wish to send a copy of the classroom contract home with each student to be signed by a parent or guardian. This will help promote parental involvement in your classroom. Make a poster or write the classroom rules on the board. No matter how you choose to display them, make sure they are always visible to students. If you are having problems with behavior in your classroom, you can try asking the students to re-read the classroom contract. Having it displayed prominently will make this much easier. Your classroom rules and expectations should never be set in stone. You may find that the rules need to be adjusted as the year progresses, so always be willing to make necessary changes.  Discuss any changes you make with your students so that they understand what the changes are and why they were made. Listen to your students' feedback on the rules. They may recognize before you do that a rule needs to be reworked because it isn't supporting the classroom goals.",
      "If you're not sure where to start with your classroom rules, you can begin by simply writing down all of the specific behaviors that you want to discourage your students from engaging in. Then use this list to craft your rules. Use the specific actions you came up with to develop more general rules. For example, if you don't want your students to talk out of turn or use cellphones during class, your rule could be \"be respectful of the teacher.\" Instead of centering your classroom contract around rules, which typically state actions that are prohibited, give your students something to work towards by establishing goals. The goals can be broad statements such as \"treat everyone with respect.\" This goal inherently prohibits behavior like hitting and name calling without having to spell out each undesired behavior. If you do need to establish specific rules beyond your broader goals, try to use positive language. This will help motivate students to meet the expectations, rather than bombarding them with prohibited activities. For example, \"Keep your work stations neat\" is a better rule than \"Don't make a mess.\" It's extremely important that your students understand what is expected of them, or else they will never be able to follow the rules. When crafting your rules, do your best to make them clear and concise, while leaving no room for misinterpretation.  Avoid using confusing words that your students may not know. If your rule seems vague, be sure to give examples so your students understand what it means. Talk to them about what works best in their classroom, as well as what hasn't worked. Not only will this give you ideas about what to include in your classroom contract, it can also prevent discrepancies between classrooms that could create conflict, as students will favor a more permissive teacher. It's better for both students and teachers if there are uniform expectations across classrooms. This will provide the students with a stable, clearly structured learning environment.",
      "Some schools have very structured policies regarding the consequences that a student should face for breaking the rules. Others have general guidelines, but give teachers more freedom to decide on the appropriate consequences. As you are establishing your classroom rules or contract, be sure to consider the policies that are already in place at your school, and make sure your classroom rules complement them.  Do not make exceptions to school-wide policies. For example, if your school prohibits all cell phone use, do not state in your contract that cell phone are allowed at certain times. In addition to outlining the expectations you have of your students, it is important to let them know what the consequences will be if they do not meet those expectations. There should never be any surprises when it comes to punishment. Make it clear if there will be a warning for the first offence. Keep in mind that this may be appropriate for some behaviors (like talking out of turn), but not for others (like hitting another student). Remind them that they signed the contract. Then have them identify which rule they broke. Ask them to articulate why this rule is important. Finally, have them identify what the consequence for breaking the rule is. When establishing rules and consequences in your classroom, it's important to be mindful about implementing them consistently. All undesirable behavior should be dealt with in the same way, whether it comes from the worst student in class or the best. Singling out \"bad kids\" will only make their behavior worse, so try to make them feel like they are the same as every other student in the class. Try not to focus so much on punishing students for bad behavior that you forget to reward them for meeting your expectations. Be sure to praise students for good behavior as well. Don't rely too heavily on external rewards, like stickers or pizza parties, as the students' interest in these rewards will eventually fade. The most motivating incentive for students to follow the classroom rules is the opportunity to be a part of a great classroom community."

      "Dill thrives in nutrient-rich soil that drains well and will not form puddles. Select a pot or planter with holes in the bottom (so the soil can drain well), and fill it at least ¾ full with soil. The pot or planter should be deep, at least 10 inches (25 cm), to give the dill’s deep roots enough room to expand.  You can purchase planting soil at a local plant nursery or hardware store. When grown in the outdoors, dill can stand fairly poor soil. Compost will give the sprouting dill seeds much-needed nutrition, and help them grow well and produce plenty of leaves. Use a trowel or your hands to mix the compost and soil together in the pot or planter before adding the seeds. You can purchase potting compost at a local plant nursery. Dill seeds should not be planted deeply. Use your finger to press each individual dill seed into the soil in your pot. Then run your fingers or a small hand-held rake through the soil, so that the dill seeds are lightly covered with soil. If you’re planning to plant multiple dill seeds, give each one plenty of space so that the stalks and branches of the full-grown plants don’t become entangled. Due to this large distance, you’ll need a large planter if you’d like to grow several dill plants. Dill should sprout in 10-14 days. Once the seeds have started to sprout, do not replant the dill plants.",
      "When grown indoors, dill plants prefer temperatures on the cool side. So, adjust your indoor thermostat so that the temperatures hover around the low 70s. Dill plants may wilt and die if left in high temperatures for too long. Dill thrives in full sunlight. Place the plant in a south-facing window, or on a porch or patio that receives full sun for several hours a day. If left for weeks without enough sunlight, the dill will wither. As the dill grows, its stalk may not be strong enough to support the plants own weight. Help the plant by placing a stake in the soil near its base once the plant is about 1 foot (0.30 m) tall. Over time, the dill will grow around the stake. Purchase a stake at a local hardware store or plant nursery. The stake doesn’t have to be made from any special material. A dowel would suffice, as would any firm piece of wood at least 2 feet (0.61 m) tall. If the soil feels dry, water the plant until water runs into the dish beneath the pot or planter. Water by pouring the water directly onto the soil from a height of 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm). This becomes important once the dill stalk reaches 2 feet (0.61 m), because the leaves could mildew if watered from overhead. To see if the dill needs watering, press your finger into the soil: it should be damp, but not muddy or soaking wet.",
      "Once the dill plants are mature, you can harvest the herb at any time. Or, check the calendar (assuming that you marked down when you planted the seeds). Dill will be mature about 8 weeks after the seeds were planted. Use a pair of sharp household scissors to cut the leafy, edible part off of the stem. The edible part of the dill plant is the feathery, light leaves. You can harvest as much of the dill at once as you like, since taking a large harvest won’t damage the plant. Once the leaves are harvested, use the scissors to cut the dill leaves up as finely as you like.  If you don’t have sharp scissors, you can use your thumb and index finger to pinch the leafy parts of the dill off of the stems. While dill seeds are edible, they’re used for different culinary purposes than the leaves. Unlike many other herbs, fresh dill and dried dill have markedly different tastes. If you prefer the taste of fresh dill, only harvest as much as you’ll eat over the span of a few days. If you plan to store some dill, keep it in an airtight container like a plastic bag. This will maintain the herb’s fresh flavor. Fresh dill will keep for a period of 2 weeks. Dried dill is also commonly stored in a small glass jar and kept in the household spice drawer or spice rack."

      ". Nobody feels happy when they’re sick! Even doing something as simple as taking a multivitamin with vitamins C, E, and A, selenium, and beta-carotene might help to boost your immunity. Having a strong immune system allows you to respond better to stress or physical illness. Other strategies such as regular exercise, getting adequate rest, and maintaining a healthy diet are also important for boosting immunity. . Exercising affects the release of endorphins, which transmit messages to the brain, translating into positive feelings. Regular exercise not only combats depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness, but also strengthens your immune system. Even walking for exercise can increase your antibody and T-killer cell response. . Sleep is strongly linked to a person’s health, stress levels, weight and quality of life. Moreover, while you sleep, your body produces cells that fight infection, inflammation, and stress, which means that getting too little sleep makes you more prone to getting sick and increases the time you need to recover from illness.  Exercising is one of the absolute best ways to sleep better at night. Scientists are finding that friendly bacteria in the soil actually trigger the brain to produce serotonin (much like how antidepressants work). If you have a garden, get out there and dig. If you don’t, consider starting one – if not for flowers, for vegetables and herbs that you can use in making healthy recipes. Even designing a container garden can create a spot of sunshine in your life. Obviously, not-so-friendly bacteria are also in your garden. Wear gloves to protect your hands, especially if you have cats or if neighboring cats use your garden as a toilet. And wash your hands well after playing in dirt! . It’s a no-brainer that eating well (fresh, unprocessed, real foods) has a huge variety of health benefits. In addition, taking the time to cook fresh foods for yourself gives you an emotional boost: it smells good, it looks good, it tastes good, and, when you become proficient at cooking, it can even provide a fun, creative break from your routine. In addition to being a form of self-pampering, cooking is also good for your wallet. If you’re new to it, start with a few fast, foolproof recipes that won’t turn you off cooking forever. The less processed foods in your diet, the healthier you'll be, which in turn will ensure a good deal more happiness for you.",
      "You don’t need a clinician to tell you that stress is no fun, but did you know that even a mild stress-induced mood disorder like sub-clinical depression can wreak havoc on your immune system? In fact, the duration of a stressful period has more effect on immunity than its severity.To fight stress, first recognize it and stop trying to battle it alone. Find ways to ground yourself and to let off steam constructively. Sports, exercise, a hobby and spending time with friends are all good ways to counteract stress. You might like to try guided imagery, yoga, or tai-chi; if you have a severe mood disorder, seek counseling and/or medication. Can you change the cause of the stress? Then, do so. In many cases though, stress links back to your job, money, or family. In uncertain times, changing jobs can be difficult, in which case, you must find ways to manage it better.  Managing stress that comes from work or family can be done by being more assertive about your needs and setting boundaries. Assertion and boundary-setting include learning to say \"no\" to tasks that overload your schedule, getting regular \"me\" time, and avoiding taking work calls when you are relaxing at home with family or friends, or vice versa.  Other ways to manage work-related stress consist of working smarter not harder, which means breaking down larger tasks into smaller increments and delegating tasks to others, if necessary. Also, make sure to use workplace resources like trainings and professional development events to counteract detrimental practices that may impact your health and well-being. Getting a higher education can bolster your self-esteem and interest in the world. But it's not for everyone and it's not the only solution. Reading, traveling, taking fun classes, attending guest lectures, and meeting people from other cultures will do the same thing. Or try MOOCs––massive online open courses––these courses offer very stimulating ways of stretching your knowledge and abilities, in your own time. Ultimately, instead of running from new experiences, engage in them, and seek more whenever you can. After all, you only live once. . Whether you choose stamp collecting or kickboxing, hobbies and extracurricular activities are necessary for the pursuit to enjoy life. Hard routines are counterproductive to spontaneity and surprise––leave a little flexibility in your schedule so that it doesn't become routine and humdrum. Do your hobby or activity because you love it, and because it gets you \"into the flow\", and not for reasons such as keeping up with other people or conforming to unrealistic social standards. Research demonstrates that participating in leisure activities can have a positive impact on your physical and mental health and wellness. Benefits of hobbies include lower blood pressure, less cortisol, lower body mass index and greater perception of physical abilities. Putting your feet up and watching your favorite show at the end of the day is definitely a treat, but since passively watching a story doesn’t do much to stimulate your imagination, it can also leave you feeling restless and 'zombified'. For a change of pace, find a book that you can lose yourself in for a while. If you don’t consider yourself much of a reader, think outside the box and find something that relates to your hobbies: if you’re a baseball fan, pick up Bill Veeck’s autobiography; if you’re a biker, try Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Keep notes of passages or ideas that really resonate with you. If you keep a notebook in your usual reading spot, ready to jot down such inspirations, you'll soon amass an inspirational collection of ideas that matter to you and may help direct your sense of purpose for years to come. Meditation reduces stress and promotes a calm feeling. Participating in a few minutes of meditation daily can promote a positive outlook and keep you feeling balanced and relaxed. It is important to maintain a good body posture and perform meditation in a distraction-free zone.",
      "Owning a pet provides love, companionship, and hours of entertainment. Pet ownership has health benefits, too, such as reducing your blood pressure and the risk of heart disease, increasing your feelings of well-being and connectedness, and teaching you lessons in empathy and nurturing.  For extra warm and fuzzy feelings, consider rescuing a pet from your local shelter. However, only get a pet if you know you can take care of it knowledgeably. Don't just keep an animal for your own benefit. Listening to music taps into your brain’s imagination and sense of self-identity, boosts your self-esteem, and lessens feelings of isolation. Listening to music feels empowering. Put on your favorite album – or that one you keep meaning to dive into, turn up the volume, and cut out all other distractions so that you can really experience the wonders of the music. In some cases, music has been shown to help people coping with dementia, giving them a greater sense of empowerment. Music therapy is also useful in people suffering from anxiety and depression. Your facial expression is traditionally thought of as a window into how you feel, but it's also thought that your facial expression can influence your mood. Therefore, be sure to smile freely, to ensure that your mood is upbeat. You might even want to greet yourself in the mirror with a smile first thing in the morning––that happy face may be just enough to keep that mood flowing all day long. A decent break doesn’t mean zoning out to the TV or going down the internet rabbit hole. It means setting some time aside and making it special. As a thank-you to yourself, give yourself a vacation or “staycation”, a change of scenery – even if it just means having a picnic in your backyard or building a fort with your kids in the living room. Taking a break that is different from the ordinary and lets you \"hang loose\" can do wonders for your sense of fun, escape, and fulfillment. It is well known that people with a wide circle of friends tend to live longer.Of course, birds of a feather flock together, and it’s also been shown that your friends’ behavior can actually have a big impact on yours. Make sure you hang around with positive, interesting people to inspire yourself to live a richer life.  Are you putting off getting in touch with an old friend? Make that call today! If you can’t reach the person by phone, set some time aside to write a long email, or go old-school and pen a letter. Do you feel like you are being dragged down by an unhealthy friendship? Enabling your friend’s bad behavior doesn’t do either of you any good. Do some soul-searching and decide whether to resolve things with a heart-to-heart or to simply end the relationship. Are you having trouble meeting new people? Get outside your comfort zone by going to new places, striking up conversations with strangers, taking on a new hobby, or even joining a social activity group on something like Meetup.com."

      "Being well-rested can drastically improve your appearance. Most adults need about eight hours of sleep, but teenagers can require up to ten. Staying fully hydrated will make you look better by clearing up your skin, improving the health of your hair and nails, and keeping your body healthy. If you mostly drink soda, coffee, or juice, try replacing some of them with water until you are drinking at least 8 cups (1,900 ml)  daily. Alcohol, caffeine, cigarettes, and drugs are especially bad for your appearance and health. Be sure you shower every day and clean yourself thoroughly with soap and water. How often you wash your hair will depend on your hair type, but you should at least clean your body daily. You should use a moisturizer on your face and body every day, even if you have oily skin--moisturizer will stop your skin from producing its own oils. You can use any kind, but check the label first to see if it’s the best kind for your skin type. You don’t have to put on a new shade of nail polish every day, but your nails should be clean and manicured all the time. Clip and file your nails so they are even and clean under them daily. If you wear polish, check for chips every day and fix them if you have polish on hand. Biting your nails is the best way to break them and make them weaker. Refrain for biting them at all costs. Dip your hands in lemon or rub lemon on your nails and fingertips so if you feel the urge to bite them you will taste lemons. Keep your hair brushed and styled every single day. Make sure your hair doesn't have any knots or tangles, and that it is neat and clean. If your hair gets flat and oily by the end of the day, try to wash it every day; otherwise, every other day is fine. Smelling nice is an essential part of being pretty! Be sure you use deodorant every single day. You can also wear perfume--many people have a signature scent they wear every day. If you don’t wear much perfume, try a light floral or fruit scent first. But always be careful to not wear too much.   Don’t use deodorant or perfume as a substitute for bathing. People can tell. Use as little perfume as possible, and only use it on pulse points like your wrists and neck. Your perfume should be a subtle fragrance that people only notice when they’re next to you, not a strong smell that hangs in the air around you. Pretty people keep their teeth as clean as possible. Brush and floss at least twice a day, and be sure to use mouthwash or mints to keep your breath smelling fresh. Carry floss with you, and use it after every meal or snack. It’s okay if your teeth are crooked or if you wear braces. Just make sure they’re clean and white. It’s hard to imagine a pretty person slouching! Practice sitting with your back straight against a chair and walking with your chin parallel to the ground. It will make you look more confident and attractive! If you aren’t happy with your looks, try wearing a little bit of makeup. Light makeup will help you accentuate your best features, and it’s much easier to learn to apply than a full face of makeup. Keep practicing until your makeup looks natural and is easy for you to apply. Wearing clothes that are wrinkled or stained can make you look messy, unattractive, or even dirty. Iron your clothes before wearing them and be sure they’re clean when you put them on.  Read the instructions on your clothing labels. Some clothes can’t be ironed or can only be ironed on a low setting. If you don’t want to iron, try hanging clothes up immediately after you dry them, or letting them run in a dryer on the permanent press cycle. You don’t have to wear the latest trends to be pretty. A great shortcut is to make sure all your clothes fit you properly. Don’t wear clothes that are too tight or too baggy. None of your clothes should be so tight that they pinch you, show your underwear, or are hard to put on and take off. They also shouldn't hang loosely off your shoulders or hips, or need to be adjusted as you go about your day. If you still feel hopeless about your looks, you might just need a little outside perspective. Call your local makeup store, hair salon, or beauty counter and schedule a makeover. They’ll be able to teach you tricks and techniques you hadn’t considered before, and you’ll go home looking great!  If you can’t afford a professional makeover, ask a friend or relative who’s into makeup and beauty to help you. Don’t feel intimidated about going into a makeup shop or hair salon. They've seen everything and they’re here to help you.",
      "A great way to improve your confidence and begin to feel pretty is to take a little bit of time every day to say something positive about yourself. You can set an alarm for the same time to remind you, or even just practice saying something positive every time you think something negative about yourself. Try saying something like “My eye color is beautiful” or “I did a great job putting together this outfit today” or “I did great on that algebra test.” If you ignore or shut down other people’s compliments, they’ll think you don’t want to hear anything good about yourself. When somebody says something good about you, resist the urge to say something like “No, you’re wrong.” Instead, say “Thank you! That really means a lot to me.” You are a unique individual, and nobody has the same life and the same circumstances as you. Don’t worry too much about what other people are doing or what they have that you don’t. If you start to compare yourself to others, tell yourself that you’re a different person and you have your own set of positive qualities. A great way to build confidence is to branch out and try new things every chance you get. It doesn’t have to be anything huge--it can be as easy as wearing a new hat or taking a different route to school. Make a goal to try something new every single day.  If you usually wear dark or neutral-colored clothes, try wearing a bright blue top one day. Join a new club at school. Order something different at your favorite restaurant. Selfies are a great way to boost your confidence. Spend some time snapping a few dozen photos of yourself. Look through them and pick out the one you like the best. You don’t have to post it, but you can still decorate it with a filter or sticker. It’s totally normal to hate some of your selfies! Even supermodels have outtakes they don’t want anyone to see. It’s normal for it to take awhile to start feeling confident. If you’re trying to improve your confidence but aren't feeling it yet, try faking confidence! It sounds silly, but if you act confident all the time, you’ll soon find that you really are confident.",
      "Lots of people who aren't necessarily great-looking have an inner beauty that radiates and attracts others. Practice your inner beauty by smiling and making eye contact with the people you encounter every day. It doesn't matter if you know them or not--everyone likes a smile! Many people interpret smiling and making eye contact as an invitation to chat. If you’re in a hurry or don’t want to talk, be sure to make the eye contact last for only a second. Be nice to everyone you meet. Introduce yourself if you don’t know them, and address them by name. Ask how they’re doing and take an active interest in their lives. This doesn’t mean that you should let people treat you badly--if you have to tell someone to stop or to leave you alone, do so clearly and firmly. If you care about someone, let them know how you feel. You can simply say “I care about you” or “I love you”, but it doesn't have to be direct. You can also show them how you feel by paying attention to them, listening to any problems they have, and making time for them.  Tell your parents that you appreciate all they do for you. Text your best friend a note saying she's awesome and the best friend ever. People are more likely to find a helpful person attractive and enjoyable to be around. If you are in a situation where you can help someone, do it! Offer to open doors, carry boxes, or help someone with their homework. Don’t go overboard. You shouldn't offer to help do something if you aren't fully up to the job.. Offering to help too often can lead to burnout and being taken advantage of. Pretty people don’t just sit back and reflect on how pretty they are. They look for beauty in other people too! Look at the people you care about and the people you interact with, and find something nice to say about everyone’s appearance. Once you get into the habit of looking for beauty in others, you’ll be able to see it in yourself too. You don’t have to walk up to people and announce “You’re pretty.” Try saying something like “I like your haircut” or “You look nice today.”"

      "While researchers have identified some correlations between certain factors and the development or triggering of schizophrenia, the exact cause of schizophrenia is still unknown. Discuss your family history and medical background with your doctor or mental health provider. Schizophrenia is at least partially genetic. Your risk for developing schizophrenia is about 10% higher if you have at least one “first-degree” family member (e.g., parent, sibling) with the disorder.  If you have an identical twin with schizophrenia, or if both of your parents have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, your risk of developing it yourself is more like 40-65%. However, about 60% of people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia do not have close relatives who have schizophrenia. If another family member -- or you -- has another disorder similar to schizophrenia, such as a delusional disorder, you may be at higher risk for developing schizophrenia. Infants who are exposed to viruses, toxins, or malnutrition while in the womb may be more likely to develop schizophrenia. This is especially true if the exposure happened in the first and second trimesters.  Infants who experience a lack of oxygen during birth may also be more likely to develop schizophrenia. Infants who are born during a time of famine are more than twice as likely to develop schizophrenia. This may be because malnourished mothers cannot get enough nutrients during their pregnancy. Some studies have shown a correlation between the age of the father and the risk for developing schizophrenia. One study showed that children whose fathers who were 50 years old or older when they were born were 3 times as likely to develop schizophrenia as those whose fathers were 25 years old or younger. It is thought that this may be because the older the father is, the more likely his sperm is to develop genetic mutations.",
      "It can be hard to identify some things, such as delusions, in yourself. Ask your family and friends to help you figure out whether you are displaying these symptoms. Write down when you think you may be having hallucinations or other symptoms. Keep track of what happened just before or during these episodes. This will help you figure out how commonly these things occur. It will also help when you consult a professional for diagnosis. Schizophrenia, especially in teenagers, can creep up slowly over a period of 6-9 months. If you notice that you're behaving differently and don't know why, talk with a mental health professional. Don’t just “write off” different behaviors as nothing, especially if they are very unusual for you or they’re causing you distress or dysfunction. These changes are signs that something is wrong. That something may not be schizophrenia, but it's important to consider. An online test can't tell you if you have schizophrenia. Only a trained clinician can make an accurate diagnosis after tests, examinations, and interviews with you. However, a trustworthy screening quiz can help you figure out what symptoms you may have and whether they are likely to suggest schizophrenia.  The Counselling Resource Mental Health Library has a free version of the STEPI (Schizophrenia Test and Early Psychosis Indicator) on their website.  Psych Central has an online screening test as well. If you're worried that you might have schizophrenia, talk with your physician or therapist. While they do not usually have the resources to diagnose schizophrenia, a general practitioner or therapist can help you understand more about what schizophrenia is and whether you should see a psychiatrist. Your physician can also help you rule out other causes of symptoms, such as injury or illness.",
      "The second criterion for a schizophrenia diagnosis is “social/occupational dysfunction.” This dysfunction must be present for a significant portion of the time since you began displaying symptoms. Many conditions can cause dysfunction in your work and social life, so even if you’re experiencing trouble in one or more of these areas, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have schizophrenia. One or more areas of “major” functioning must be impaired:  Work/Academics Interpersonal relations Self-care One of the criteria for “dysfunction” is whether you are able to fulfill the requirements of your job. If you’re a full-time student, your ability to perform in school could be considered. Consider the following:  Do you feel psychologically able to leave the house to go to work or school? Have you had a hard time coming in on time or showing up regularly? Are there parts of your work that you now feel afraid to do? If you are a student, is your academic performance suffering? This should be considered in light of what is normal for you. If you’ve always been a reserved person, not wanting to socialize isn’t necessarily a sign of dysfunction. However, if you’ve noticed your behaviors and motivations change to things that aren’t “normal” for you, this could be something to speak with a mental health professional about.  Do you enjoy the same relationships you used to? Do you enjoy socializing in the way you used to? Do you feel like talking with others significantly less than you used to? Do you feel afraid or intensely worried about interacting with others? Do you feel like you're being persecuted by others, or that others have ulterior motives toward you? “Self-care” refers to your ability to take care of yourself and remain healthy and functional. This should also be judged within the realm of “normal for you.” So, for example, if you usually work out 2-3 times per week but haven’t felt like going in 3 months, this could be a sign of disturbance. The following behaviors are also signs of lapsed self-care:  You have started or increased abusing substances such as alcohol or drugs You don’t sleep well, or your sleep cycle varies widely (e.g., 2 hours one night, 14 hours the next, etc.) You don’t “feel” as much, or you feel “flat” Your hygiene has gotten worse You don’t take care of your living space",
      "In order to diagnose schizophrenia, a mental health clinician will first look for symptoms in five “domains”: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and thinking, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and negative symptoms (symptoms that reflect a reduction in behavior). You must have at least 2 (or more) of these symptoms. Each must be present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (less if the symptoms have been treated). At least 1 of the minimum 2 symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. Delusions are irrational beliefs that often emerge as a response to a perceived threat that is largely or entirely unconfirmed by other people.  Delusions are maintained despite evidence that they are not true.  There’s a difference between delusions and suspicions. Many people will occasionally have irrational suspicions, such as believing a co-worker is “out to get them” or that they’re having an “unlucky streak.” The difference is whether these beliefs cause you distress or make it hard to function. For example, if you are so convinced that the government is spying on you that you refuse to leave your house to go to work or school, that is a sign that your belief is causing dysfunction in your life.  Delusions may sometimes be bizarre, such as believing you’re an animal or a supernatural being. If you find yourself convinced of something beyond the usual realms of possibility, this could be a sign of delusions (but is certainly not the only possibility). Hallucinations are sensory experiences that seem real, but are created in your mind. Common hallucinations may be auditory (things you hear), visual (things you see), olfactory (things you smell), or tactile (things you feel, such as the creepy-crawlies on your skin). Hallucinations may affect any of your senses. For example, consider whether you frequently experience the sensation of things crawling over your body. Do you hear voices when no one is around? Do you see things that “shouldn’t” be there, or that no one else sees? Having a belief that others may see as “strange” does not mean you’re having delusions. Similarly, seeing things that others may not is not always a dangerous hallucination. Beliefs can only be judged as “delusional” or dangerous in accordance with local cultural and religious norms. Beliefs and visions are usually only considered signs of psychosis or schizophrenia if they create unwanted or dysfunctional obstacles in your daily life.  For example, a belief that wicked actions will be punished by “fate” or “karma” might seem delusional to some cultures but not to others.  What count as hallucinations are also related to cultural norms. For example, children in many cultures can experience auditory or visual hallucinations -- such as hearing the voice of a deceased relative -- without being considered psychotic, and without developing psychosis later in life.  Highly religious people may be more likely to see or hear some things, such as hearing the voice of their deity or seeing an angel. Many belief systems accept these experiences as genuine and productive, even something to be sought after. Unless the experience distresses or endangers the person or others, these visions are not generally a cause for concern. Disorganized speech and thinking are basically what they sound like. It may be difficult for you to answer questions effectively or fully. Answers may be tangential, fragmented, or incomplete. In many cases, disorganized speech is accompanied by the inability or unwillingness to sustain eye contact or use non-verbal communication, such as gestures or other body language. You may need the help of others to know whether this is happening.  In the most severe cases, speech may be “word salad,” strings of words or ideas that are not related and do not make sense to listeners.  As with other symptoms in this section, you must consider “disorganized” speech and thinking must be considered within your own social and cultural context. For example, some religious beliefs hold that individuals will speak in strange or unintelligible language when in contact with a religious figure. Furthermore, narratives are structured very differently across cultures, so stories told by people in one culture may appear “weird” or “disorganized” to an outsider who is unfamiliar with those cultural norms and traditions.  Your language is likely to be “disorganized” only if others who are familiar with your religious and cultural norms cannot understand or interpret it (or it occurs in situations in which your language “should” be understandable). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior can manifest in a number of ways. You may feel unfocused, which makes it hard to perform even simple tasks such as washing your hands. You may feel agitated, silly, or excited in unpredictable ways. “Abnormal” motor behavior may be inappropriate, unfocused, excessive, or purposeless. For example, you might frantically wave your hands around or adopt a strange posture. Catatonia is another sign of abnormal motor behavior. In severe cases of schizophrenia, you may remain still and silent for days on end. Catatonic individuals will not respond to external stimuli, such as conversation or even physical prompting, such as touching or poking. Negative symptoms are symptoms that show a “decrease” or reduction in “normal” behaviors. For example, a decrease in emotional range or expression would be a “negative symptom.” So would a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, or a lack of motivation to do things.  Negative symptoms may also be cognitive, such as difficulty concentrating. These cognitive symptoms are usually more self-destructive and more obvious to others than the inattentiveness or concentration trouble typically seen in people diagnosed with ADHD.  Unlike ADD or ADHD, these cognitive difficulties will occur across most types of situations that you encounter, and they cause significant problems for you in many areas of your life.",
      "To diagnose schizophrenia, a mental health professional will ask you how long the disturbances and symptoms have been going on. To qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the disturbance must have been in effect for at least 6 months.  This period must include at least 1 month of “active-phase” symptoms from Part 1 (Criterion A), although the 1-month requirement may be less if symptoms have been treated. This 6-month period may also include periods of “prodromal” or residual symptoms. During these periods, the symptoms may be less extreme (i.e., “attenuated”) or you may experience only “negative symptoms” such as feeling less emotion or not wanting to do anything. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features can cause symptoms very similar to some of those in schizophrenia. Other illnesses or physical traumas, such as strokes and tumors, can cause psychotic symptoms. This is why it is crucial to seek help from a trained mental health clinician. You cannot make these distinctions on your own.  Your clinician will ask if you have had major depressive or manic episodes at the same time as your “active-phase” symptoms. A major depressive episode involves at least one of the following for a period of at least 2 weeks: depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy. It will also include other regular or near-constant symptoms in that time frame, such as significant weight changes, disruption in sleeping patterns, fatigue, agitation or slowing down, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, trouble concentrating and thinking, or recurrent thoughts about death. A trained mental health professional will help you determine whether you have experienced a major depressive episode. A manic episode is a distinct period of time (usually at least 1 week) when you experience an abnormally elevated, irritated, or expansive mood. You will also display at least three other symptoms, such as decreased need for sleep, inflated ideas of yourself, flighty or scattered thoughts, distractibility, increased involvement in goal-directed activities, or an excessive involvement in pleasurable activities, especially those with a high risk or potential for negative consequences. A trained mental health professional will help you determine whether you have experienced a manic episode. You will also be asked how long these mood episodes lasted during your “active-phase” symptoms. If your mood episodes were brief in comparison to how long the active and residual periods lasted, this may be a sign of schizophrenia. Substance use, such as drugs or alcohol, can cause symptoms similar to those in schizophrenia. When diagnosing you, your clinician will make sure that the disturbances and symptoms you’re experiencing are not because of the “direct physiological effects” of a substance, such as an illegal drug or medication.  Even legal, prescribed medications can cause side effects such as hallucinations. It’s important for a trained clinician to diagnose you so that s/he can distinguish between side effects from a substance and symptoms of an illness. Substance use disorders (commonly known as “substance abuse”) commonly co-occur with schizophrenia. Many people suffering from schizophrenia may attempt to “self-medicate” their symptoms with medication, alcohol, and drugs. Your mental health professional will help you determine if you have a substance use disorder. This is another element that must be handled by a trained clinician. Global Developmental Delay or Autism Spectrum Disorder may cause some symptoms that are similar to those in schizophrenia. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or other communication disorders that begin in childhood, a diagnosis of schizophrenia will only be made if there are prominent delusions or hallucinations present. The criteria for schizophrenia and many other psychiatric diagnoses are what as known as polythetic. This means that there are many ways of interpreting the symptoms, and different ways the symptoms may combine and appear to others. Diagnosing schizophrenia can be difficult even for trained professionals.  It is also possible, as mentioned before, that your symptoms could be the result of another trauma, illness, or disorder. You must seek professional medical and mental health help to properly diagnose any disorder or disease. Cultural norms and local and personal idiosyncrasies in thought and speech can affect whether your behavior appears “normal” to others."

      "Loneliness is when you are unhappy to be alone. Solitude is when you are happy to be alone. There is nothing wrong with solitude, wanting to, or enjoying being alone. Alone time can be useful and enjoyable. Usually, when we're devoting most of our time to other people, we tend to neglect ourselves. If you're going through a period of loneliness, take advantage of it by doing the things that you want to do for yourself. This is a wonderful opportunity and you deserve to be happy! Working out and taking care of our bodies is usually the first thing that gets tossed aside when we get busy. If you're spending less time with other people than normal, try using that time to exercise. If you exercise at a gym, you might even meet some new friends or a new special someone! Taking time to indulge in a new hobby can help you to overcome feelings of loneliness, even if you are doing the hobby by yourself. You could learn to play an instrument, learn to draw, or learn to dance. Going and learning these subjects with others may help you meet new people but it will also give you a creative outlet for your feelings. Turn your loneliness into something beautiful!  Cook yourself a nice meal or make baked goods for friends or neighbors. Cooking up a meal is rewarding, you can channel your focus into something nourishing. Consider joining a club to meet other people who enjoy this hobby as well. People oftentimes have something really big that they want to do and a thousand excuses not to do it. Have you ever wanted to write a book? Make a movie? Use your loneliness as an excuse to do something great. Who knows, maybe it will turn into something that helps others deal with their loneliness...",
      "To make new friends, you will have to get out and get involved in things. Consider joining a sports league, taking a class, or volunteering within your community. If you are very shy, find a group for social anxiety, even if it has to be online. Look on places like Craigslist, Meetup, or local news websites for activities in your area. Don't attend functions with the sole idea of making friends or meeting people. Try to go with no expectations whatsoever and to enjoy yourself regardless of what happens. Look for activities that interest you and that also involve groups of people like book clubs, church groups, political campaigns, concerts and art exhibitions Making new friends often requires you to take the first step and invite others out to do things. Don't wait for people to approach you: you should approach them. Ask the person if they want to chat or get a coffee. You must always show interest in other people before they will show interest in you.  Be yourself as you try to make new friends.  Don’t try to impress a new person by misrepresenting yourself. That may lead to the end of the new friendship before it even gets started. Be a good listener.  Pay close attention when people are talking. It is important to be able to respond to what the person has just said to demonstrate that you were listening or they may feel like you do not care. Working to deepen the relationships with your family may also help you to stop feeling so lonely. Even if you don't have a great history with a family member, you can still try to repair relationships by starting with an invitation. For example, you could ask a family member that you haven’t seen in a while to go out to lunch or meet you for coffee. When trying to rebuild or deepen your relationships with family members, you can use some of the same strategies you would use to gain new friends. Take the initiative to ask the person out, be yourself, and be a good listener. Draw people toward yourself by providing enjoyable company. Be complimentary rather than critical. For a casual comment, don't nitpick other people's clothes, habits or hair. They don't need to be reminded they have a small stain on their shirt when they can't do anything about it. They do need to hear that you think their sweater is cool or you like their personality. Don't make a big deal of it, but just casually mention it when you like something. This is one of the best ice-breakers around and it builds trust steadily over time as people come to understand that you won't criticize them. Sometimes connecting with people online can be easier than connecting with them in person, but keep in mind that online interaction is not an equal substitution for face-to-face connections. However, sometime online communities can be valuable ways for you to share your thoughts and experiences, or ask questions to those who are going through similar situations. Online forums often allow you to help others while being helped yourself. Remember to be safe when online. Not everyone is who they say they are and predators feed off loneliness.",
      "Loneliness is a normal part of being human, but it can make you feel like you are abnormal. Reach out to a friend or family member and talk with that person about how you are feeling. As you tell someone about your feelings, you can also ask if they have had these feelings too. This process of reaching out and sharing with someone will help you to see that you are not alone.  Try saying something like, “Lately I have been feeling lonely and I wondered if you have ever felt this way.” If you do not have a friend or family member to talk to, reach out to a teacher, counselor, or pastor. Instead of persistently dwelling on how alone you feel, do things to get your mind off of your loneliness. Take a walk, ride your bike or read a book. Explore activities and hobbies, and don't be afraid to try new things. Having experience gives you a basis upon which you can comment in more social situations (thus talk to more people) and strike up conversations that will interest other people. Keep yourself busy. Having down time is what causes feelings of loneliness to creep in. Throw yourself into work or extracurricular activities. If you don’t have someone to go out with all of the time, don’t let that stop you from getting out and enjoying yourself. For example, if you want to go out to dinner or to a movie on a date, then take yourself out to a movie or to a nice restaurant. Although, at first, it may seem awkward to be doing things by yourself that you might normally do with someone else, don't hold yourself back. It is not strange to be by yourself and out doing things! Once you remember why you did these things before, you can enjoy the activity for itself again.  Take a book, magazine, or journal with you if you go out to eat or have coffee on your own, so you'll be occupied when you would usually be conversing. Bear in mind that people do go out on their own on purpose just to have \"me\" time by themselves; it is not as if people will look at you sitting alone and assume you have no friends. It may take some time to get used to the feeling of being out by yourself. Don’t give up if your first few attempts are a little awkward. If you're truly struggling without companionship, consider adopting a dog or cat from your local animal shelter.  Pets have been domestic companions for centuries for a reason, and winning the trust and affection of an animal can be a deeply rewarding experience. Be a responsible pet owner.  Make sure your pet is spayed or neutered, and only commit to bringing a pet into your life if you're prepared to handle the daily tasks of caring for it.",
      "In order to make changes that will truly help you, you will need to take some time to figure out why you are feeling lonely. For example, say you assume that you are lonely because you don’t have enough friends and you go out and make more friends. You may still feel lonely after making new friends if your loneliness is the result of having too many friends and a lack of meaningful connections. Consider some of the following questions to help you determine why you are feeling lonely:  When do you feel the most lonely? Do certain people make you feel more lonely when you are around them? How long have you been feeling this way? What does feeling lonely make you want to do? Journaling can help you to understand your feelings of loneliness better and it is also a great way to relieve stress. To get started with journaling, choose a comfortable place and plan to devote about 20 minutes per day to writing. You can start by writing about how you are feeling or what you are thinking, or you can use a prompt. Some prompts you might use include:  “I feel lonely when…” “I feel lonely because…” When did you first start feeling lonely? How long have you felt this way? Some research has suggested that meditation may ease feelings associated with loneliness and depression. Meditation is also a great way to get more in touch with your feelings of loneliness and start to understand where they come from. Learning to meditate takes time, practice, and guidance, so your best bet is to find a meditation class in your area. If no classes are available in your area, you can also buy CDs that will help you learn how to meditate.  To get started with meditation, find a quiet spot and get comfortable. You can either sit in a chair or on a cushion on the floor with your legs crossed. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. As you focus on your breathing, try not to get distracted by your thoughts. Just let them happen and pass by. Without opening your eyes, observe the world around you. Pay attention to how you feel as well. What do you hear? What do you smell? How do you feel? Physically? Emotionally? It may be hard to figure out why you feel lonely and how to move past those feelings. A licensed mental health professional can help you to understand and work through your loneliness. Feeling lonely may indicate that you are depressed or that you have another underlying mental health condition. Talking to a therapist can help you understand what is going on and decide on the best course of action."

      "Planning a Tesla Coil",
      "Making a Tesla Coil"
    ],
    "document": [
      "You can build as large a Tesla coil as your budget allows; however, the lightning-bolt-like sparks Tesla coils generate heat and expand the air around them (in essence, creating thunder). Their electric fields can also play havoc with electronic devices, so you'll probably want to build and run your Tesla coil in an out-of-the-way place, such as a garage or other workshop. You will also want to consider whether it makes more sense to build a Tesla coil from a kit, or gather materials from scratch. Both have advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost, building time, resources for help, and reliability.  To figure how large a spark gap you can accommodate, or how much power you need to make it work, divide the length of the spark gap in inches by 1.7 and square it to determine the input power in watts. (Conversely, to find the spark gap length, multiply the square root of the power in watts by 1.7.) A Tesla coil that creates a spark gap of 60 inches (150 cm) (1.5 meters) would require 1,246 watts. (A Tesla coil using a 1-kilowatt power source would generate a spark gap of almost 54 inches, or 1.37 meters.) Designing and building a Tesla coil requires understanding certain scientific terms and units of measure. You’ll need to understand their purpose and function to properly make a Tesla coil. Here are some of the terms you'll need to know:  Capacitance is the ability to hold an electric charge or the amount of electric charge stored for a given voltage. (A device designed to hold an electric charge is called a capacitor.) The unit of measure for capacitance is the farad (abbreviated \"F\"). A farad is defined as 1 ampere-second (or coulomb) per volt. Commonly, capacitance is measured in smaller units, such as the microfarad (abbreviated \"uF\"), a millionth of a farad, or the picofarad (abbreviated pF and sometimes read as \"puff\"), a trillionth of a farad. Inductance, or self-inductance, is how much voltage an electric circuit carries per the amount of current in the circuit. (High-tension power lines, which carry a high voltage but a low current, have high inductance.) The unit of measure for inductance is the henry (abbreviated \"H\"). A henry is defined as 1 volt-second per ampere of current. Commonly, inductance is measured in smaller units, such as the millihenry (abbreviated \"mH\"), a thousandth of a henry, or the microhenry (abbreviated \"uH\"), a millionth of a henry. Resonant frequency, or resonance frequency, is the frequency at which the resistance to transfer of energy is at a minimum. (For a Tesla coil, this is optimum operating point for transferring electrical energy between the primary and secondary coils.) The unit of measure for the resonant frequency is the hertz (abbreviated \"Hz\"), defined as 1 cycle per second. More commonly, the resonant frequency is measured in kilohertz (abbreviated \"kHz\"), with a kilohertz being equal to 1000 hertz. You'll need a power supply transformer, a high-capacitance primary capacitor, a spark gap assembly, a low-inductance primary inductor coil, a high-inductance secondary inductor coil, a low-capacitance secondary capacitor and something to suppress, or choke, the high-frequency noise pulses created when the Tesla coil operates. For more information on the parts, see the next section, \"Making a Tesla Coil.\" Your power source/transformer feeds power through the chokes to the primary, or tank circuit, which connects the primary capacitor, primary inductor coil and spark gap assembly. The primary inductor coil is placed adjacent to, but not wired to, the inductor coil of the secondary circuit, which is connected to the secondary capacitor. Once the secondary capacitor has built up sufficient electric charge, streamers of electricity (lightning bolts) discharge from it.",
      "Your power supply transformer determines how large you can make your Tesla coil. Most Tesla coils operate with a transformer that puts out a voltage between 5,000 to 15,000 volts at a current between 30 and 100 milliamperes. You can obtain a transformer from a college surplus store or from the Internet, or cannibalize the transformer from a neon sign. The best way to create this capacitor is to wire a number of small capacitors in series so that each capacitor handles an equal share of the total voltage of the primary circuit. (This requires that each individual capacitor have the same capacitance as the other capacitors in the series.) This kind of capacitor is called a multi-mini-capacitor or MMC.  Small capacitors, and their associated bleed resistors, can be obtained from electronics supply stores, or you can scrounge for ceramic capacitors from old television sets. You can also make the capacitors out of sheets of polyethylene and aluminum foil. To maximize the power output, the primary capacitor should be able to reach its full capacitance each half-cycle of the frequency of the power being supplied to it. (For a 60 Hz power supply, this means 120 times each second.) If you're planning on a single spark gap, you'll need metal bolts at least a quarter-inch (6 millimeters) thick to serve as the spark gap to withstand the heat generated by the discharge of electricity between the sparks. You can also wire multiple spark gaps in series, use a rotary spark gap or blow compressed air between the sparks to moderate the temperature. (An old vacuum cleaner can be used to blow the air.) The coil itself will be made of wire, but you'll need something to wrap the wire around in a spiral shape. The wire should be enameled copper wire, which you can obtain from an electrical supply store or by cannibalizing the outlet cord from a discarded appliance. The object you wrap the wire around can be either cylindrical, such as a cardboard or plastic tube, or conical, such as an old lampshade. The length of the cord determines the inductance of the primary coil. The primary coil should have a low inductance, so you'll use comparatively few turns in making it. You can use non-continuous sections of wire for the primary coil, so that you can hook sections together as necessary to adjust the inductance on the fly. This completes the primary circuit. As with the primary coil, you're wrapping wire around a cylindrical shape. The secondary coil must have the same resonant frequency as the primary coil for the Tesla coil to operate efficiently. However, the secondary coil must be taller/longer than the primary coil because it has to have a larger inductance than the primary coil, and also to prevent any electrical discharge from the secondary circuit to strike and fry the primary circuit. If you lack the materials to make the secondary coil tall enough, you can compensate by building a strike rail (essentially a lightning rod) to protect the primary circuit, but this will mean that most of the Tesla coil's discharges will hit the strike rail and not dance in the air. The secondary capacitor, or discharge terminal, can be any round shape, with the 2 most popular being the torus (ring or donut shape) and the sphere. This completes the secondary circuit. Your secondary circuit should be grounded separately from the grounding for your household circuits supplying power to the transformer to prevent a stream of electric current from traveling from the Tesla coil to the ground for your household circuits and possibly frying anything plugged into those outlets. Driving a metal spike into the ground is a good way to do this. Chokes are simple, small inductors that keep the pulses created by the spark gap assembly from wrecking the power supply transformer. You can make one by winding thin copper wire around a narrow tube, such as a disposable ball point pen. Place the primary and secondary circuits next to each other, and connect the power supply transformer to the primary circuit through the chokes. Once you plug the transformer in, your Tesla coil is ready to run. If the primary coil is of sufficiently large diameter, the secondary coil can be set inside it."

    ],
    "document": [
      "Access the National Mortgage Licensing System & Registry (NMLS) to determine whether or not each of your mortgage lenders are licensed in your state. Immediately eliminate from the list those lenders that do not show up on this website. The NMLS can be accessed at http://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org. How a lender acted when you met with them can say a lot about how doing business with them will be later. Look for lenders who were helpful, professional, and willing to answer any questions you had. Did the lender stick to the interest rate they quoted over the phone or online? Do they set forth a timeline for progressing with your loan application (when to lock in rates, etc.)? Eliminate any lenders that seemed shady in any way. Also, pass on the mortgage lenders that did not provide clear written information. Search for each lender online to locate reviews of that lender. There should be sources like Zillow.com and Google local reviews that show up when you search for the lender. Look for higher scores and watch out for any problems other borrowers have run into with that lender. Lenders may be able to waive or lower some of the fees, even those that they originally try to argue are \"necessary.\" For example, you should try to negotiate down the application fee to free or near free, if possible. Additionally, the appraisal fee is a necessary fee, but only if it is within reasonable bounds; you should negotiate down an appraisal fee that is over $500. If you are using a broker to get your loan, you may also be able to negotiate down origination fees and underwriting fees.  Some fees are always non-negotiable. These include recording fees, title insurance, tax-related fees, document stamp fees, and title fees.  Your lender may allow you to pay \"points\" in order to get a lower interest rate. This can lower your house payment, so it may save you money if you're planning to be in your home for a long time. However, it might not be worth it to pay points if you're planning to be in your home for a shorter length of time. For example, you might be able to pay $2,000 to reduce your interest rate by 0.25 percent. This would save you money by reducing your monthly payment by a small amount each month, and would add up over the life of your loan. The lowest rate is not necessarily the best option if there are thousands of dollars more in fees and expenses than a slightly higher interest rate loan. For example, you will be charged an origination fee on your loan. This is a percentage of the total value of the loan and is usually around one percent. If you were offered two loans with the same interest rate of 4.5 percent, but the first charges a 1.5 percent origination fee compared to the second's one percent origination fee, you would be better off choosing the second loan. Compare your lenders' offered interest rates and fees structures for the type of loan you are seeking. Obviously, you should go with the reputable lender that offers you the cheapest combination of interest rates and fees. Understand each loan type the mortgage lender is offering. There's a great deal of difference in a 30-year fixed-rate and a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), mainly that the interest rate in the ARM stands to change unexpectedly. Know the difference and feel confident in the explanation provided by the mortgage lender. Ask them to lock in the interest rate and fees you've negotiated and draw up a contract. Make sure to ask if your good faith estimate rates and fee structure still stand. Make sure you look at the fine print to ensure that you are getting the loan terms and fees that you have negotiated. Pay special attention to what happens if the loan doesn't go through. It is a serious red flag if the \"good faith\" or \"earnest money\" deposit you give the lender in advance is kept by the lender in the event that the loan doesn't go through. Again, ask for an explanation if there are any unexpected fees or confusingly worded statements in the contract.",
      "The more information you are able to provide about your financial status, the easier it will be to maneuver through the mortgage application process. Collect a list of information about your debts and assets and print out a summary that you can show to lenders.  Get an updated credit report. Take care of details that are not correct and pay outstanding debts as much as you can. This will increase your credit score and allow you to get better interest rates.  Make a list of your debts. Include balances owed and account numbers. You'll need this information when you fill out a loan application. Put together a list of all your assets. This should include both checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts and any personal property you own (like cars or boats). There are some basic loan terms that are simple to understand but may be confusing at first to borrowers who are unfamiliar with them. Learn a few of the basic terms so that you understand what your lender is talking about and know what to look for. Your lender should also be able to explain these terms and any other, more complex terms that may show up. For now, start with the following terms:  Annual percentage rate (APR). This is the annual interest rate charged on the loan. Lender fees. These are additional fees (on top of interest) that are paid to the lender at closing. Loan program. This is the general type of mortgage that describes the interest rates and length of the loan's life. Some common loan programs include 15-year fixed mortgage rate or 30-year adjustment rate mortgage (ARM). \"Good Faith\" estimate. This is the initial, pre-approval set of loan terms given to you by a lender. It includes the interest rate and any additional fees that will be charged. It will be difficult to find the right lender if you don't know what kind of mortgage you are looking for. For example, think about how quickly you want to pay off your mortgage. The lives of these loans can vary widely in length, so make sure you know what your plan is. Just make sure to consider that paying off the loan in a shorter time will result in higher monthly payments (but less overall interest paid). Think about specifically what you want to know when applying for a mortgage loan. For example, consider asking what monthly payments would be under a variety of different loan terms. Or, you could ask why certain fees are charged. You can ask any number of things of your lender without even applying for loan, so ask as many questions as you need to. If your lender doesn't take the time to respond to them or is difficult to reach, you may want to seek other lenders.  Keep the questions consistent between lenders so you have a standard of comparison. Ask about special mortgage loans if you think you qualify for them. Special loan programs include VA loans (for veterans of the armed forces), USDA loans (for rural areas), and programs offered by state or local governments. These programs may offer borrowers lower rate or better repayment terms.",
      "Mortgage brokers can give you more options because they're independent from lenders and banks. They'll help you find the lender that has the best loan package. Talk to people you know, your realtor, and your current bank to ask for a recommendation.  Find out how the mortgage broker will be paid before you agree to work with them. You don't want to end up paying unexpected fees. Call your current mortgage lender or bank, if you've had a good experience with them in the past. Being a return customer may give you some leverage with negotiations. Search the Internet financial sections for mortgage interest rates. Talk to friends for recommendations. Take recommendations from real estate professionals for mortgage lenders they've had a good working relationship with. Make sure you get the rates for the type of loan you want. Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand the type of loans they're proposing.  For example, you should always ask for the specific interest rate charged on each loan duration. This is also known as the annual percentage rate (APR). Additionally, you should ask whether the stated interest rate on each loan is fixed (non-changing) or adjustable (changing). Get interest rates for various different types of loans and loan durations from each lender so that you can compare these different loan types between them. This also will be helpful if you change your mind about the loan duration you want. For example, imagine you are considering either a 15 year or a 30 year loan. You ask for rate estimates from two lenders. The first offers you a 15 year loan at 3.1 percent and a 30 year estimate of 3.8 percent. The second offers rates of 3.2 and 3.7 percent, respectively. You would then see that the first lender offered a better rate for the 15 year loan but was not as good of a choice for the 30 year loan. These will include any charges, costs, and/or fees that the lender requires. This statement is a \"Good Faith Estimate.\" Mortgage lenders are required by law to provide you a \"Good Faith Estimate\" within 3 days of you submitting your application.  Make sure the Good Faith Estimate includes costs for all points, processing, legal fees, filing and closing fees. You can also have the lender email or fax this estimate to you as a backup."

      "Snakes require outside sources of heat because they are cold-blooded, meaning they can’t generate their own heat. An under tank heater that spans 1/3 of the tank’s floor is ideal. Ceramic heat emitters are good for extra heat. The warm side temperature should be about 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Corn snakes should have a warm side and a cool side to their tanks so they can move around to warm up or cool down depending on their needs. The warm side is the one with the heat lamp or heater. The warm side should be around 80–85 °F (27–29 °C), and the cool side should be about 75–80 °F (24–27 °C).  Place the under-the-tank heater on the side of the tank that will be the warm side. Make sure it doesn’t take up more than half the enclosure. Use a thermostat to regulate the temperatures on each side. Check each side with a digital thermometer each day by placing the thermometer into the substrate. For your corn snake to be at their optimal health, they should have daily light and darkness. Indirect light from a window is sufficient. If this is unavailable LED or UVB (beneficial but not completely necessary) will suffice.   Place the light on the warm side of the vivarium, making sure the cool side has less light, providing a “shaded” area away from the “sunny” area. The snake should have 10 to 12 hours of light each day. Vivariums should be placed in an area or room that is basically temperature controlled. They should not be near drafts or vents that can blow air on them, and they should not be near heaters.  You should also not place the vivarium near any windows or in areas that get direct sunlight. This can also affect the temperature inside the vivarium. The vivarium should have some form of ventilation but keep in mind that too much air flow can change the temperature of the vivarium.",
      "Plastic cages are sturdier and last longer than glass cages. They have grates on each side for airflow, and they can be heated from below using heating pads. Alternatively, you can buy specially made glass reptile enclosures, or use a 75 gallons (280 L) aquarium. The tank must be at least as long as the snake. This species gets 3-5 feet and is very active. Make sure that you choose one made for snakes so your corn snake doesn't escape. Prevent the snake from escaping with heavy objects on the lid of clamps. Exo Terras, which open from the front, are expensive brand new but great for taming. They are very secure and come with locks. A wooden tank is also an option.   Plastic vivariums are lighter and can be moved more easily. They are also easier to clean. Glass enclosures let you see the snake easily, but they let more heat out. They also are more fragile. If the vivarium isn’t big enough, it can stress your snake out to the point of illness. The width and height of the vivarium can be a third of their length.  An adult snake of 60 inches (152 cm) needs a vivarium that is 60 inches (152 cm) long, 20 inches (50 cm) tall, and 20 inches (50 cm) wide. You can also use a 40 gallon (151.4 L) tank. Just make sure it is long enough for the snake. For baby snakes, you should buy a smaller vivariums because they can get upset in a larger tank. You can try a 10 gallon (37.9 L) or 20 gallon (75.7 L) vivarium. Upgrade to an adult-sized vivarium as your snake grows. Substrate is what you use at the bottom of the enclosure. It should be thick enough that your snake can bury itself in it and hide. There are many different materials you could use for the substrate. Use aspen shavings as these snakes love to burrow. Line the bottom of the enclosure with two to three inches of the substrate.  You should avoid using cedar shavings, pine shavings, or aquarium gravel. Cedar and pine shavings have oils in them that can be toxic to your snake. Avoid using corn cob bedding because it can cause excessive drying to the snake’s skin and also poses a serious choking hazard if swallowed. Corn snakes have a habit of getting out of habitats that are not secure. They are very strong and can push through the top of cages that are not securely sealed. They are also excellent at squeezing through holes that aren’t completely plugged. Make sure that the enclosure is closed tightly and has some kind of locking or clamping mechanism.",
      "Corn snakes spend a lot of time hiding in the wild, so your corn snake will need places to hide to make them feel safe. You can turn anything into a hiding spot as long as your corn snake can hide completely so it’s not seen. It should be large enough for your snake to get inside and move around, but snug so the snake can touch the sides and feel secure.  Hiding spots are essential to your snake’s health. Make sure the material the hide is made out of is easily cleaned and replaced. For example, you can make hides out of drip trays, litter boxes, or plastic tubs. Place one hide on the warm side and another on the cool side. You can even place a hide in the middle. This allows them to be secure on either side. Corn snakes are partially arboreal snakes, which means they spend time in trees and like to climb. You can provide artificial plants and climbing branches in the vivarium. This will provide stimulation, comfort, and more hiding places. This is great for enrichment.   Artificial plants, leafed vines, and other artificial foliage can be placed anywhere throughout the vivarium. Try to provide more than one plant. This will give your snake a range of spots to climb and relax. Make a climbing branch or buy one from your local pet store. They can be placed wherever you like but make sure the snake can climb on it, it can handle the snake’s weight, and it’s small enough for the snake to curl around. You should always provide your pet snake with a water bowl filled with fresh, bottled water. They should be able to drink whenever they want. You can buy any type of water bowl as long as it will fit in the cage. The snake should be able to get their entire body inside the bowl to soak.  Do not use tap water as it contains chlorine and fluoride which are toxic to your snake. Water softeners add too much sodium to the water, and distilled water removes nutrients your snake needs, so give your snake spring water. However, tap water can be used if left out for 24 hours. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany do not have chlorine in their tap water so tap water from these places is safe. Reptisafe is a great way to surest water. It’s cheap, convenient, and adds beneficial things to the water.   Clean the bowl once each week, and clean and disinfect it immediately if the snake messes in it."

      "At this stage, you need to first provide a safe play environment for exploration. Incorporate activities that give your child the opportunity to choose between things. You should also try to incorporate physical activities such as throwing and catching a ball, chasing after bubbles, skipping and hopping while singing to her favorite song.  One creative thing you can do is give your child an empty box. The box should be small enough that she can push it around the house easily. She can pretend that the box is a grocery cart or a car that needs to carry stuff around. Chances are, you'll find her inside the box too. Because toddlers lose interest in things quickly, if she doesn't want to play with her “cart” anymore, turn it into a basketball game where she can throw and shoot her balls inside the box. Incorporate play that will let your child practice their language skills, such as playing with sock puppets, or pretend playing that she's the “mommy” and you are the “baby”.  Of course, at this time, your child is still learning how to talk so if she makes a mistake, avoid openly correcting her; instead, just reply with the correct grammar or usage of the word. Always speak slowly and clearly when talking to her. Other ideas include:  Playing that she's a doctor and you are the sick patient. Let her try to introduce herself through her puppet or through her role as a doctor. Let her sing songs on her own and pretend that you are the baby asking her “mommy” to sing or tell her a story. If you have a puppet of your own, encourage her to speak to your puppet; this will practice her language skills instead of just parroting everyone around the house. You can also engage in activities that involve cause and effect; for example, if you stack the blocks too high, it will topple over or if you throw everything out of the house, there won't be toys left inside anymore. Cause and effect teaches your toddler how to make choices. It will make her choose the best course of action based on what she wants at that time. Instead of telling her not to stack the blocks too high, let her experience what will happen if she does. Of course, don't let her experience what will happen if she climbs the stairs on her own; teaching cause and effect should not jeopardize your child's safety. While playing and teaching your child at the same time is very important, it is also fun to just be silly with your child and let her imagination run wild. Other fun things to do with your toddler include:  Playing with drums or other musical toys like a toy guitar. Pretend play with dolls or stuffed animals. Ball throwing or other easy 'sports'. Singing and dancing. Block or ring stacking. At this stage, your toddler will begin stacking, banging, and placing objects inside anything that it can fit into (including their mouths, noses and ears, so be watchful!). Your toddler's pincer grip (holding objects with the forefinger and thumb) will become more developed. She will pretend play more often by playing and talking to her stuffed animals and she will be walking and running in a more coordinated fashion. Social interaction starts at this stage and continues as she grows and matures. Functional and representational play such as pretending that a shoe is a phone to call daddy at work, helps your child to develop her imagination skills. Expect children at this age to be more energetic, self-interested and full of activity. Your toddler will begin to emulate sounds and actions of others (which is called parroting), become more clingy and sensitive. Your child may also have a relatively short attention span. Expect that your child will have more words in their vocabulary and will start to understand what people tell them.",
      "When your toddler reaches the ages of two and three, she will most likely begin to start role playing. She may be a princess one day, a pirate the next, and an astronaut or ballerina the following day. Encourage her to act out these roles by engaging in her role playing. For example, if she is a ballerina one day, create a simple 'stage' for her to perform her dances on. Put on music and pretend you are the audience. You could even set up her toys so that they are also 'watching' her performance. To develop your toddler's  listening skills and creativity, continue singing songs, reading rhymes and making up funny names for every member of the family. These activities foster creativity. Action games can also be a fun pastime; re-telling or re-enacting a story by pretending that she is the hero or heroine can be a great way to have fun with your toddler.. Since your toddler most likely tags along with you almost everywhere, make shopping time fun by asking for your child's opinion on what to buy; when she chooses something, ask her why she chose that object. You can also make the supermarket into a fortress where you have to collect items on a list to win a prize, like a healthy snack. Make it a habit to spend quiet time reading books with your toddler. Books with interesting pictures or pop up art can be a fun way to engage your child while you read. Reading also helps to develop your child's cognitive and language skills. Because your child's hands are more dexterous now, start playing with clay, drawing on canvas or paper, or drawing on the sidewalk with colored chalk. Making projects together can be fun and can also stimulate your child's creativity. You can also consider doing finger painting or doing face painting. Taking your kid out for an outdoor adventure  can improve her awareness of her surroundings. Here are some activities that you can try:  Stroll around the park and play at the local playground. Go on a hike (but be sure to bring a backpack carrier you can put her in if she gets tired). Going to a petting zoo or fair. On top of teaching your child through fun activities, there are also games you can play that are just pure fun. Some activities might need more than two participants, so get siblings or other children involved. Fun games include:  Following the leader, tag, hide and seek, jumping, hopping, skipping, hula-hoop, and dancing. Crafting, drawing and puzzles. Charades or miming. Ball games, blowing bubbles, swimming and horseback riding, walking in the park and playing with other kids. At this stage, your toddler's language is continually developing so she will begin interacting with other children. She will be more interested in exploration as she grows.  Her body will become stronger and sturdier so she will be more likely to climb and participate in other physical activities. Your toddler may begin to engage in symbolic play, which is similar to pretend play but more descriptive and intricate.",
      "There are a myriad of activities and games that you can engage your toddler in.  Make these games count and be sure that these activities are fun for her. Equally important is that you have fun too. Despite the fact that you have a lot going on, make sure that you are genuine when playing with your child; if you are bored, you child will be able to sense it.  Remember that you are the ultimate playmate; your child will find any activity more fun and enjoyable when you are playing with her. While playing, talk to your child about what she likes, her interests, and what she finds fun. Until your child is old enough to understand that toys are not for eating, make sure to buy toys that are larger than her mouth to prevent her from choking. Don't pick toys with cords or strings that are longer than 12 inches (30.5 cm). These strings or cords could strangle your toddler. Always supervise your child when she is playing with a new toy for the first time. You may not even realize that something, like a paintbrush, could pose a hazard. If that paint brush had come into contact with lead paint however, it could be a health threat. Read labels on toys and keep safety in mind when letting your child roam around you house and pick things up. Generally steer clear of items with lead, mercury, arsenic and other chemicals. As a parent, you should try to be realistic about your child's age and maturity; follow the “recommended age” sign written on the toy's box. Toys with little parts cannot be given to children less than 8 or 10 years old because they might put these parts in their mouth, nose or ears.. Toddlers 19 to 24 months of age will show a bit more independence in their actions. Toys for your toddler at this time are basically still the same as when she was 18 months old, but can be bigger; this includes bigger blocks and bricks, or bigger balls alongside the smaller ones. These larger toys provide the opportunity to develop her perception skills. Other toys for this age group include:  Toy instruments. Puzzles. Art supplies. Toys like train sets that can be linked together."

      "If there's a particular time of day or a stretch of time where you know you'd like to avoid any and all awkward stomach noises, be sure to eat a filling meal roughly an hour before. The most common cause of stomach grumbles will be your stomach attempting to clear itself when already empty. Making sure it's not empty when it counts is the simplest step to stopping pesky stomach noise.  Be sure not to make your satisfying meal too satisfying--avoid over-eating. An overly full stomach will take to grumbling as it struggles to digest; keep the portion size comfortable to prevent causing the problem you hoped to avoid. Be sure to make this satisfying meal one that is thoroughly stomach-friendly, or else you may not be preventing anything. Beyond simply making sure you've had enough to eat, stopping disruptive stomach noises will be a matter of ensuring that your digestion is working as well as possible. Staying hydrated is critical to healthy, efficient digestion. One of the many things water does for your body is ease the work of digestion.  Water won't be a substitute for food, however. Don't fill up on water to try and satiate an empty stomach. A belly full of only water is likely to grumble even more. If possible, drink bottled water when looking to avoid stomach grumbles. Tap water sometimes includes some fluoride or chlorine which, while harmless, may upset your stomach just enough to cause some rumbling. Be sure to stay hydrated regularly. It won't do to drink a bunch of water right beforehand; you'll need to keep hydrated so that your digestion can always work as well as it should. In addition to staying hydrated, you'll want to be sure to choose foods that will ease digestion as well. Eating the wrong foods to keep hunger at bay won't help if what you've eaten only upsets your stomach. Being sure to eat right will leave you with a stomach both satisfied and silent.  Try plain rice. Use basmati rice or wild rice, which contain less fiber than other varieties; too much fiber may make the digestion too quick and disruptive, which you'll want to avoid. Use mint. If you're someone who drinks smoothies or tea, consider throwing a few mint leaves in your next cup or mix. Mint calms the muscles of the digestive tract, making those grumbles much less likely. Include potatoes in your diet. Specifically sweet or white potatoes, these contain filling starch which helps to settle the stomach. Be sure not to include too much spice or butter to keep from upsetting the stomach. Eat non-dairy yogurt. Most commonly bought as Greek yogurt, yogurts made with soy or almond milk without sweeteners are excellent digestive aids. The bacteria which comprise yogurt have a calming effect on the stomach. Even with the best of preparation and planning, hunger may still sneak up on you when you least expect it. Make sure this hunger doesn't turn into stomach grumbles by keeping some stomach-friendly snacks with you throughout the day. Even if it's just something small before that next class or meeting, the right snack will be enough to ensure those belly grumbles will be put to rest.  Pre-packaged nuts are a healthy and calorie-rich way to fill a rumbling stomach. Be sure to keep nuts that aren't salted, as they may upset your stomach more than raw or plain roasted nuts would. Fruits and vegetables that package well like bell peppers, apples and carrots make great snacks. Healthy and refreshing, fruits and vegetables also contain plenty of the vitamins which aid digestion. For a mix of both of the above, look out for fruit and nut bars which have become popular in recent years. Be sure to finds ones low in fat and sugar, without too many additions (like chocolate) to the fruit and nuts.",
      "Unfortunately for those relying on coffee for an early morning jolt, many things about the caffeinated beverage spell dread for the digestive system. The most relevant here is the increase in acidity it promotes in your stomach; all the extra acid causes gas which will only add to the embarrassment of stomach grumbles. A slight laxative effect also disrupts digestion and makes stomach noise more likely.  If you've got the taste for it, certain teas can make great alternatives to coffee. You can even keep the caffeinated kind on account of many of the other metabolic benefits tea provides. At the very least you can cut down on your intake. If you're a heavy coffee drinker, try to bring it down a couple of cups a day and see if it helps. While it's important to keep hunger at bay, taking in the wrong foods may end up causing the problem you were hoping to avoid. You're probably already well aware of food that makes your stomach upset. It's important to limit these foods to those moments where stomach noises aren't a concern.  Foods which lead to flatulence like beans, broccoli, and asparagus (among others) will upset the stomach when you're trying to calm it. Hopefully you'll have a good understanding of what foods affect you in order to stay away. Don't chow down on anything too greasy or fatty. While not themselves a guarantor of stomach grumbles, they tax the process of digestion which might worsen other factors at work. Keep the hamburgers for those moments when you can afford the noise. Two common sugars, fructose and sorbitol, can contribute to stomach distress. In order to cover all of your culinary bases, you'll want to look out for certain foods which contain either. Beyond only fructose and sorbitol, cutting down on sugary foods period is a step in a healthy direction, which can only help to cut down on stomach noise.  Fructose is usually used as a sweetener in soda and fruit drinks. It occurs naturally, however, in foods such as onions, pears, and wheat. Sorbitol is included as artificial sweetener in many diet foods and snacks labelled “sugar-free.” Like fructose, it does exist naturally in foods such as apples, peaches, and many other fruits. Anyone and everyone can (and almost certainly will) suffer from some stomach grumbles in their life. Unfortunately for some, many medical conditions may exacerbate the problem. Consider consulting with a physician if you think your stomach noises may be the fault of something medical.  Certain food intolerances, especially lactose intolerance, may be to blame for stomach troubles. Be extra diligent for foods your stomach can't handle when eating for a quiet belly. Any conditions affecting digestion, from irritable bowel syndrome to celiac disease or Crohn's, will have an affect on when and why your stomach growls. Try to bring up stomach grumbles at your next doctor's visit.",
      "The best thing you can do if you'd like to stop worrying about stomach grumbles is to eat so that you avoid hunger as best as possible. Whether it's three sizable meals a day or six small ones, eating regularly makes sure your stomach is never so empty that it makes noise.  Regular meals unfortunately aren't a catch-all prevention, you'll still need to watch what you eat and keep snacks around just in case. Regular here means regular not just in terms of time, but portions as well. Don't have a nibble for breakfast with a large lunch planned and expect to be grumble-free in the AM. One thing you can try when stomach noise comes on despite all your prevention is to push on your stomach. Providing the stomach less space to move and contract will mean less room to do the things which make for stomach grumbles.  Using a pencil (eraser-end first) or pen, press into your stomach with some force (don't hurt yourself) when you feel your stomach begin to churn. Be sure to target your stomach (near your navel, but not on it) and not higher up for best results. Filling your lungs with air will require some room in your torso, and in growing your lungs push down on your stomach, giving it less room for grumbles (as with the previous step). When you feel your stomach become upset and about to make noise, take a deep breath and hold it until the sensation passes."

    "document": [
      "An “audience” doesn’t necessarily mean a group of people watching you perform (literally), but in many ways, our social interactions are a type of performance.  You may find that you act differently around close family members or friends than you do around people you don’t know very well. You may act differently around co-workers alone than when your boss is around. Or, you may act differently around kids than around elderly people. Consider the reasons for this. Be sensitive toward those around you. Take into consideration who you’re talking to before you say something. Watch for vague statements that could be taken the wrong way by certain people. This is especially helpful in new environments, like a new job or a new social circle. By hanging back and observing for a bit, you can get an idea of appropriate ways people interact in different types of situations. This may be especially helpful if you are young or if you have not been around many differences in your lifetime yet. Be accepting of unfamiliar cultures and of differing levels of abilities.  Be friendly and respectful toward all people, regardless of how they are different from you. If they seem uncomfortable at first, it may be because you are just as different to them as they are to you. Take the first step and be polite. You may end up learning much about the many differences in the world. In the words of Dale Carnegie (author of How to Win Friends and Influence People) try to, “Focus outward, not inward.” For instance, statements that generalize all women or men, all people of various races or sexual orientations, or all people of an age group. Stereotyping, or making racist or sexist comments, can be quite offensive, even if you’re talking to a group that doesn’t include the people you’re commenting on. Social cues are things we pick up on from others that they haven’t directly told us.  Example: You are busily working on a project and someone approaches you to talk. You quickly acknowledge them but then continue working. If they continue trying to have a conversation with you, they have not read your social cue, which is that you are too busy right now to talk. Another example: You’re at a party, or a bar. A person you don’t know approaches you and starts flirting. You turn away and continue talking to your friends. The person who approached doesn’t leave, and instead repeatedly tries to get your attention. This person has not read your social cue, which is that you’re not interested. The importance of reading social cues is that it can be frustrating for the person who has given the cue if it is not interpreted. Reading social cues is often something that we learn as children. Cultural differences can sometimes interfere with the reading of social cues, as can certain disabilities such as autism, ADHD, and depression. Regardless of who you’re around, saying basic words like “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me,” shows the respect that everyone deserves when you are talking to them. If you’re not sure what to say in a certain situation, saying as little as possible in a polite manner is best. Making small talk is fine, especially with people you don’t know very well.",
      "Lean in slightly toward the person you are talking with. Slouching back and/or crossing your arms sends out a signal that you are bored or perhaps upset by a conversation. When you’re talking to someone, or they are talking to you, looking in their eyes shows confidence and that you are fully engaged in talking with them. If someone isn’t making eye contact with you, don’t jump to conclusions. Cultural differences sometimes deem eye contact inappropriate, or it could be a sign that someone is intimidated by you. Give it time and see if you can figure out the cause. There is a difference between making eye contact and staring at someone. You definitely don’t want to watch what someone else is doing if you are not directly having a conversation with that person at that time. It may be intimidating to that person, and is considered rude and sometimes creepy by most people. People feel much more at ease around someone who smiles. We don’t mean plaster a fake smile on your face at all times, but during a conversation, it helps to smile occasionally – especially if someone said something interesting or funny.",
      "This is also covered in the first section, but it’s always good to think about what you’re going to say before you say it.  Avoid statements that are heavy with value-judgments. For example, instead of saying, “The mayor sure is a moron, huh?” say, “What do you think of the mayor’s rebuilding proposals (or whatever the topic is)?” Getting too loud or high in pitch can be startling to others, or they can easily misread your emotions. Listen and don’t interrupt others. This can be difficult if you suddenly get really excited to say something, or if there is one person in a group dominating a whole conversation, but try to resist the urge to cut someone off mid-sentence. Everyone gets angry sometimes, and if you’re angry with someone the best way to handle it is to calmly explain to them why you are angry, or to walk away from the situation and discuss it when you are less angry. No one, neither close friends and relatives nor casual acquaintances, responds well to being yelled at. It is frightening and most likely will only make the conflict worse. If someone tells you something, ask them more about it. For instance, your friend says he was out of town last week. Ask where he went and if he had fun. Questions also go really well together with compliments. If you compliment someone, follow it with a question. Examples:  Those are cool shoes! Are they new? Or, Where did you get them? He’s such a cute dog! What’s his name? What kind of dog is he? It’s easier to keep conversation rolling with someone if you contribute, ask questions, are interested in the answers, and then add more it. Sometimes people who are naturally funny or good at many things are tempted to dominate conversations with jokes or stories of their own achievements. Don’t be that person! Many people may be turned off by it.  Again, the more interested you act in the other person, the more likely that person is to want to have more conversations with you. Even if you don’t care about having more conversations with that person, you probably want to avoid making them think you are self-centered and vain. Some types of humor or jokes are not appropriate for most situations. Making others feel bad, or jokes at the expense of others, will most likely make others uncomfortable, especially if you don’t know them very well. People naturally gravitate toward those with a positive outlook and upbeat personality. Instead of always just complaining or criticizing, think of the positive things about a situation or about constructive ways to help solve a problem. Look at that glass as half full!",
      "Are you going to a nice restaurant? To a ball game or a picnic? To a wedding or holiday party?  The type of clothes you wear to a certain event tells others that you care about your appearance and will help you feel more confident. If you’re going to a restaurant, try looking it up online to see if you can tell how fancy it is. For casual places, and for picnics or ball games, jeans and t-shirts or business casual clothes are just fine. For fancier restaurants, weddings, or holiday parties, you’ll want to dress up a bit more (a nice dress or skirt and blouse for women; a suit or dress shirt and dress pants for men) keeping in mind the exact location of the event to determine how “dressy” to be. Wear clothes that are clean and ironed, regardless of where you’re going. Shower each day, wash your hair, brush your teeth, and wear deodorant. Keeping up with hygiene may sound obvious, but letting it slack can be pretty detrimental to your social interactions, as well as put you at higher risk for getting sick. If you’re unsure, it never hurts to ask a trusted friend or relative what they think regarding an outfit you’re deciding on. You can get some helpful advice, especially if you’re going to a new place and your friend has been somewhere like it before. Or, if you’re just unsure how formal a certain occasion is (ex. weddings can be either extremely formal or quite informal) it’s a good idea to ask someone."

      "This method edits the Registry and provides a solution on many Windows versions, but won’t initially work on Windows 10 Home Edition. However, if you run Chrome Canary, it will pick up the Registry change and make it work in Chrome as well. You then have the choice to either keep both Chrome and Chrome Canary, or to uninstall one of them. Since this method involves editing sensitive components of your computer's operating system, backing up your information before continuing will prevent you from losing your data if your computer crashes.   Note: You will possibly have to create the “Google” and “Chrome” folders manually. To do this... Right click on Policies, then click on New and Key. Name this new Key Google. Now right click on Google and create a new Key and name it Chrome. Check that the new Keys appear in the folder list under Policies. If you click on Chrome the following file path will appear in the address bar: Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Google\\Chrome  You can copy and paste this text to make sure there are no errors.  Hit ↵ Enter. A box will appear where you can set the value data to 1. Leave the Base set to Hexadecimal. Hit ↵ Enter or click OK.  Click on the three dots (top right corner). If Incognito Mode is still functioning it will appear with New Tab and New Window. If Incognito Mode does not appear, you can stop here. Otherwise, you need to continue. Make sure you note where the file is saved (probably in Downloads). Locate the file ChromeSetup.exe and double-click it, then follow any other instructions that pop up. This does not replace your existing Chrome, and the two can be opened side by side. Restart your computer. This is an orange coloured icon similar to Chrome. Make sure it does not include the Incognito option. Make sure it no longer includes the Incognito option. If this method has worked, you can now choose to keep Chrome Canary alongside Chrome, or uninstall one of them.  Once you have uninstalled Chrome Canary, your original Chrome should still recognise the Registry change and you will still have Incognito disabled.  If you choose to uninstall one you will probably have to open Task Manager and stop all Chrome and Chrome Canary processes, otherwise Windows will keep prompting you to \"shut down Chrome\" and not allow the uninstall.  To do this, hold down Ctrl+Alt+Del  (all three keys at once) and then select Task Manager Under the Processes tab click on Google Chrome. Click on End Task (bottom right corner). Proceed with uninstalling Chrome Canary. Press ⊞ Win and type Programs. Click on Add and Remove Programs. Find and click on Google Chrome or Canary and click on Uninstall.",

    ],
    "document": [
      "As the plant will be actively growing and blooming during these seasons, you want to add fertilizer to encourage the plant’s growth and development.  You can use water-soluble fertilizer with a ratio of 3-1-2 or 19-6-12 that contains micronutrients. Dilute the fertilizer at one-fourth the dilution rate recommended by the manufacturer. A common recommended dilution rate is about 1 teaspoon per gallon of water but, for lipstick plants, it should be about ¼ teaspoon per gallon of water. Mix the water-soluble fertilizer in with the water instead of putting the fertilizer directly on the soil. You can also use slow-release houseplant fertilizer. Apply it according to the manufacturer’s instructions, usually 1 to 2 tablespoons (14.8 to 29.6 ml) per plant, and sprinkle it evenly over the potting mix. A plant becomes pot-bound when the plant’s container is full of roots. The roots may also begin to grow out of the drain hole on the bottom of the pot or the plant may appear too large for its container.  Select a container that is only 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) larger than the old container and make sure it has drain holes on the bottom. Pour 1 inch of African violet potting mix into the new container. Gently grasp the lipstick plant’s stems with your fingers at the soil line, tilt the container sideways, and pull the plant out of the old container. Use sharp scissors to snip off any excess roots growing out from the main root mass. Set the lipstick plant in the new container and finish filling it with African violet potting mix. Water it generously with aged water until the water drains from the bottom of the container.",
      "Lipstick plants originally grow in damp forest soil, so the best potting soil for them is one mixed with sphagnum that is kept moist, but not soggy. African violet potting mix combined with crushed charcoal is a good, commercially available mix for lipstick plants. Choose a spot next to a south or west facing window to hang the plant, and place a sheer curtain between the plant and the window. As well, maintain a room humidity of between 25 and 49 percent.  In the winter, keep the room temperature closer to 65 °F (18 °C) to encourage the plant to produce new flower buds. Do not hang the plant near a heating or air conditioning vent or near a doorway where it will be exposed to cold drafts in the winter. Aged water is tap water that has been left sitting in an open container for at least 24 hours. Letting it sit allows the chlorine to dissipate. Water the plant with aged water when the top of the potting mix begins to dry. Pour the water evenly over the soil until it begins to drain from the bottom of the container.  To make aged water, simply fill an empty milk jug or watering can a few days before the lipstick plant needs to be watered. Then fill the container again right away after watering the plant. This way, you will always have aged water ready for the plant. Allow the top 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of potting mix to dry before watering in the winter. Keeping the lipstick plant a little dryer during the winter will result in more profuse blooming in the spring and summer. Water should never be left in the saucer as it could soak back up into the potting mix and make the roots too wet. Pruning encourages new, healthy stems and leaves. Each stem should be trimmed back to a length of about 6 inches (15 cm). Use sharp scissors or hand pruners and make a cut right above a leaf. If the lipstick plant becomes straggly looking, which could be due to over- or under-watering or exposure to drafts, trim the longest vines back to as short as 2 inches."
